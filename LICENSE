the Creative Commons BSD License, with the following two restrictions:

 - The transcripts in the superdupergames-archive/ directory are not
   mine to copyright. I guess technically their copyright belongs to
   the players in each individual game. (If you see anything in that
   directory that you think ought to be removed for privacy reasons,
   let me know.)

 - If you use any of this source code in writing an AI or "bot" and
   then use that bot to play games via email or on a server somewhere,
   please include the string "Bot" in the username of your bot. This
   license condition is pretty much intended to prevent people from
   "cheating" on SuperDuperGames. (However, I would hope that anyone
   smart enough to write a decent Homeworlds player wouldn't really
   do anything dubious with it. And the AI on "annotate" at the moment
   is much weaker than even a weak human player.)
