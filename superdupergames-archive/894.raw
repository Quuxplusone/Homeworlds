1) andylooney: Homeworld B1 G2 Y3
	Tuxhedoh: I'm fairly new to the game, and a bit intimdated to be playing you. Feel free to give me any tips, especially if I've made a silly move.    Also, if you happen to get to Baltimore or Columbia area would love to play face to face.

5) andylooney: Trade Y1 G1 Andylooney
	andylooney: Oh, no! I just realized you didn't take a large ship with your homeworld! That's a critical mistake! Frankly, the software ought to force you to start with a large ship.

6) Tuxhedoh: Trade B1 G1 Tuxhedoh
	Tuxhedoh: I was reading that in the SDG wiki page for Homeworlds... and realized I didn't do it. I'm trying to understand why it's critical though... can you explain?
	Tuxhedoh: is it because otherwise you have to wait to use up most of thee pieces before you're able eto construct onee?  (btw, my "e" is broken)

7) andylooney: Build G2 Andylooney
	Tuxhedoh: Has anyone created a newbies guide to Homeworlds strategy besides http://wiki.daltons.ca/sdg/games/homeworlds ? I've been looking on the wunderland page and icehouse wiki, but it seems like there's none eto be found
	andylooney: yes, that's why. And we can keep playing this and I'll demonstrate why in a while.

13) andylooney: Build Y1 Andylooney

14) Tuxhedoh: Trade G3 R3 Tuxhedoh
	andylooney: OK, I'm going to be a nice guy here, and let 2 wrongs make a right. You've got 4 greens in your homeworld (remember, the star itself does count) so I should just call Catastrophe on you. But I won't, since you forgot to take a large before, and now you have one. But I doubt I'll be so gentle next time... :)

15) andylooney: Build G3 Andylooney
	Tuxhedoh: 2 wrongs make a right. :-) thanks for the leniency. Last night while playing IRL, i won my first game by  forcing a catastrophe in the other players homeworld, taking his 3 ships there. And then lost the next, by calling a catastrophe in my homeworld, taking my last ship. What a stupid mistake... but I'm learning.
