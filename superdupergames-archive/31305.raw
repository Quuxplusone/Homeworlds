	w00t: I'm not 100% certain I should be able to make that move.... Is it legal to not call my catastrophe until after I build my third g3, or is it mandatory for the catastrophe to occur before I continue building?

Move G2 Meph W00t
Catastrophe W00t G
	fogus: It seems ok to me.... so to speak. :)

	Draw5PlayAll: You can call catastrophe at any time on your turn, and you need not wait.
 
Also, you could do (assuming 2 reds at system X) sac Y3, move R1 to X, move R1 to X, catastrophe, move R3 to X.
	w00t: I get all that, but if I was sitting across the table from an opponent the catastrophe would have been called as soon as I built that second green ship in the fogus system, so my last build would have been a g1 instead of the g3 I was able to build
	Draw5PlayAll: Sure. You can also do it later if you want.
	Draw5PlayAll: In fact, a while back the rule was you could *only* call catastrophe at the end... but now it is completely flexible.
 
Another situation: you need to access the enemy's homeworld but the ONLY way in is through a system with 3 of the color you want. You can breeze through it, as if the radiation levels were not present long enough...
	fogus: Thank you for the game.  
	w00t: :o  How did I miss that?
That was a very fun game!  Rematch anytime :)
