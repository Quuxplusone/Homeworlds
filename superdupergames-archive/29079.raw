	Felix: I'm not sure this site implements the rules correctly. In the official rules from Andrew Looney, you can catastrophe at any point in your turn. I was going to catastrophe my own system and then sacrifice my y2 to move both my greens from my homeworld to yours, but the system won't let me do that
	Felix: It was a crazy idea and I really wish it would work :p 

22) ts52: Trade G3 R3 Ts52

23) Felix: T G3 Y3 Ice
	ts52: That is a very interesting play. I don't think I've ever seen anyone intentionally create a catastrophe in their homeworld

24) ts52: Build G3 Grover
	Felix: I thought it would be a very unique form of attack, and it would have been effective if the rules were implemented differently! Now I know catastrophes must take place at the end of a turn...

	ts52: Thanks for the game!
	Felix: You too! I left myself wide open after that failed attack by destroying my own homeworld. It was fun though! I'm always up for a rematch.
	ts52: Yeah, it was an interesting gambit, but didn't work out for you. Always happy to play another game.
