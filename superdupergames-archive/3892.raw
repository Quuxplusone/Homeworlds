	zoltar: Greetingz, Earthling!  Nice to see you again.  I usually take the two smaller stars and start with yellow and blue, but now that I've played a lot, I'll try a new opening, as I notice that good players often start with a red star for defence.  Btw, how is your sick friend doing?
	Laurie_Menke: Greetings, zoltar.  This Earthling wishes you all that is good and for peace between us.  ;o)
 
My friend is doing much better...thanks for asking!  This was her third cancer surgery and her odds were pretty grim, but it looks like she beat the odds again.  Woo-hoo!  She'll have to do another round of chemo, but nothing had spread, so she should fully recover.  :o)

	zoltar: It looks like the strange moves turned out to be fatal!
	zoltar: Since you sacrificed your defending G3 ship, rendering your homeworld defenseless, there seems to be no reason not to immediately invade with my big ship.  Resistance is futile!
	Laurie_Menke: Yeah, my plan was definitely flawed.  :o(  Oh, well...live and learn.  But I don't think you have any way to attack me yet, do you?

17) zoltar: Sacrifice G3 Zoltar
Build G2 Laurie_menke
Build G3 Laurie_menke
Build G3 Laurie_menke
Catastrophe Laurie_menke G
	zoltar: Yes.  If you would have traded one of your green ships, I would trade my g3 in the Zoltar homeworld for an R3, then sac it next turn and capture all your pieces. However, in this case, I only needed to build a green ship in your homeworld to create a catastraphe, which leaves your homeworld empty, ending the game.
	Laurie_Menke: Alas...you're right again.  :o(  I seem to be getting worse at this game the more I play instead of better.  :o(  Oh, well...it's still a very enjoyable game.  Thanks for the fun, and congrats!
