Winner: Babamots

1) Babamots: Homeworld B2 R1 G3
	Babamots: For the record, this is for the tournament. And this is the AI account? I'm impressed with its performance so far. I didn't suppose it would be good enough to beat anyone.

2) speardane: Homeworld Y3 G2 B3

3) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots
	speardane: Indeed, speardane is an AI. It's really not GOOD enough to beat anyone; it's just that some players have played BAD enough to get beaten by it. ;)

	Babamots: Do you ever cringe when you see the moves your AI chooses?

13) Babamots: Build Y2 Babamots
	speardane: Specifically one move near the end of game 34513, yes. Generally the bad moves aren't so blatant that I bother to notice. I just cut-and-paste back and forth without trying to analyze on the fly, because that'd just confuse me in my OWN tournament games. :)

Catastrophe Speardane Y
	speardane: Well, that was an example of a move that I think was obviously suboptimal, unless I'm missing something. :P
	Babamots: Looks like I've been moving too quickly in this game. I didn't give your AI enough credit. I didn't notice that coming, but I think I still win in a couple of moves.

48) speardane: Pass
	Babamots: Oh, you mean you AI's move was suboptimal. I just checked the archive view and yes, I should have lost just now. Dang. Well, thanks for entering the move honestly. That's very embarrassing on my part.
	Babamots: I should have catastrophe'd that yellow fleet in my orbit, but I didn't want to delay my victory by even one move. Shoulda seen it was a serious threat.

49) Babamots: Build G2 Speardane
Catastrophe Speardane G
	speardane: Wow, that really was close -- I believe if speardane had moved g3 to your homeworld instead of bizarrely going after those two medium ships at Lebling, it would have been game over the other way. Pretty coincidental you started this game by asking if speardane ever did anything boneheaded! :)
	Babamots: That's the move I saw too. I nearly swallowed my tongue when I saw I should have lost. Overall, it plays much better than I expected. A little tuning and maybe it'll get me next time. Thanks for the game!
	Draw5PlayAll: 1. Why is speardane referring to self in third person?
2. What are Bolarus and Lebling?
	Draw5PlayAll: Oh. Who is the primary (human) account for speardane? Is the code on github?
	Babamots: ajo operates the "speardane" AI. I think it uses code that's on the GitHub project I think you've asked about before, though maybe he uses a private, updated version.
In Star Trek, Bolarus is the homeworld of the Bolians. The have blue skin and are usually bald. The "Bank of Bolius" is an important one for people trying to keep their finances secret.
I don't know what Lebling is. He named that one.
	Draw5PlayAll: I would like to find a link
	Babamots: My profile has a link to ajo's AI project on GitHub.
	Draw5PlayAll: Oh I did not know that ajo and Quuxplusone were the same person.
	speardane: I just noticed this conversation. The code on the GitHub is indeed the code used by speardane in this tournament, except for one game (against mneme) where I decided to try an alpha-beta search thing that ended up not working very well.
	speardane: The AI's default system names are all surnames of pioneers in computer gaming/AI, except for "Delos," which is a reference to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(film) . "Lebling" in this context is therefore a reference to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Lebling .
