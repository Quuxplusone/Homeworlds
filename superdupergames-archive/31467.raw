Homeworlds Online (SDG# 31467)
Started: 2017.2.18, Ended: 2017.5.9
Participants: fogus (S), SoaringPilot (N)
Winner: fogus

1) SoaringPilot: Homeworld R3 B2 G3

2) fogus: Homeworld B1 G2 Y3

3) SoaringPilot: Build G1 Soaringpilot

4) fogus: Build Y1 Fogus
	SoaringPilot: So given this is a learning game, and we've both established our homeworlds, may I ask why you built it that way?
	SoaringPilot: PM if you prefer, since apparently there's an audience :-o 

5) SoaringPilot: Trade G1 Y1 Soaringpilot
	fogus: I built that way for two reasons: to keep you far away (based on connections) and because I've been playing around with the Y3 opening recently.  It hasn't worked well for me so far I'll admit.  :)
	SoaringPilot: haha fair enough :)

6) fogus: Trade Y1 G1 Fogus

7) SoaringPilot: Build Y1 Soaringpilot

8) fogus: Trade G1 B1 Fogus
	SoaringPilot: I'm not entirely sure what to do in the early game because there's nothing to react to. So, make a bunch of ships, and make them at a safe distance from the homeworld.

9) SoaringPilot: Discover Y1 Soaringpilot G1 Wolf359
	fogus: Opening "theory" is definitely not my strong suit.  I try to look out for problems getting shut out of certain colors mostly and also try to keep a mix of colors in play.  It's a delicate balance I've found.
	SoaringPilot: Oh this was dumb. I didn't need to make a second yellow ship in my home system. I could have made any colour and still been able to move out of the system because of the other yellow ship. Ugh. Oh well.

10) fogus: Build B1 Fogus

11) SoaringPilot: Build G1 Soaringpilot
	fogus: That's is not too bad because you currently have a lead in yellow and I'm hesitant to make another Y1 because that would let you get into the Y2s first.
	SoaringPilot: Oh that's diabolical. I can't build blue ships right now so you're completely safe to build the last small one.

12) fogus: Discover B1 Fogus G3 Plop

13) SoaringPilot: Trade G1 R1 Soaringpilot
	fogus: I could, but I have to get into a safe system to build which gives you a moment to react to my blue rush.
	SoaringPilot: Yeah that was a juicy-looking Bluebird situation if only I had a blue ship :P

14) fogus: Build B2 Plop
	SoaringPilot: Oh that's a cool thing with a green star and a blue ship. Green lets you build more things, blue lets you trade them. I'll have to keep that in mind in future games. I suppose you could also do it with a blue star and a green ship.

15) SoaringPilot: Move R1 Soaringpilot Wolf359
	fogus: I like the potential of my opening system, but I haven't quite figured it out yet.  

16) fogus: Trade B2 R2 Plop
	SoaringPilot: Yeah it seems very flexible. Mine is mainly about defence.

17) SoaringPilot: Build R1 Wolf359

18) fogus: Build B2 Plop
	SoaringPilot: Let's hope gathering the fleet at Wolf 359 works better here than it did in Star Trek.

19) SoaringPilot: Build G1 Soaringpilot
	fogus: I don't think I saw that one.  :(
	SoaringPilot: The episode is Best of Both Worlds (Part 1 and 2) when Capt. Picard gets captured by the Borg.
	SoaringPilot: The number of blue ships you have does not make be feel good at all.

20) fogus: Build B2 Fogus

21) SoaringPilot: Move G1 Soaringpilot Wolf359
	fogus: Right, this is a blue rush.  The only way to avoid a shut out is to trade for a blue.  This'll keep me from getting them all.
	SoaringPilot: Oh that's what you meant earlier. OK.
I thought about trading earlier, when you snagged the last blue and I realized what a pickle I was in. But I'd have to trade my green large. And then I'll have to choose between making myself vulnerable to a catastrophe at home, and not having a Large at home. Ugh.
	SoaringPilot: *the last small blue, I mean
	fogus: It's a tight spot for sure.  Try to think through the moves if you trade for a large blue.  Keep in mind that I can't build one in my home world.

22) fogus: Build B3 Plop
	SoaringPilot: Sorry for dropping off the face of the earth there. I've been travelling for work. This month is super busy.
	fogus: No rush on my end.  Glad you're back.

23) SoaringPilot: Discover G1 Wolf359 B3 Komarr

24) fogus: Discover B1 Fogus B3 Boo

25) SoaringPilot: Build G1 Komarr

26) fogus: Trade B2 G2 Plop

27) SoaringPilot: Build G2 Soaringpilot
	SoaringPilot: Ugggghhh of course I have no medium ships to swap for that blue

28) fogus: Sacrifice B2 Fogus
Trade B3 Y3 Plop
Trade Y3 G3 Fogus

29) SoaringPilot: Trade G2 B2 Soaringpilot
	SoaringPilot: well that's not what i thought would happen

30) fogus: Move R2 Plop Wolf359
	fogus: I didn't want to get shut out of green.  :)

31) SoaringPilot: Move Y1 Wolf359 Komarr
	SoaringPilot: AUGH!

32) fogus: Attack R1 Wolf359
	SoaringPilot: This seems potentially catastrophic.
