Winner: jeep

1) TwoShort: Homeworld B1 R2 G3

2) jeep: Homeworld B1 R2 G3
	jeep: Wow, didn't take fortress because you want to see if you can get out of it?  I'm sure you won't have quite so many wasted moves.  ;)

3) TwoShort: Pass

4) jeep: Build G1 Jeep
	TwoShort: Well, I figured the point of playing an unrated game was to do the experiment.  If taking fortress is the way to go, then I'm convinced 2nd1st is worse than 1st1st; ditto for the other opening I considered: g1b2-G3.  They might stop the one strategy, but even if they do I think they're not as good as being second in 1st1st.

	jeep: I think making this a small universe was a mistake.

18) jeep: Move B2 Jeep Grogar
	jeep: Hmm... I feel like I should go total aggro to get you out of blue again, but wonder if that is smart.  ;)
	TwoShort: I agree about the small universe.  If I'd done it with red I could have immediately attacked everything you moved out of your Homeworld.  But in terms of going for the monopoly, Goldilocks is better because you could have built a b2 instead of your second y2, then moved to the last b2 before I got it.
	TwoShort: As far as the all out attack to get me out of blue again, I'm refraining from comment at the insistence of my competitive nature :)

	TwoShort: I saw that catastrophe coming and decided the net result of my build and that was a positive for me.  But, ouch! Somehow I feel much more doomed now.
	jeep: Nod, it was net positive for you.  Now I have three different things that I want to do... I need to determine what the right order is.
	jeep: Sorry, Easter yesterday and tonight is busy, so probably no move until tomorrow.

63) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort
	jeep: So last turn, should I have moved the two B3s into your homeworld and forced you to catastrophe them away?  I figured this forced you to spend a turn changing color and keeps me moving towards doomsday.
	TwoShort: I think you probably made the right choice.  One of the classic ways to blow a dominant position like yours is to use up all your piece advantage destroying half a homeworld.  You don't necessarily need to wait for a full doomsday machine, but you want to be looking at the situation after blowing up the first half, and feel like there's no way they can stop you.  And my general rule is any move that forces the opponent to make one specific move in response is probably good, because that's probably not what they wanted to be doing.

	TwoShort: good game!
	jeep: Thanks, it was a good game.  I think that is a decent handicap for us.  ;)  I still had to think to get the win and you were able to hold out for a long time.  I think that it shows that 2nd1st is pretty unbalanced.
