Homeworlds Online (SDG# 3181)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2006.4.20, Ended: 2006.4.29
Participants: cdiffell (S), Aaron (N)
Winner: Aaron

1) Aaron: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3
	cdiffell: I feel bad forcing you to teach me 3 different games...but I guess I have to learn for the tournament. Hope it's OK. Caleb
	Aaron: It doesn't bother me at all!!  This is another toughie.  Make sure you've read the rules and the wiki thoroughly.  Trust the systems warnings regarding the best Homeworld setup when it's your turn, and don't hesitate to ask any questions!!

2) cdiffell: Homeworld B3 Y1 G3
	Aaron: Remember that it is not wise to create a homeworld with the same star sizes as your opponent.  I can't remember if the system warns you of that or not =)
	cdiffell: I read through the rules today, but I will re-read tonight or tomorrow and probably not make my first move till lunch time
	Aaron: Take your time.  I'm in no hurry.
	cdiffell: How do I build a homeworld with a different size than yours? There are only 3 sizes, and you've used 2 of them, so by definition I have to double up one of them when I build my homeworld.
	cdiffell: OK, I looked at another game of this and will just sort of mimic those starting moves at first.

3) Aaron: Build G1 Aaron
	Aaron: I mean the exact same sizes.  If we both had starts sized 1 and 2 then I'm only 2 moves away from your Homeworld.  By using 1 and 3, I'm now at least 3 moves away.  Safety first! =)
	Aaron: This game is all about resource management.  You want to manage the global stash to minimize the number of ships I can own.

4) cdiffell: Build G1 Cdiffell

5) Aaron: Trade G1 Y1 Aaron

6) cdiffell: Trade G1 Y1 Cdiffell
	Aaron: Here's an example.  If you choose to take that last small Yellow, then I have access to size-2 yellows.  This is sometimes unavoidable, but something you want to be aware of at least.
	cdiffell: Why would you take a green and then trade to a yellow? Doesn't that waste a turn? Your green 3 ship supported a build action for a yellow ship, right?
	Aaron: no, you can only build a ship of certain colour that you currently control in the system.  *Now* I can freely build yellows.
	cdiffell: OK, I see.

7) Aaron: Build Y2 Aaron

8) cdiffell: Discover Y1 Cdiffell G2 Cdiffell2
	cdiffell: Question: if I create a new system that's a "3", are you prohibited from moving directly there due to your system being a "3" in total?
	Aaron: no, only if one of the individual stars is a 3
	cdiffell: ...so I should build a 1 or 2 size system; I guess probably a 2 so I can move back/forth from my home system but you cannot, right?
	Aaron: You will only be able to build a 2 right now as your system contains a 1 and a 3.  I can only discover a 3.

9) Aaron: Discover Y2 Aaron G3 Emeralds

Catastrophe Cdiffell2 Yellow
	cdiffell: About having time - I did the grad school thing while working full-time; it definitely doesn't leave much time for other stuff. I'm just glad I got it finished before my daughter came along...

26) cdiffell: Trade G1 R1 Cdiffell
	cdiffell: I don't remember what the system looked like - did mine disappear due to having 4 blue items in it?
	Aaron: I moved a blue in there creating 4 and I called a catastrophe, yes.

27) Aaron: Build G1 Aaron

28) cdiffell: Discover R1 Cdiffell Y2 Cdiffell4

29) Aaron: Discover G1 Aaron B3 Sky
	cdiffell: <sigh> My systems seem to last a depressingly short time in Known Space.
	Aaron: =D  That's not uncommon.  You just have to always watch for that magic number 4.

30) cdiffell: Build G1 Cdiffell

31) Aaron: Build G1 Sky

Attack R1 Sky

36) cdiffell: Build G1 Cdiffell
	cdiffell: ah, so you can use a ship in one system to capture another? Hmm. didn't realize that.

37) Aaron: Move R1 Sky Cdiffell4
	Aaron: Once you sacrifice a ship, you can use its power in *any* system in which you have influence.  Very powerful tactic.

38) cdiffell: Build G2 Cdiffell
	cdiffell: "Influence" defined as the presence of your ship(s) there. I see.
	Aaron: exactly.  Technically you could, for example, sacrifice your g1 in CDIFFELL and build a green in CDIFFELL4.
