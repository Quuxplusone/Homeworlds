	zoltar: Well, you could have sacrificed that y1 and moved one of the big ships to 'expansion' instead, I think.
	dethdukk: true...  I think that I will be a little better off in the long run this way.  

50) dethdukk: Discover B3 Dethdukk R2 Reboot

51) zoltar: Build R1 Smallstep
	dethdukk: yeah, I knew it was gunna happen when you made the Y3.  I was trying to decide if I should try to save a ship or not.  I think you'll get me in the long run, it takes too long to grow using blues as a main I think, so you are slowly out-growing me...  but yet sure tho, we'll see.  I'm off for tonight.
	zoltar: Reboot is right -- it's a whole new game!
	zoltar: I'm going to bed -- will come back to this with a fresh look later!

Build R3 Zoltar
Build Y2 Chess
Build Y2 Smallstep
	zoltar: Yeah, I was afraid of that, but yellow is so crucial, that I was going to have to give up at least one R3 if I wanted to get into the Yellow industry. I might as well go for more yellow, then, now that you've got a red ship.

60) dethdukk: Move Y1 Dethdukk Reboot
	zoltar: Ok, I can do that too!

61) zoltar: Trade R3 Y3 Zoltar

62) dethdukk: Trade B3 G3 Dethdukk
	zoltar: There have been more large ship swaps and sacks in this game than in any homeworlds game I've ever played, I think.

63) zoltar: Discover R1 Smallstep B3 Blueyoudonthave
	dethdukk: I think its cause we both went for different colors, and we both succeeded.  or something.

65) zoltar: Sacrifice Y3 Smallstep
Discover R1 Zoltar B1 Wormhole
Move R1 Wormhole Reboot
Move R1 Blueyoudonthave Reboot
Catastrophe Reboot R
	zoltar: Well, this is looking too dangerous, so I think once again, I'll simplify us down, and take the interest I get after the simplification.

66) dethdukk: Build B1 Dethdukk
	dethdukk: narg, ya got me... that should be game in a couple turns.  didnt see that you could do that, I'da moved the red ship outta there.  cant believe I didnt see it actually.  well gg, I'd like to play you again when college calms down once more.

67) zoltar: Trade Y3 G3 Chess
	zoltar: I was expecting you to move your red ship to challenge my small red ship. Then I sack my Y2 and move my two R2's into the system and blow up your red ship, still retaining my Y3. But leaving both the B3 and R3 in the reboot system meant I could sac a Y3 and just the two R1's and take out two of your large ships leaving me with the two-to-one large ship ratio, which gives me too much of an advantage now. The move of the R1 was to both block your growing the B3 and threaten to blow up reboot so I figured I'd get to knock out your R3 and take away your only gun again when you moved it to respond.

	dethdukk: yeah, I'm gunna have to forfeit.  If I move out, you move and capture me, if I stay in my homeworld, you catastrophy my ships soon as I get past 2.  gg as before, I'll ask for another when I have more time.  was very fun
	zoltar: Ok. Yeah, you can't expand, and I'm gonna sack my G3 for all 3 remaining yellows next move, freezing you out of the yellow as well, and then just slowly build until I have a doomsday machine and can sack Y3's two turns in a row to move in and blow up your double star. There's really nothing you could do. I'd like to go back and have you redo the move before I blew up the reboot system, but the system isn't sophisticated enough to allow it.
