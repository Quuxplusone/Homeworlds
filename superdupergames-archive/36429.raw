	Babamots: I'll give you one more turn to defend yourself. When your opponent has a red ship, you almost always need to get a red ship as well.

	Babamots: I forgot that it was today that this game started. Most people on SDG move much less often.
	StormCrow: Work from home is slow, so I get to play async more often for the moment. Now I'm a bit stumped, obviously I just gave you a turn to do something you'd want to do anyway, but now i have to either abandon the B2 or move it again (or throw good ships after bad).
	Babamots: Yeah, I'm working from home too. I have a special "ding" for when I get an SDG email, so I can respond quickly. Sometimes I get to move before my opponent is able to undo something that they quickly regretted. ;-)

	StormCrow: Well I felt i was doing ok keeping up with ships until later in the game this time at least.  Against wil I managed to destroy half his homeworld in a game, but then couldn't close it.  Only need to lose another 990 games... oh wait, that's Go....
	Babamots: You had me thinking harder this time for sure. And it's a significant achievement to half-beat wil, well done!
 
I hadn't heard that go-saying before--that you should lose your first 50 or 100 or 1000 games as quickly as possible (depending on whom you ask). Some people start beating HW experts after just a few games, so I think we need to develop stronger experts.
