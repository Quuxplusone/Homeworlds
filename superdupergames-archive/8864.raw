	Mr_Shine: Slight adjustment, as I can't think of anything better to do. (After the game would it be possible for you to tell me what you would have done here?)
	zoltar: Actually, I would have made one of those moves as well.  I'm getting pretty good at the game, but in positions like these I'm usually in a fog as well, and still am not too sure what I'm doing, and just try to make the most tactical threats at once and go for getting bigger pieces. I'm super busy so I'll have to put this on hold and think about it, as this is a tough position for me as well.

	Mr_Shine: Congratulations. Good game.
	zoltar: You were doing fine up till that last sack, and you'd be fine now if you only had another y2 to sack to bring your y3 back home, or if your y3 were only one jump away.  Without a 3-pip ship able to get to your homeworld the next turn, it's almost always disastrous to leave your homeworld unprotected by a 3-pip ship.
	zoltar: Thanks. Good game.
