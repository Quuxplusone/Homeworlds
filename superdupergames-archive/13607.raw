3) Joe: Build B1 Joe

4) ZackStack: Build G1 Zackstack

5) Joe: Build B1 Joe
	ZackStack: Well... I just learned a rule I had missed in my tabletop games!  I thought you could build any color of ship if you had green tech... The restriction on like color ships will require more planning!
	Joe: Yup, thought about it also in that way...

	ZackStack: Nice work blocking up the blue ships for a bit!  It looks like I'm behind the learning curve now that I can't spawn any color ship I want!

12) ZackStack: Build G1 Azure
	Joe: That may be pure luck, not a strategy (for now) ;)

	Joe: We shall see... I am off home so dont know about playing today yet. Maaan this is interesting, I might get it on a table at home (though proxying with one Xeno stash instead of a Rainbow...).


19) Joe: Build B2 Joe
	ZackStack: I know what you mean about interesting!  This is my favorite Icehouse game and it got even better now that I'm playing the build tech right.
	ZackStack: Good luck with any table top play too!  I hope the colors don't end up confusing anyone too much.  Also, there is a three player unrated game waiting on the challenge board if you really want to break your brain (I've never played with more than two players...)

20) ZackStack: Move G1 Sunshine Joe

21) Joe: Trade Y3 R3 Prinsh

22) ZackStack: Build G1 Joe

23) Joe: Build B2 Joe
	ZackStack: Did you get a chance to play tabletop yesterday?
	Joe: Nope... all my tabletop plays (also with other games) happen rather irregularly, as my wife is not that interested in gaming, maybe except Stone Age a couple of times, so I have to resort to scarce playing with my Dad and my brother, who live nearby... And I have a lot of work around the house ;) So sometimes I invite them both to help me out and after that we can play a game or two. But I plan to soon!

24) ZackStack: Build G2 Sunshine

25) Joe: Sacrifice R2 Prinsh
Attack G1 Joe
Attack G1 Joe
	ZackStack: I know the feeling... My wife loves Alhambra and Ingenious so I get to play plenty of those.  I do have a weekly game club, but I rarely have sucess bringing out the pyramids there.

26) ZackStack: Move G1 Sunshine Joe
Catastrophe Joe Green
	Joe: Whew... I fought! :)
	ZackStack: Indeed.  I wondered how long until you zapped those guys... now to learn about catastrophes!

	Joe: Ah, yes. Now I know the effect ;)
