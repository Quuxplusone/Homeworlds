Homeworlds Online (SDG# 25450)
Started: 2014.2.26, Ended: 2014.3.9
Participants: Laurie_Menke (S), Otts (N)
Winner: Otts

1) Otts: Homeworld B2 Y1 G3
	Laurie_Menke: Thanks for the challenge, Alex!  Have fun!  (For starters, you'll want to build a homeworld with any two colors except green, and then build a large green ship.)

2) Laurie_Menke: Homeworld Y3 B1 G3

3) Otts: Build G1 Otts
	Laurie_Menke: The second move has no choice involved...we each have only one thing we can do:  build a small green.  After that, the choices start to open up.  :o)
	Otts: Ok, I think I've got a grasp of it here!  But...just to be (overly) technical and make sure I'm clear, before building that little green I could still have a few moves: pass, sacrifice my g3, or trade my g3 for another color.  I couldn't move it out because I wouldn't have any ships in my homeworld.  Granted none of those make sense, but I want to be sure I've got my head around it properly!

4) Laurie_Menke: Build G1 Laurie_menke

5) Otts: Discover G1 Otts B3 Beagle
	Laurie_Menke: It is true that you could pass or trade it for another color.  Good thinking!  :o)  You couldn't sacrifice it because that would leave your homeworld empty and end the game.

6) Laurie_Menke: Trade G1 Y1 Laurie_menke

7) Otts: Build G1 Otts

8) Laurie_Menke: Build Y1 Laurie_menke

9) Otts: Build G1 Beagle

10) Laurie_Menke: Build G2 Laurie_menke

11) Otts: Sacrifice G3 Otts
Build G2 Beagle
Build G2 Otts
Build G3 Otts
	Laurie_Menke: One thing you want to look out for is taking the last of any size.  When you took the last small green, I was able to get a medium green.  It was basically like you lost a turn, because I got 2 points of green power in one turn and those same two points of green power took you two turns.  It's not really avoidable a lot of the time, but it's something to watch for.  And BTW... you're doing well so far!
	Laurie_Menke: P.S.  I was safe taking the last yellow earlier because you didn't have the ability to grow yellow.
	Otts: Damn.  The learning curve is steep here, but I'm working my way through it.  I'm already finding holes in things I was thinking were solid yesterday.  I see now I'm frozen out of yellow ships for the time being.  You sly fox, I'll remember that.  ;)

12) Laurie_Menke: Sacrifice G3 Laurie_menke
Build G3 Laurie_menke
Build G3 Laurie_menke
Pass

13) Otts: Trade G3 Y3 Otts
	Laurie_Menke: Yes, the learning curve is extremely steep for this game.  But it's worth the time and effort.  And you are doing well!  That last move was a nice move!  That is called the "factory" move.  It's a great way to speed up production, but you have to be careful not to set yourself up for destruction...which you have done!  Nice job!

	Laurie_Menke: Oops!  Not sure why that posted twice...

14) Laurie_Menke: Discover Y1 Laurie_menke B2 Blue
	Laurie_Menke: LOL!  I don't know why I did that that way.  I could have just grown the green the regular way.  ::sigh::
	Otts: I realized its much tougher to learn this game when trying to learn other pyramid games at the same time.  Since they all have different trade mechanisms, I've had a little trouble connecting all the pips...er, dots, but I think I'm there now.  The thing that messed me up was thinking that when you trade, if your size ship is not available, you just take the next size up.  Well, that's not the case, so then I was thinking that I was frozen out of yellow ships, and even said so yesterday.  However, I just realized that I could swap my G3 for a Y3.  Gotta watch this game carefully!!

15) Otts: Sacrifice Y3 Otts
Discover G2 Otts Y3 I_hope
Discover G2 I_hope Y2 This_works
Move G2 This_works Laurie_menke
Catastrophe Laurie_menke G
	Laurie_Menke: Yep...there are always more options than appear on the surface.  :o)  And I know what you mean about learning multiple pyramid games at once!

16) Laurie_Menke: Discover Y1 Blue R3 Red

17) Otts: Sacrifice G2 Beagle
Build G2 Otts
Build G2 Otts
	Laurie_Menke: A well-executed move!  And it may pay off.  But it left your homeworld very weak.  We'll have to see how this pans out.  :o)

18) Laurie_Menke: Move Y1 Red Otts

19) Otts: Trade G2 R2 Otts
	Otts: Thanks! I'm not completely sure how the attacking works, so I'm interested to see how this ends up as well!
	Laurie_Menke: I'm not actually attacking.  I'm just protecting myself against an attack from you.  ;o)  In general, it takes two moves to attack--one to move into the same star system, and the other to turn an opponent's equal or smaller sized ship into your own ship (assuming you have accessto red).

20) Laurie_Menke: Discover Y1 Otts G3 Green
	Laurie_Menke: I should be nice and warn you that you are in imminent danger.  ;o)
	Otts: Hmmm...I sure do appreciate the courtesy...But I honestly can't figure out how.  There are no little greens you can trade your little yellow for, so I'm thinking I'm safe from catastrophe...Can you use the build technology off my green ships?  In any event, I was planning on switching a G2 to a R2, so that's what I guess I'm going to roll with...

21) Otts: Move R2 Otts Green
	Laurie_Menke: Ah, you are right...no little greens.  ::sigh::  And now i have to retreat.  ::double sigh::  You are doing very well!

22) Laurie_Menke: Discover Y1 Green G2 G2

23) Otts: Trade G2 Y2 Otts

24) Laurie_Menke: Move Y1 G2 Laurie_menke

25) Otts: Sacrifice Y2 Otts
Discover R2 Green G2 Sativa
Move R2 Sativa Laurie_menke

26) Laurie_Menke: Discover Y1 Laurie_menke G2 Ack

27) Otts: Attack Y1 Laurie_menke

	Otts: Well thanky!  I'm thinking I may have gotten lucky while your guard was down playing a newbie, but I'll take the compliment!  I do believe a rematch be a fair proposition!
