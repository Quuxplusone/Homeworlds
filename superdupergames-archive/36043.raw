Homeworlds Online (SDG# 36043)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2020.3.6, Ended: 2020.5.5
Participants: capi3101 (S), akuden (W), eliscinsky (N), pedrop (E)
Winner: capi3101

1) eliscinsky: Homeworld R1 B2 G3
	eliscinsky: Greetings Captains! I've never played more than Binary HW.  This should be fun!

2) pedrop: Homeworld Y3 B1 G3
	capi3101: It has indeed been many a year since I played multi-player...and never with four. Should be interesting. Best of luck to all of you.

3) capi3101: Homeworld B2 G3 Y3
	pedrop: Yeh. I have played it also like 10 years ago...:) I'm interested if my brain will explode... ;) It is good and evil variant somewhere? Where I can find if I'm good or evil?

4) akuden: Homeworld Y2 B3 G3
	capi3101: The tough choice goes to akuden...which of the rest of us is he directly adjacent to...
	eliscinsky: I don't think (see where) SDG can do G vs. E.  So my understanding is that this is a "Last player standing" game.  GL 2 all!
	eliscinsky: The only option available in the challenge screen is for ... Sinister -> This variant is a 3-4 player alternative to the default "Last Man Standing" end-of-game condition. Here, the player that eliminates the player to his left is victorious.
 
Since I didn't see that option selected for this game, it is by default a "Last Man Standing" end-of-game condition.
	capi3101: Translation: we are all either for good or for awesome...

5) eliscinsky: Build G1 Eliscinsky
	akuden: GL everyone! This is my second game and with 4 players. IÂ’m looking forward to it.

(I can build yellow, red or blue, or I can swap for a green. Building blue would be dumb of me right now. Even discovering a new system would require me to utilize a small. That's my train of thought anyway).
	capi3101: Well, I do have one other choice. But I don't like it.

	eliscinsky: Just a curiosity ... where does everyone call home?
I'm in Maryland, USA
	capi3101: Oklahoma, USA
	eliscinsky: Pedrop, I need an explanation why we shouldn't force your surrender? This is the 3rd time you've been up for surrender. What gives?
 
I thought when we all signed up for this game we'd be active. We've been more than understanding. 3 times you've gone past your timeout. It's like you've disappeared. 
	eliscinsky: I'll wait until his listing above shows -24h / -1d, then ....
	capi3101: I'm not for forcing a surrender. That said, were one of y'all to press the button, would the rest of us be able to continue play? I've never done a four-player game in this format before; I don't know what would happen.
	eliscinsky: I agree forcing a surrender is not my 1st option, however pedrop has done this 3 times now. I myself have been in situations where SDG was not emailing me when it was my turn. That is why I took it upon myself to check on my current games, which is easily done in the "My SDG" (profile area).
 
I'm all for giving a player enough time to consider all their options, but there is a reason for time limits. While I don't fancy baseball there is a "3 strikes and you're out" rule. If pedrop were to at least post that he's tied up for x period of time I'd have no problem waiting.  Even when I've had days to make my next move if something was going to hold me up I'd say something.
 
As for FS / TG, considering the [button] options are ...
1) Force Surrender (rated)
and
2) Terminate Game (unrated)
 
I would assume the 1st option would only eliminate the single player, return that players ships and or empty stars to the bank, and allow the rest to continue. However this is also my 1st multi-player game.

71) capi3101: Build G2 Gimel
	pedrop: Sorry, but I had more important things to do. Now I have 1h, let me make mare next move, after that if I won't be avaible - feel free to kick out me from this - game if it will not break it. I will be moving in future, but sometime I need more time. Sorry, again.

	capi3101: Okay, so going through the rules, I have to reveal whether I am for good or for awesome. How exactly do I find that out?
 
I was under the impression that pedrop's ships became mine automatically; after reviewing the rules, that's not the case - they'll stay on the board to be captured/destroyed. Makes sense. They'll still contribute to a drain on the economy.
	eliscinsky: How is it my turn now? In all previous moves, akuden moves after capi3101.
	eliscinsky: That is West moves after South. Could it be a flaw in the program? Should I (North) and capi3101 (South) both pass to give akuden (West) the next move? 
	eliscinsky: It's also weird, but on "My SDG" page, this game no longer shows me as a player, but it did before pedrop was eliminated.
	eliscinsky: Capi3101 I don't think Good vs. Evil is relevant on SDG. I believe it's a One vs. Many scenario.
	eliscinsky: capi3101 & akuden, I've asked someone I consider a master HW's player, and his take is ... 
 
"ON SDG, there are two ways to play Homeworlds with more than two players. The default is "Last captain standing" where the last player with a homeworld wins. The other way is "Sinister," in which you win if you eliminate the player on your left (resignation doesn't count as elimination, annoyingly). The "Good vs Evil" rules are not implemented on SDG.
 
You're right that the West player should have the next move after South, even after a player elimination. If you want to play it honest, you and capi3101 should pass so that akuden gets their turn in proper order."
 
As I was already considering a "pass", I just wanted to get another (expert) opinion.  With that said ... I pass.

Lot of that stuff is from the early 2000s. Funny as hell, even now. The reference I meade is specifically from the first of the Strong Bad e-mails, entitled "Some Kinda Robot", which is really not as funny as some of the later stuff. 
 
And now, back to your regularly scheduled game already in progress.

	capi3101: Problem with doomsday machines is that they're intended to work with just one opponent. Unleashing one in a 3+ player game costs a lot of resources...
	capi3101: Just noting that I have a fairly big material disadvantage at the moment.

158) akuden: Build Y3 Gimel
	akuden: Best of luck to you as well, Capi. You do have a pretty good shot even with the disadvantage, as you may have noticed, I don't have a good grasp at the strategy of this game as of yet. 
	eliscinsky: Capi, I look forward to a future match.  Would also like to get another "Last Captain Standing", or even a "Sinister", game going.  PM me sometime when you're ready.
 
Akuden, and Pedrop, are you interested in a rematch in the future?

	capi3101: I can't tell if I have time to pull this out or not. Going to try.

	eliscinsky: Akuden: Attacks work in a number of different scenarios.  1st you do need a red (attack economy) somewhere on the board. 2nd you can only attack an equal or smaller ship.  So here are a couple scenarios that might help your understanding. (without helping you with the game)
 
1) There is a Y3 Star, and you have a B1 there, and your opponent has a G1 & Y2 there.  If you have a R1 somewhere else you can sacrifice your R1 elsewhere and attack the G1, but not the Y2. (Same or smaller)
 
2) There is a Y3 Star, and you have a B2 there, and your opponent has a G1 & Y2 there.  If you have a R2 somewhere else you can sacrifice your R2 elsewhere and attack either or both G1 and Y2. (Same or smaller)
 
3) There is a Y3 Star, and you have a R1 there, and your opponent has a G1 & Y2 there.  You can attack the G1, but not the Y2. (Same or smaller, and your red is in the same system)
 
4) There is a Y3 Star, and you have a R2 there, and your opponent has a G1 & Y2 there.  You can attack either G1 or Y2, but not both at the same time (it would take 2 moves). Unless you sacrifice a R2 elsewhere first.  (You cannot sacrifice this R2 as it needs to be there for the attack)
 
Conclusion: Using the power of Red / Attack by way of proximity or sacrifice;
3 pips ships can attack 1, 2, or 3 pip ships
2 pips ships can attack 1, or 2 pip ships
1 pip ships can attack 1 pip ships

	akuden: Awesome! Thanks eliscinsky! That makes sense! 
	capi3101: Well, that'll do it. If y'all want a rematch, just say the word.
	eliscinsky: Yes, yes Please
	eliscinsky: Yes please on the rematch! Same "Last Captain standing" or "Sinister" variant?  
	capi3101: Good with either.
	eliscinsky: I put up a Sinister, or one of you can put up a default game that I'll join. :)
	capi3101: I'm in.
