	rootbier: so what have you learned already in this game? if you are building your home system second - better not to use the same color small star (there are other ways around this but they make other problems).
	MagicJohn: I am a big fan of Joni Mitchell's "Blue Album" but this is ridiculous. You obtained access to large ships very quickly.  By the time I saw it coming there was little I could do in terms of quick response. Maybe I should have tried to build yellow as an alternative rout to larger ships?  I'm still not sure if I should trade my G3 for a blue. I suspect that I need to try to forestall a blue catastrophe in my home system.     

18) MagicJohn: Build G1 Mauisands
	rootbier: you could have tried to grab yellow but you couldn't really have blocked me out of it - especially not since it was "trade" ships i was filling up on. once someone has a level two ship it becomes much harder to lock them out of a color.

	MagicJohn: My last few moves have been either defensive or pointless, but I wanted to see how the attack developed. Thanks for the game. MJ  
	rootbier: boo. see it through. i've been known to make some bonehead mistakes at crucial moments.
	MagicJohn: If I can get Aaron to undo my resignation I'll give it a shot.
	MagicJohn: Aaron, apparently rootbier thinks I should blunder through to the very end of this game. I'm always up for a good humiliation, so if you can rewind this mess please do.  Thanks (I think) MagicJohn 
	rootbier: no no. not worth bothering someone else about. just start a new one.
