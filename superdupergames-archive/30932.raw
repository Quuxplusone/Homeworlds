	mi_spero: gg
	Draw5PlayAll: ???
	mi_spero: I have little idea how to play the early game, less idea how to play the mid game, and at this stage of the game am doing little better than moving at random. Given that, I see little reason to continue, assuming that for any G(H,n)=[(1v0)^~(1^0)] where G is the result (win or loss) of the Homeworlds game H at move n, G(H,n) approaches 0 or 1 for some sufficiently large n. In other words, iff there is always a winner. If there is not always a winner, it grows more complicated, but if there is a winner, then eventually you would have been said winner. So because I can surmise the end, there is no need to continue.
	Draw5PlayAll: Tip: Especially with more players, explore multiple systems. I like to send a green to a blue system and a blue to a green system to provide balance and kick start the development.
	Draw5PlayAll: Several no winner situations can arise. For instance, all blue and yellow could be wiped out.
