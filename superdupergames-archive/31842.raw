Catastrophe Wil Blue
	Felix: Ah, it worked! I totally messed up and then totally forgot to catastrophe.
	Felix: That's what I get for being overeager.
	Draw5PlayAll: At least wil cannot prevent it next turn.

	wil: Doomsday machine...Exactly how I lost to Andy last night.. Nice 
	Felix: Good game though! Did you play against Andy Looney last night?  Cool!
	Felix: I'd love to get the chance to play against him.
	wil: Ya gotta catch him...and get that medal!
	Felix: How did you play him? In person, or on here?
	wil: I met Andy before I met homeworlds...  we play regularly, friend and neighbor.
	wil: He, like most of us, get driven crazy by the format of the ships in the blocks and the orientation of the blocks in relation to connection between star systems..
	wil: and since he is now giving away medals for beating him, I suspect he won't be playing the medal competition games online even if an improved system is built....but who knows...
	Felix: Ah, very cool that you are friends and neighbors! I have played far more games on here than with actual pyramids, so I've gotten used to the format, but I definitely prefer the real deal!
	Draw5PlayAll: Yeah, I am not sure if there is an easy way to make the formatting better... the blocks and the 5x5 grids are just so much easier to code...
	wil: I have friends playing with the virtual reality, might be we will be able to play live games moving pieces around space.
	Draw5PlayAll: That seems a bit of a stretch. But tell me when I can say "Computer, freeze program!" and have it work.
	Draw5PlayAll: And about the format... I got my Homeworlds start from here... I have played fewer than a dozen IRL games.
