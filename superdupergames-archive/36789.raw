	Babamots: I just looked at your profile page and saw that lots of games are listed as "Recently completed." I think that means that you don't look at your own profile page often, is that correct? I refresh my profile page to see which games I need to move in. Do you just use the links from emails?
	deanthebean: I don't think so. I have email notifications turned off. Is there some way to clear the "recently completed games" list?

32) Babamots: Discover B2 Bajor G3 Zakdorn
	Draw5PlayAll: You just go to the game and if it is finished it is removed from the list.
