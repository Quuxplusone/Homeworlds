	dsheldon: The best choice of several bad options...
	zoltar: Yep, and the one that holds out the longest, I think.  And my response is the most agressive reply I can find, as well.

47) zoltar: Move G3 Shortbus Sigh
	dsheldon: I'm trying to do this and it's not working:
 
s y3 dsheldon
m g2 sigh dsheldon
m r1 sigh shortbus
m r2 sigh shortbus
c shortbus r
 
It gives the error "the dsheldon system does not exist."  I wonder if this is a failure to implement the "temporarily leaving your homeworld" rule.
	zoltar: I think that the rule doesn't work, as your homeworld disappears before the other ship returns to it. I don't think the game will let you temporarily abandon your homeworld without destroying it.
	dsheldon: Well, it is a pretty extreme action.  It also means I'm left without large ships and in a poor position to ever get one again.  I'm considering just resigning.  It's been pretty clear for most of the game that I will be defeated.
	Aaron: I was sure that this had been tested in the past and worked fine.  I will need to run some tests.  The orderset looks fine though.  I'm going to freeze the clock.  I have a paper due tomorrow but I hope to have a little time over the weekend to catch up a little bit and will look then.  Thanks for your patience.
	dsheldon: That sounds just fab.  Thanks for the quick response.
	zoltar: Cool.  We can wait and see what happens.  In the meantime, if you want to start another game, that's fine with me.  You're toast in this one no matter what, I think, but this way Aaron can fix the problem with the program in general.
	Aaron: "Fixed."  I'm very sorry for the extreme delay.  Please see the forums for additional comments regarding this situation.
	zoltar: Whew Who!

48) dsheldon: Trade G2 B2 Dsheldon
	dsheldon: I have no recollection of what I was doing, so I just pasted my old command in from previous comments.  It worked!  Yeah!

	dsheldon: Well, here goes my last move...

	zoltar: Ok, the game will let me move my blue ship in, but it won't let me blow up the dsheldon homeworld.  I suppose this move will do, unless Aaron's fix prevents catastrophes from ever occurring in a homeworld, which would make for an interesting handicap actually...
	dsheldon: Well, I must say that I'm quite glad I didn't resign then because I'm always glad to help find bugs.
 
Still, I'm starting to feel bad for the rest of the ladder participants.
	Aaron: Can you copy and paste the top part of the error screen please?  Sorry for the trouble.  I was afraid I would blow something up.  Homeworlds is a complex beast.
	zoltar: Sure: let's see, I can undo my move, and then redo it with the catastrophe to get the white screen of death, and I'll paste that in for you.
	zoltar: System error

	zoltar: Hey, it worked. The binary star system blew up instead of the program this time!  Cool.  GG.
