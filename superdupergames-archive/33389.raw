	shoejitsu: weird, i didnt see an email for it being my turn... sorry for the wait

	Babamots: Tournament games are supposed to use 2/2/7 hard time. I can't see what the time settings are for this game, but since more than a week has passed without a move, the settings must be different from tournament regulation. As it turned out, the result of this game could not affect tournament bracket seeding, and the next phase of the tournament is already well underway. For completeness, I'm going to record that ts52 won this game by timeout.
	ts52: Huh, I must've missed setting hard time. Sorry about that. I'll force the termination of this game.
