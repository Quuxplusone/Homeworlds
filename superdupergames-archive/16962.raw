	rootbier: we all were at some point. feel free to ask questions. right now - you're in a little trouble because i am already going to mostly lock you out of yellow. and from there it gets ugly. you could do the same to me with blue - but blue isn't nearly as valuable as yellow.
	rootbier: you understand that you can't build another blue there right now ... i'd be able to call catastrophe and wipe them all out. so you need to move at least once (like i just did) before building more blue. you can build green but that doesn't get you to larger ships so fast. you can't really just trade your big to yellow - cuz then you'll have no green... the whole game is baby steps :)
 
except for sacrifices :D

12) Lurch: Build B2 Alpha
	Lurch: My plan is to build it and trade it before you could call a catastrophe :)
	rootbier: it doesn't work that way. i can call it right now and you lose all your blue - including your star. you can undo or i can teach you the painful lesson.
	rootbier: ;)
	Lurch: I guess I don't understand.  I can change my ship in one move but I don't see how you can get a blue into my home world in one move.  You still need to discover a size 2 star, move to my home world and build or trade to get a blue ship.
	rootbier: I don't need to be there. I don't need to be the CAUSE of the overpopulation. I just need to see that there are four of the same color in a system and put in the command. Means you even have to control your own population/growth.
 
I made a similar mistake when I was starting and paid dearly for it. 
	Lurch: dough, I see what you mean now.

	Lurch: Thanks, I think that my take away from this game is not to give up a size 3 ship in your homeworld for early gains.
	rootbier: Yeah. Having a three at home is pretty crucial. If I have to go without for a turn -- okay I will -- but unless I have LOTS of yellow to spare I will always (try to) have a big ship within one easy step of home. Blah blah and blah.
 
And watch what you lose on cats - you may hurt the other guy bad (you did) - but you can easily end up screwing yourself over in the process (you did).
