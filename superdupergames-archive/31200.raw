1) Babamots: Homeworld B3 R1 G3

	Ausmuh: I have no place to enter commands from my screen. o.O  Never ran into this problem before. :)
	Babamots: I had my loyalists on your planet sabotage your interstellar transmitter. It's war. You do what you gotta do. ;-)
	Ausmuh: Haha, so that's what happened! Well done! I admit I never saw it coming.
	Draw5PlayAll: Who is playing this game?
	Babamots: It's Babamots and ausmuh.
	Ausmuh: OK, well I can't take a move, but maybe if the time runs out you can at least move up a rung?
	Babamots: Well yeah, but that's not very fair to you. I can wait. Let's get someone to sort this out.
	Babamots: I'll trying emailing Aaron. If that fails, I'll try Facebook and SDG PM. So many ways to bug people!
	Ausmuh: Haha, ok. Whatever is clever :)
	Babamots: Quick question: have you tried using a different browser?
	Ausmuh: I have tried a couple different ones to no avail :( chrome, slim jet (chrome), edge. I'll have to try Firefox. I can take turns in my other games so I don't know if that's the problem.
	Babamots: I haven't got an email response yet, so I tried Aaron on Facebook today. If we never hear back, whaddaya say we play an unranked game and the loser resigns this one?
	Ausmuh: I like it! Except I don't have a resign button either. Just the map. You'DE Welshman to start the clock, no bad feelings here. I'm still all for another game though :)
	Ausmuh: *you're welcome.    
 
Wow, autocorrect. Welshman....
	Babamots: But you can run out the clock, so we can still use this to update the ladder correctly. 
	Ausmuh: good point! :) 
	Babamots: Aaron hasn't checked his Facebook messages yet. Oh well. I promise not to disable your communications array the next time we meet.
	Ausmuh: Sounds good to me! The whole time this played out I couldn't help but think of SpaceBalls.
 
"The radar appears to be..."
"Jammed.... raspberry. There's only one man who would dare give me the raspberry! Babamots!!!"
	Babamots: Ausmuh. So at last we meet for the first time for the last time.
	Babamots: Looks like Aaron is active on the site. I should have sent him a PM first.
