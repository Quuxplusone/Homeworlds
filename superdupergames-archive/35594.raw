	Babamots: I was sorry to hear you're going through some tough times. I hope games are making things seem nicer!
	nycavri: Thanks -  much appreciated.  I'm doing OK and games (and gamers!) are always a pleasant distraction.
	nycavri: I would be slighty happier if I hadn't mae a mistake in this game around move 4 . . .

17) Babamots: Discover Y2 Babamots R3 Romulus

18) nycavri: Discover G1 Nycavri Y3 Deacon
	Babamots: I usually advise people not to use yellow in the home system. It can limit your chances to get yellow ships, and I consider yellow to be the key to victory.

19) Babamots: Build Y3 Babamots
	nycavri: I've been playing a long time, and that's a tip I've never heard before.    But io has certainly been key here (although perhaps exacerbated by the tiny universe I initiated . . .)

20) nycavri: Build R1 Nycavri

21) Babamots: Trade Y3 R3 Babamots
	Babamots: I can think of one argument in favor of having a yellow home star: if my opponent wants to catastrophe my yellow star, they'll need not only several yellow ships for destruction in the catastrophe but a yellow ship to sacrifice to get them all to my home at once. My opponent would have to have four correctly placed yellow ships. To catastrophe any other color, you usually need three ships of that color and one yellow. It's a little harder to assemble a fleet of four yellows than it is to assemble a fleet of three (for example) reds and one yellow.

22) nycavri: Move R1 Nycavri Deacon

23) Babamots: Build Y3 Babamots
	nycavri: Plenty to think about.  I really thing Homeworlds (not Zendo) is the pyramid killer app.

24) nycavri: Discover B1 Nycavri Y3 May
	Babamots: I agree. Homeworlds has more potential for widespread play than any other pyramid game.
