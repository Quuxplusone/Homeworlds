Homeworlds Online (SDG# 9340)
Variants: "Hard time"
Started: 2007.9.14, Ended: 2007.9.29
Participants: Visible (S), TwoShort (N)
Winner: TwoShort

1) TwoShort: Homeworld B3 R1 G3
TwoShort: [ajo] I flipped the players here; Visible started out with "Pass"

2) Visible: Homeworld Y2 B2 G3
Visible: Hey there. Feel like a rematch?
Visible: Heh. Couldn't decide on an opening, so I figured I'd find out if it lets you pass your first turn... =X

3) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

4) Visible: Build G1 Visible
TwoShort: Couldn't decide on an opening, or wanted to force another micro-universe game? :) Not that it matters, I think the microverse favors player 1 despite my screwing it up last time.
Visible: Didn't really want to force the same game. I just think it's the optimal response to your homeworld.
Visible: It puts the game on rails, as far as I can tell. Optimal or near-optimal play by both players results in victory for me.
Visible: I think. =P

5) TwoShort: Trade G1 Y1 Twoshort

6) Visible: Trade G1 R1 Visible
Visible: And honestly, I couldn't decide on an opening. Most of the possibilities are just... so... not good.

7) TwoShort: Build Y1 Twoshort
TwoShort: You may be right, I haven't given the micro-universe all that much thought. Out of curiosity, how much analysis are you basing your conclusion on?

8) Visible: Build G1 Visible
Visible: Not a great deal. If you run through our last game, though, you'll notice a LOT of cause and effect.
Visible: I think taking a yellow star instead of red may mess that up, for this game. I didn't give it much thought; just wanted to change it up.

TwoShort: As far as openings as first player, my only current debate is whether the blue should be a 2 or a 3 :) But I do think it's better to go first under the rules in use here.

9) TwoShort: Build Y1 Twoshort
Visible: Well, taking any single-pip first is probably a handicap. The 1r 3b 3g means that you'll almost always take -two- small pieces first.
TwoShort: I just wanted to make sure your answer was "mostly our last game" rather than "extensive computer modeling" :) The game is certainly constrained in this set up, but I think the last game is mostly down to one stupid move I made. Which I'll be happy to point out after I don't make it this time :)
Visible: Heh. Pretty sure it was when you moved your 1g into my homeworld without any way to make use of it. -_^

10) Visible: Build R1 Visible
Visible: Hmmm. Yeah... was afraid this would happen. Definately a mistake taking a yellow star.

11) TwoShort: Discover Y1 Twoshort Y2 Yolonda

12) Visible: Build R2 Visible

13) TwoShort: Build Y2 Twoshort

14) Visible: Discover R1 Visible Y3 Invisible
TwoShort: So have you played much Homeworlds off-line?

15) TwoShort: Discover Y2 Twoshort B2 Bluonia
Visible: None at all. Actually, our previous game was the first that I've completed. I've got one in progress which I started prior to that, though.

16) Visible: Discover R2 Visible Y3 Unvisible

17) TwoShort: Build Y3 Twoshort
Visible: This is absolutely bizarre.
TwoShort: Sigh. I was afraid it was your first game. I guess I'll blame your unconventional tactics for throwing me off :)

18) Visible: Sacrifice G3 Visible
Build R2 Invisible
Build R2 Unvisible
Build R3 Visible
Visible: Well, if it's any comfort, you seem to be stomping all over me this time around. ;)
Visible: This'll be my last move for this evening, incidentally.

19) TwoShort: Trade Y3 R3 Twoshort
TwoShort: Hmmm, I think I'll feel better if I crush you a half-dozen times or so. :) I mean, nothing personal, but I'm the highest rated Homeworlds player here. I'm supposed to be an unstoppable juggernaut; not get tripped up by first-timers who don't know enough to be intimidated ;) Seriously though, you're playing shockingly well for a newbie.

20) Visible: Move R1 Invisible Yolonda
Visible: Oh, I knew who you were when I joined the game. ;)
Visible: Was the whole reason I went with the aggressive strategy.
Visible: Anyway, you don't learn anything playing against newbs.

21) TwoShort: Move R3 Twoshort Yolonda

22) Visible: Move R2 Unvisible Bluonia
Visible: Good move.

23) TwoShort: Sacrifice R3 Yolonda
Attack R2N Bluonia
Attack R1N Yolonda
Pass
TwoShort: Well, I'm learning a lot, having never played a game with adjacent homeworlds before. The last one was exactly the sort of desperately constricted game I'd always assumed it would be, but this one is fascinating. It's too dangerous to build up the forces for a direct assault in one's own homeworld, so you have to also expand around the long way, making it like a normal 3-hop universe bent into a circle. Room to grow, but not to breathe.
Visible: I meant that I, as a newbie, wasn't going to learn much playing other newbies.
Visible: It has been an extremely interesting game.
Visible: I think same-size stars in your homeworld may be an extremely strong opening. It basically halves your initial movement costs, while doubling your initial movement options.
Visible: As you said, though, you do probably sacrifice breathing room.

24) Visible: Sacrifice G1 Visible
Build R3 Invisible
Visible: Ooooof. Not good.

25) TwoShort: Build Y3 Twoshort

26) Visible: Move R3 Invisible Bluonia

27) TwoShort: Discover R2 Bluonia G3 Threatamantic
TwoShort: So out of curiosity, where are you?
TwoShort: (I'm in Boulder, Colorado)
Visible: Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Visible: Boulder, eh? Starting to get cold over there, too?

28) Visible: Sacrifice R1 Visible
Attack Y2 Bluonia

29) TwoShort: Trade Y1 R1 Twoshort
Visible: =/

30) Visible: Move R2 Unvisible Yolonda

31) TwoShort: Discover R1 Yolonda B3 Bluestar

32) Visible: Trade R3 G3 Visible
Visible: WOW. I didn't think that was a great move, when I made it...
Visible: but... just WOW. talk about oversight. =X

33) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort
