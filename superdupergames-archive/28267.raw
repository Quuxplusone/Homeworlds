	Aristos: Signals reach Homeworld from a new star, but in the same language, indicating that at least one other star-faring people exists in the universe. Thus far, the language defies our efforts at translation.

	Aristos: Disaster! On entering a new system, something destabilized our ship. The final readings from the ship suggest that there was an overabundance of the red energy used in our splitter beams (used for peaceful mining purposes). Perhaps it was a triple star system?

	Aristos: Intrepid explorers report that they have found the homeworld of the aliens. It is a strange place with red and blue suns. Not like our friendly yellow star and its green companion. Initial photos stir xenophobia among the populace. The popular press dubs the red star "krypton" and warns of a race of supermen seeking to take us over. It seems unlikely that there can be peace between our species...
