	mjbuyck: I suppose not.
	maka: isn't there a way to ending the game without resigning? 
	zoltar: Hey guys, wait for someone's time to run out, and then the other person can end the game and choose to terminate it without rating, but I actually don't think 4-player games get rated anyway.  I resigned because we were down to 3 and the game had just started.  We can start another if you'd like.
	maka: ok. done
	Kermit: multiplayer games are not rated, unfortunately, as I win more of those than two player. sorry for my delay see the general forum.
