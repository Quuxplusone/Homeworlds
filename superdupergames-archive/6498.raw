Catastrophe Dsheldon Green
	clockwise: Your move actually makes this a little easier.
	dsheldon: I figured you'd either nuke my Y3 star, or switch your Y3 to an R3 and just take over everything.  At least this way you lose a ship in the process.
 
So I have one ship that can't move, and one small in my homeworld.  All I can do is make green ships and all the ones I'll make you can steal until there are four and all my forces die...
 
I've lost, do you want to play it through or should I just resign?

	clockwise: Actually, this way I get an extra g3 in the process, not that it really matters.
	clockwise: Thanks for the game!
	dsheldon: You're quite welcome.  Every time I lose I learn something.
 
I've been learning a lot lately...
