Participants: Chivenger (S), Felix (N)
Winner: Felix

1) Felix: Homeworld B2 Y3 G3
	Chivenger: homeworld G2S B1S

2) Chivenger: Homeworld G2 B1 Y3
	Chivenger: First game here and of Homeworlds. Be gentle please. 


3) Felix: Build G1 Felix

4) Chivenger: Build Y1 Chivenger
	Felix: No worries! I'm happy to help you learn. But the best way to learn is to lose a bunch of games and learn from mistakes! Let me know if you have any questions or want any tips along the way though.

5) Felix: Trade G1 B1 Felix
	Chivenger: So my Green only lets me build Yellow despite having Blue and Green in my Homeworld?


6) Chivenger: Pass
	Felix: That's correct. You have to already have a ship of a color in a system before you can build that color.
	Chivenger: So I don't "own" the ships in my galaxy to discover a new planet. Can you do one so I can see how that is supposed to work?

	Chivenger: And I can't trade the 3Y for a 3G? 

7) Felix: Pass
	Felix: Just type "discover y1 [star color/size] [star name]" 
So "discover y1 g3 DeathStar" for instance.

8) Chivenger: Discover Y1 Chivenger G3 Deathstar

9) Felix: B G1 Felix

10) Chivenger: Trade Y3 G3 Chivenger

11) Felix: Trade G1 Y1 Felix
	Chivenger: Ooh. Got that command right in the first try. 

12) Chivenger: Build G1 Chivenger
	Felix: Well done! :)

13) Felix: Build Y1 Felix

14) Chivenger: Build Y2 Deathstar

15) Felix: Discover Y1 Felix G1 Out

16) Chivenger: Trade G1 R1 Chivenger

17) Felix: Build Y2 Out

18) Chivenger: Move Y2 Deathstar Chivenger
	Chivenger: Added a second Y2 and that makes three your 1Y makes four and bad things happen

	Felix: That's exactly right. You're catching on :)

19) Felix: Build B1 Felix

20) Chivenger: Trade Y2 R2 Chivenger

21) Felix: Move Y1 Out Felix

22) Chivenger: Trade R2 Y2 Chivenger
	Chivenger: And I am seeing why Andy Looney likes this game so much. There is a LOT going on. 

23) Felix: Trade Y1 R1 Felix
	Felix: You haven't seen anything yet! And piece of advice... it's not usually beneficial to trade a color out of your system. Now you don't have yellow in your home system anymore, which is dangerous

	Chivenger: Yeah. Noticed that and yeah gave up a couple ships behind now.

24) Chivenger: Build Y1 Chivenger

25) Felix: Trade B1 R1 Felix

26) Chivenger: Build R2 Chivenger
	Chivenger: So the blue in my homeworld doesn't count to build a blue? 
	Felix: Nope. You must already have a ship of a certain color in order to build another.

27) Felix: Build Y2 Out

28) Chivenger: Build Y3 Deathstar

29) Felix: Move R1 Felix Out

30) Chivenger: Move R2 Chivenger Deathstar

31) Felix: M Y2 Out Deathstar

32) Chivenger: Move Y3 Deathstar Out

33) Felix: S R1 Out
A R2 Deathstar

34) Chivenger: Build R1 Chivenger

35) Felix: Attack Y1 Deathstar
	Chivenger: Almost missed that for an easy attack. That would have been a Catastrophe, literally.

36) Chivenger: Sacrifice R1 Chivenger
Attack Y2N Out
	Felix: Good catch!
	Chivenger: So you sacrifice the R1 and that lets you flip my R2? New lesson.

37) Felix: Move Y1 Deathstar Chivenger
	Felix: Yep. It's one of the sneaky moves you can do in this. I'm hoping you will learn something things in this game!

38) Chivenger: Sacrifice Y2 Chivenger
Move Y3 Out Deathstar
Move R1 Chivenger Deathstar

39) Felix: Attack R1 Deathstar
	Chivenger: Ah Ha. Need a ship in the system to do that. Okay. What's next Obi-Won?

40) Chivenger: Pass
	Felix: I dunno. We'll see what kinds of situations pop up!

41) Felix: Sacrifice Y1 Chivenger
Pass
	Chivenger: Not ideal. But it keeps the Catastrophe off the board. 

42) Chivenger: Build Y1 Out
	Chivenger: The Y3 blunts the attack on R1, right?
	Felix: No, I'm afraid not. I can still attack your r1, but I just can't attack your y3

43) Felix: Move R2 Deathstar Out
	Chivenger: So at this point I feel I am pretty far behind and no way to recover. Is there a point to continue this? Any suggestions?

44) Chivenger: Move Y3 Deathstar Chivenger

45) Felix: Build Y2 Deathstar
	Felix: It is not as bad as you think. I'd try to trade for a red ship so you can use your y3 to regain some ships. I will take a useless turn to keep this going :)

46) Chivenger: Sacrifice Y2 Out
Move Y1 Out Deathstar
Move Y1 Chivenger Deathstar
Catastrophe Deathstar Yellow
	Chivenger: Okay. Got in a couple live games over thr weekend. If you have a winning shot take it. We can just play again.

	Chivenger: Thanks. A friend of mine and I got in some live games at a con over the weekend and we have been playing another game here. It's a fun damn game. I am learning defense but have to learn to layer my offense better. 

52) Chivenger: Trade Y1 R1 Chivenger

53) Felix: Trade B2 Y2 Out
	Felix: It definitely takes a while to grasp offense. It's all about expanding your fleet and diversifying colors as much as possible so you have more attack options

84) Chivenger: Sacrifice Y2 Chivenger
Move R3 Out Rom
Move G3 Chivenger Rom
	Felix: No problem! I'm glad you're learning things. I think you can see that controlling blue can become very important.
	Chivenger: Absolutely. Controlling any color can be critical if you can monopolize it. 

85) Felix: Sacrifice R2 Felix
Attack R3 Rom
Attack G3 Rom
	Felix: Definitely, but blue especially, since without blue, you can't trade and it's very hard to expand or diversify

	Felix: Oops! Good thought, but sacrificing a red 2 allows for multiple attacks!
	Chivenger: No, I saw that. I was out of good options. So it was a matter of the least bad options.I think at this point this one has gotten out of hand. If you want another game, send a challenge. But with the holiday weekend, it may take some time to get on track. 

	Felix: No worries. I'm about to have a baby and move house, so I'm tied up now anyway. But thanks for the game!
