	AstroPrincess: You're right about the Sacrifice rules. We have been doing it wrong, but I think it was about even because I don't think we were using the ability of the sacrificed ship in a system in which we didn't already have that ability

18) moverman: Trade R2 Y2 Moverman
	moverman: I think our mistaken approach was quite a bit more powerful - being able to do several different things with the same ship, is much stronger: move, trade, attack, with one ship, for example. But still: the rule was the same for both of us, so it all works out in the wash. I think the real rule makes the strategy a bit more interesting.
