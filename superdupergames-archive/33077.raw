	dragon76n: Hello redsang, 
I hope you enjoy the game. I've played a few times, both online and in person, but not a lot. Is this your first time playing Homeworlds at all, or just first time playing it on SDG? Either way, as long as you keep playing, I'm willing to answer your questions about the game.

	redsang: Have I just messed up by not starting with a blue?

7) dragon76n: B Y1 Dragon76n

8) redsang: Discover G1 Redsang B3 Tom
	dragon76n: Well, based on some of the things I've read, yellow, blue, and green give you a better start, but at least you can go out and discover a blue star. 
	dragon76n: I think yellow is the worst color to begin without, since you can't move to discover anything without yellow.

10) redsang: Trade G1 R1 Tom

11) dragon76n: Build Y2 Gretwo

12) redsang: Build G1 Redsang

14) redsang: Move G1 Redsang Tom

15) dragon76n: Trade Y2 R2 Tom
	redsang: Just lost the other game I was playing. There's still so much about the mechanics I don't get.
	Draw5PlayAll: @dragon76n I think blue is the second worst to start without (you absolutely must have green to do anything useful). I use B3R1 with a G3 ship, and trade my built G1 for a Y1 to do exploring. But without blue it becomes more risky to obtain blue ships (it takes longer and your homeworld is relatively safe early on).

16) redsang: Trade G1 B1 Tom

17) dragon76n: A R1 Tom
	redsang: It seems like I have inadvertently gotten my ships stuck at Tom. Not really sure what tot do here.
	dragon76n: IÂ’ll put them back to work. ;)

	dragon76n: Hi... 
	dragon76n: Hello redsang... it looks like you've abandoned the game. 
	Draw5PlayAll: I think so too.
