Homeworlds Online (SDG# 21193)
Started: 2011.11.20, Ended: 2011.12.4
Participants: ringebri (S), MagicJohn (N)
Winner: MagicJohn

1) MagicJohn: Homeworld R1 B2 G3
	MagicJohn: According to the wiki, green, blue and yellow are the most important beginning colors although red home stars are gaining in popularity. Check out the rules and wiki for suggestions.

2) ringebri: Homeworld G1 Y3 B3
	ringebri: what's the syntax for my first commands. Please give examples.
	MagicJohn: first the command "homeworld" then whatchawanna do ei "homeworld" "g1" (small green star) "y3" (large yellow star) and "b3" (large blue ship). The first command would look like "homeworld g1 y3 b3"  see the middle top of the page for commands....   

3) MagicJohn: Build G1 Magicjohn
	ringebri: ok. since I still don't know what I'm doing, I put your example into the command box.
	MagicJohn: Next, it seems that the objective is to build big (#3) ships. Good players can control the stash by building ships or discovering new stars, each of which depletes the stash. Abandoning a system put that star back in the stash....
	MagicJohn: The color green is used to build. You can only build a color of ship that you already own in that star system. I own a green ship sooo..... "build G1 magicjohn" is my next command.

4) ringebri: Build B1 Ringebri
	MagicJohn: You own a blue ship, so "build b1 ringebri" is your next move. You could also "trade" your b3 for another large ship but that would be wasting a turn. You could "discover" but that would abandon your homeworld and you would imediately lose the game..... 
	MagicJohn: This is like an opening in chess. You try to set yourself up in a powerful position for a mid-game attack.

5) MagicJohn: Build G1 Magicjohn
	ringebri: what if I wanted a red ship? or a blue2 ship?
	MagicJohn: To get a red ship you would have to trade in (blue color available so trading is OK)one of your other ships. When you build, you always get the smallest ship from the stash in the color you want. Therefore, you must wait for all of the #1 ships to be in play or trade another #2 ship for it.
	MagicJohn: Did that make sense or should I rephrase?

6) ringebri: Build B1 Ringebri
	MagicJohn: By building a g1 I limited your access to green. Now the only way you can get one (stash being what it is at present) is to trade in your b3 ship. No big deal now but it could be problematic later on.
	MagicJohn: Also I would NEVER make that move later in the game because you could move another green ship into my system and blow up (catastrophe) all of the green ships or stars in the system.
	MagicJohn: Your next move could be to build another blue ship, discover a new star system, or trade for another color of ship. You can trade a #3 for a #3 of a different color or your #1 for a #1 of a different color.
	MagicJohn: You would have to "discover" a #2 sized star system (of whatever color) because you can only travel to stars of a different size than the one you are traveling from.

7) MagicJohn: Trade G1 Y1 Magicjohn

8) ringebri: Discover B1 Ringebri R2 Vorkin
	MagicJohn: Now I need to move some ships so I don't "catastrophe" myself. To do that, I need access to yellow. Hence the trade.  You will need to "discover" or "trade" for the same reason. The color of your new star will dictate whether you can "travel/move" (yellow) or build (green).
	MagicJohn: You have yellow technology already (your #3 star),so you can "discover" this turn. Just don't build another blue ship in your system just now. 
	ringebri: because that would "overpopulate" my homeworld, right?

9) MagicJohn: Discover G1 Magicjohn Y3 Overthemoon
	ringebri: fire hydrant fire hydrant!
	MagicJohn: Cute..... Fortunately not as bad as Webster's mutt.
Yes. Four of one color of anything (stars and ships combined) equals a catastrophe. Moving a ship into your opponent's to create a catastrophe is a major strategy towards winning the game. 

10) ringebri: Trade B1 R1 Ringebri

11) MagicJohn: Build G1 Magicjohn

12) ringebri: Build B1 Ringebri
	MagicJohn: My plan is to build a couple more greens then sacrifice my g3. That lets me build 3 new ships, so I could get two g2's and a g3, which would be a profitable building move.

13) MagicJohn: Build G2 Overthemoon

14) ringebri: Trade B3 Y3 Ringebri
	MagicJohn: You can continue to push your blue technology but eventually use it to achieve some yellow or green. Remember that #3 ships = power.  
	MagicJohn: Right now, you would not want to discover/create a g3 star system. Then when I sacrifice I would get two g3's and a g2 instead or vise-versa.
	MagicJohn: If you had a b2 and travel technology in vorkin, you could have foiled my plan. Can you see how?

15) MagicJohn: Sacrifice G3 Magicjohn
Build G2 Overthemoon
Build G2 Magicjohn
Build G3 Magicjohn
	MagicJohn: I'm trying to be a good teacher. So, grasshopper, do you see how my plan might have been foiled?

16) ringebri: Trade Y3 G3 Ringebri
	MagicJohn: Now I have to disperse my green ships before you can trade for green and overload one of my star systems.
	MagicJohn: You now control large yellow. That could prove useful......

17) MagicJohn: Trade G2 Y2 Magicjohn
	ringebri: I'm only a lowly grasshopper.  How might I have foiled thee?
	MagicJohn: Lotsa "ifs" but.. If vorkin had been a yellow star system you might have traded your b1 for a g1. That threat of overloading overthemoon with green technology would made me modify my immediate plans.
	MagicJohn: uh.... make that "would have made me"..... or "would make me".... Need a proof reader...

18) ringebri: Move G3 Ringebri Vorkin
	MagicJohn: Now my threat is sacrificing my y2 in magicjohn and moving two g3's into vorkin. I would still need another y2 to send them into "ringer", but that would wipe out your green technology including your green home star. You can't attack #2 ships with a #1 red ship, so vorkin is a safe platform for me at the moment.  
	MagicJohn: Oh, just realized... I don't know if the size of a red star influences what can be attacked in that star system. I don't think so, but I'm not sure. Maybe we should check out the rules on that point...
	MagicJohn: Nuts... still need a proof reader... Second to last comment. I only have 2 g2's (not g3's) to move into vorkin.

19) MagicJohn: Discover G2 Overthemoon Y2 Overtherainbo
	ringebri: Not sure what I'm doing.  I knew I could move the g3 into Vorkin so I did but I'm not sure.... You can do multiple commands, right?
	MagicJohn: If you sacrifice a ship, you can make as many moves as the size of the ship you sacrificed. Catastrophes result from other moves so are technically two command moves. Otherwise you are limited to one command per turn. Your g3 and b1 are stuck in vorkin without "yellow technology".   
	MagicJohn: Trading could get you yellow technology....
	MagicJohn: It's really dangerous to not have a #3 ship in your home star system. It makes you very vulnerable to infiltration.

20) ringebri: Build B1 Ringebri

21) MagicJohn: Sacrifice G3 Magicjohn
Build G2 Overthemoon
Build G3 Magicjohn
Build G3 Overtherainbo

22) ringebri: Trade B1 Y1 Vorkin
	MagicJohn: Sacrifice is the quickest way to acquire more ships. You might think of sacrificing your g3 for two b2's and a b3. If you do, be careful and don't overload blue in your home system.

23) MagicJohn: Discover G1 Overthemoon Y2 Overthetop

24) ringebri: Move G3 Vorkin Overthemoon
	MagicJohn: By owning a bunch of green ships and creating green stars a player can control an opponent's access to a technology (green in this case). Your green home star keeps you in the game unless I can destroy it.
	MagicJohn: If you sacrifice your g3 it goes back in the stack and you can rebuild it as part of your 3 building moves. ie.... Sacrifice g3 vorkin (return) build y1  vorkin (return) build y3 ringebri (return) build g3 vorkin.
	MagicJohn: OOOPS!!!! Wrong, wrong, wrong. When you build a ship, you have to have another ship of that color in the star system. Thus, if you sacrifice your g3, you have no more green ships and could not build another. Your only access to green ships would be trading for one and I would gobble it up before you could do that. Sorry 'bout the misinfo but I'm still trying to learn the game too....

25) MagicJohn: Trade G3 Y3 Magicjohn

26) ringebri: Build B1 Ringebri
	MagicJohn: Dangerous situation...

27) MagicJohn: Build G3 Magicjohn

28) ringebri: Trade B1 Y1 Ringebri

29) MagicJohn: Sacrifice Y3 Magicjohn
Move G1 Overthetop Ringebri
Move G2 Overtherainbo Ringebri
Move G3 Overtherainbo Ringebri
Catastrophe Ringebri Green

30) ringebri: Trade B1 G1 Ringebri
	MagicJohn: The material cost of the sacrifice was a lot but it really cuts down your options. You have to keep working for green and maybe attacking my blue star.

31) MagicJohn: Discover G2 Overthemoon Y2 Overthehill

32) ringebri: Move Y1 Ringebri Magicjohn
	MagicJohn: Now I will try to go after yellow....

33) MagicJohn: Attack Y1 Magicjohn
	ringebri: Oh my! This system has a lot of ships.

34) ringebri: Build G1 Ringebri
	MagicJohn: ...or yellow is coming after me...
	ringebri: Was that the "attack" order and were you able to do that because you have a red sun?
	MagicJohn: Yes, that was the "attack" order. The red sun gives me access to the "attack" order. It only works if I have a ship in the star system larger than or equal to the size of the ship I'm attacking 

35) MagicJohn: Sacrifice Y2 Magicjohn
Move Y1 Magicjohn Overthemoon
Move Y1 Overthemoon Overthehill

36) ringebri: Trade G1 B1 Ringebri

37) MagicJohn: Sacrifice G3 Magicjohn
Build Y2 Overthehill
Build Y2 Overthehill
Build Y3 Magicjohn
	ringebri: If I built the g2 ship in ringebri you would move a g2 into ringebri, cause a catastrophe, and wipe out all of the green. Right?

38) ringebri: Move B1 Ringebri Vorkin
	MagicJohn: Yes, probably so, but my major objective is to get your yellow star. Also, I would have moved my g1 from MagicJohn instead of a g2. Less sacrifice on my part given the state of our economy....

39) MagicJohn: Sacrifice Y3 Magicjohn
Move Y1 Magicjohn Ringebri
Move Y1 Overthehill Ringebri
Move Y2 Overthehill Ringebri
Catastrophe Ringebri Y

	MagicJohn: Sorry, I should have made the game "unrated". Try another one?
