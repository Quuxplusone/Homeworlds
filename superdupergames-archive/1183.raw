1) andylooney: Homeworld B1 G2 Y3
	Laurie_Menke: Hi, Andy...here I stand, a Lab Rabbit who doesn't know how to play Homeworlds, hoping you'll have pateince with her while she learns.  If you would rather, I can resign...I know you must be having to play a large number of newbies on SDG.  Just let me know which you would prefer.  Thanks!

	andylooney: OK, I'm going to go easy on you because you're learning. You have 4 blue pieces in your homeworld. That means I could destroy them all just by typing "Catastrophe Laurie_Menke Blue". I won't this time, but I will next time...

14) Laurie_Menke: Trade B2 Y2 Laurie_menke

25) andylooney: Build R2 Andylooney
	andylooney: Your earlier request for advice was too vague for me to think of a reply to, but I'll give you a tip now: you should never leave your Homeworld undefended, i.e. without a Large ship there. We call this Starship Captain Rule #1.

26) Laurie_Menke: Move Y2 Laurie_menke Reforestation
	Laurie_Menke: OK...great!  Thank you!  :o)  I was concerned that I had little access to green and it was almost gone, but I could have used a different ship to discover the new system.  I'll correct that right away.  Thanks!

	Laurie_Menke: OK, I don't know if you'll tell me this or not, but I'm curious why you're building up your men on systems that are TWO moves away from my homeworld.  Why wouldn't you want to move in closer?

37) andylooney: Discover Y1 Clampett G2 Fantasyisland

38) Laurie_Menke: Move R1 Laurie_menke Fantasyisland
	andylooney: Well, a good attack route is built on a strong foundation.
	Laurie_Menke: OK...you're right...that makes sense.  BTW, I love your new system's name...now you've got me picturing Tattoo yelling, "De Plane, De Plane!!!"

	Laurie_Menke: Well, I don't see any way to disable your b2 or otherwise prevent the attack, so the best I can do is minimize damage...so here goes my best shot.  :o/
