Started: 2005.12.19, Ended: 2005.12.31
Participants: Toni (S), xoet (N)
Winner: xoet

1) xoet: Homeworld G3 B2 Y3

2) Toni: Homeworld Y1 B1 G3 *
	xoet: ok i typed homeworld g3 b2 y3
	xoet: and this is what happened   now type the same thing because im told that yellow is for moving blue is for changing the colors of the ships(triangles)
	xoet: and green is like the connection glue i think but we will see
	xoet: so typing two homeworlds and a ship 
	xoet: homeworld b3 g3 y3 i think is the best home world you really dont want red till you start attacking mid game i guess it is
	xoet: but sometimes you may want to mix it up like homeworld b3 g2 y2
	xoet: with one of each you cant lose i guess dont know the concepts of how to play just what works and does not work thru trial and error
	Toni: b3 g3 y3 all three are giving me the same error message I got on the other game "an unrecognized command"  I never could figure out how to get them in my box in the other game either.
	Toni: tried it again with "homeworld" starting the command and  got this....It is very important that your starting stars be different sizes! To override this check, please append an asterisk (*) to the end of the 'homeworld' command (eg. homeworld y1 b1 g3 *). 

3) xoet: Build Y1 Xoet

4) Toni: Pass
	Toni: Well got it to take it, so here it is, such as it is.

5) xoet: Build Y1 Xoet
	xoet: mmmm   they may not have undo working right with all the games    but really it does not matter too much about the number cause you can make it up later
	xoet: that might have been because you had small ships  dont know   but i typed the next line above
	xoet: build y1 xoet
	xoet: you should type the follow line not much else to do
	xoet: build g1 Toni
	Toni: build g1 gives the message...The system does not exist.

6) Toni: Build G1 Toni
	Toni: could not get anything to work.. just kept telling me that the system does not exist.
	xoet: typing what is in quote's "build g1 Toni" will get the green hopefully   i will pass also now
	xoet: not letting me pass i will pass next turn to keep it even for both our sakes

7) xoet: Pass
	xoet: what i did was "build y1 xoet" you should type "build g1 Toni" that should get you a ship in your system "Toni"

8) Toni: Build G1 Toni
	Toni: ok that worked

9) xoet: Discover Y1 Xoet B1 Emc2
	xoet: there i did not know how to pass i thought there should of been a button   but could not find it before
	xoet: this is what my other opponent posted for me to gather my abilities with the game for the big game im play with those other two ppl    
	xoet: ts52 "Yeah, there are a few adages for this game: always start with two different sizes in your homewold - this makes it harder for your opponent to get into your homeword. always start with a large ship - there is strength in size between your homeworld and starting ship, have blue, green and yellow. You need green to build, and yellow to move, and eventually blue to trade for red. But if you don't have those three, you'll end up wasting time getting the one you don't never leave your homeworld undefended. - Keep a large ship in your homeworld if at all possible. finally, once you opponent has a gun, you get a gun. - Once things escalate to red ships, it becomes an arms race. If you had kept a large ship in your homeworld, and traded one of your ships on bluebird to red right after I'd traded for a red ship, then when I moved into your homeworld, you could've sacrificed the red ship to take over my red ship, and still been alive. We really didn't get into sacrifices in this game at all, but they are another powerful tactic in the game that it's important not to overlook."
	xoet: sacrifice how do you do that ???   i dont know i will have to ask him to show me   lol

10) Toni: Build G1 Toni
	xoet: problem being he typed that after it was certian i would lose  and of course the game is over with ts52

11) xoet: Pass
	xoet: now we got to worry about over populations so i am move my little ship out to "discover y1 xoet b1 emc2"
	xoet: your command might look like "discover g1 Toni y1 yolanda"
	xoet: or you could "move g1 Toni emc2"
	xoet: i think that should work too but if you get too many ships in your home system there is the catastrophe   but i dont know how that works yet
	Toni: with the coding you gave...move g1 Toni emc2 and discover g1 Toni y1 yolanda... I get this message - These systems are not connected

12) Toni: Discover G1 Toni G2 Yolanda

13) xoet: Build Y2 Xoet

14) Toni: Build G2 Yolanda

15) xoet: Move Y2 Xoet Emc2

16) Toni: Build G2 Yolanda

17) xoet: Discover Y1 Emc2 G3 Santa

18) Toni: Pass

19) xoet: Build Y2 Xoet
	xoet: now in a regular game an opponent would of said "catastrophe Yolanda g" because four of the same color and you are over populated suggestion either "move g1 yolanda Santa" or discover a new system or something i dont think you can trade without a blue ship or star but you might be able too
	xoet: _magical_me: From the rules: "Two systems are connected to each other if they do not share the same size system markers. If two systems contain the same size system marker, those two systems are not connected. Therefore, a small system is connected to any medium or large system, but not to another small system. A binary system made up of a small piece and a medium piece is not connected to any small or medium system, nor is it connected to any binary system that contains a small piece or a medium piece. System connections have nothing to do with the physical positions of systems on the playing field." 

20) Toni: Trade G1 B1 Toni
	Toni: Had to pass.. got this message... "You have 2 unused actions. This system requires you to explicitely PASS any undesired actions" 

21) xoet: Build Y2 Santa
	xoet: mmm i think we need to do something about the four greens in yolanda

22) Toni: Build G1 Yolanda B1 Kassa

	xoet: but maybe take a day off till I can read the rules over a few more times if you want

27) xoet: Build Y3 Xoet

28) Toni: Trade G1 R1 Toni
	xoet: good now you can trade the green into maybe yellow but you might have to trade them into blues

29) xoet: Move B3 Xoet Bill
	xoet: now your best bet would be "trade g3 Toni y3"
	xoet: actually you should be able to trade some greens in the yolanda system
	xoet: oh and i am unsure if this exists in this game yet but it does in byte and impasse   in small letters there is a little link saying view all moves   and then you just pick and choose!!! in the form scroll bar
	xoet: so ive undone my last move to see if homeworlds has a move choice selection but could not find one   oh well

30) Toni: Move R1 Toni Yolanda *
