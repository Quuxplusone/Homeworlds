	wil: Howdy Angel, I'm fairly new to the game and trying to play a lot to learn....have you played much??
	wil: as discussed on the other game....unless you are testing some new idears...we could start over...in general two sizes in your binary homeworld star provides better protection (two systems to get from one homeworld to the other) also in your homeworld you'd like red because you want to be able to defend, green because you need it to grow, and blue because you need it to change colors...yellow is for moving, and is important...but can be aquired through growing and changing (as can red....but blue and green are required as far as I know, not in your star, but being present)  


4) wil: Build G1 Wil

5) Argel: Discover R1 Argel G2 Galata

6) wil: Build G1 Wil

	wil: Your are going to need trade capability in your homeworld...you'll need to eventually build to a blue star, get both transportation (yellow) and blue there and get it back to your homeworld....just my thoughts...
	wil: Argel, I've been on a rapid path of learning this game in the past few months.  I am open to playing more and discussing what we can learn from one another about its complexities.
