Keith: Hello Unic. If you are as tough a Homeworlds player as you are a Cannon player then I am in trouble.

3) unic: Build G1 Unic
unic: Sadly, I'm not... of the games I've tried so far here on the server, Homeworlds is the one I have the worst record in. Cannon uses much more familiar thought patterns from other abstracts... much easier to draw on experience from them.

Keith: You certainly seem like a tough Homeworlds to me.
Keith: Opponent. Tough opponent.
unic: My rating (16th percentile... so near the bottom) and record so far (1 win, 6 losses) tell a different story.

Keith: 16th percentile huh? Oh well in that case I feel much better about this being such a close match. ;)

Keith: FWIW I beat Zoltar in our last matchup. So you must be learning something.

22) Keith: Build G1 Keith
unic: I got into a reasonable position in my very first game against Zoltar... but lost it in the end. The times I've played him since then, he's beaten me soundly!
Keith: I missed that completley. Was focused on sacrificing my Y3 to catastrophe you.

Keith: I had Zoltar down one system and I had more and better ships... and lost.
