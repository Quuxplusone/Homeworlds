Homeworlds Online (SDG# 30097)
Variants: "Unrated, Sinister"
Started: 2016.7.27, Ended: 2016.11.23
Participants: Felix (S), Kalimantan (W), Skully (N), Draw5PlayAll (E)
Winner: Felix

1) Skully: Homeworld G3 Y2 B3

2) Draw5PlayAll: Homeworld R3 B1 G3

3) Felix: Homeworld G2 R3 B3

4) Kalimantan: Homeworld G2 B1 Y3

5) Skully: Build B1 Skully
	Kalimantan: Hey what does it mean that the variant is sinister?
	Draw5PlayAll: Objective is to destroy the guy on your left.
Skulls must destroy Draw5PlayAll (me)
I must destroy Felix (annoyingly)
Felix must destroy Kalimantan
Kali must destroy Skully
	Draw5PlayAll: If someone other than your right destroys you, the game continues without you. So if I was destroyed by Felix (say) then Skully's target becomes Felix.

6) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall

7) Felix: Build B1 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: There is a flaw though. If I am facing imminent doom from Skully, I might set up the conditions so that one of the other two players can call catastrophe and eliminate me, preventing Skully from winning.

8) Kalimantan: Build Y1 Kalimantan

9) Skully: Discover B1 Skully Y1 Evil

10) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall

18) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall

19) Felix: T Y1 G1 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: There really is no point to this conspiracy. If I really, really have to move out I can easily trade my G3 into a Y3 to give myself movement powers.
	Skully: Ah that is true. Id have to be just plane Sinister if that were part of my plan. ;)

20) Kalimantan: Build Y1 Kalimantan
	Felix: I see what you did there :p
	Draw5PlayAll: *I'd *plain

	Draw5PlayAll: I see a move for West. Sac your Y2@Kalimantan and move two greens at Hell into Pax, blowing up his factory. This move is completely optional.
	Draw5PlayAll: Time to resume the clocks.
	Draw5PlayAll: What I mean is, I have belayed the orders to assist our galactic neighbors in life support. In approximately 84 hours they will be dead.
