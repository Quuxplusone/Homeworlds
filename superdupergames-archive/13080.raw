	efwin: Perhaps I should venture forth soon...

13) MadWuher: Build Y2 Edora

30) efwin: Move B1 Enoneergtod Owtwolleytod
	efwin: Strategy question -- I see that I could have sacrificed one of my yellow ships and moved greens to your homeworld or yellows to Bolonga to cause a catastrophe -- but it seemed like I would have had to have spent too many resources for what would have been a more or less even tradeoff of the ships -- am I thinking about that right?  Do you typically only catastrophe if you hurt the opponent more than yourself? 
	MadWuher: Right. Typically only cause catastrophes if you will end up ahead in the numbers game, or you take out more points of ships than you are losing. Right now, I could cause you to lose your 2 green 2's by losing only 4 points of ships (sac a y2 and move my g1's into owtwolleytod (DotYellowTwo??? interesting naming habit)) I'm just looking to see if there are any other options available for me. 

31) MadWuher: Build G3 Edora

32) efwin: Trade G2 R2 Owtwolleytod
	efwin: OK, thanks for confirming that -- Not sure if I'll stick with the naming thing - when I had to name the first one, I thought "one green dot" and then just flipped each word -- but I guess "green one dot" or "one dot green" are really more accurate so maybe I'll have to switch things around the next game...
	MadWuher: Oh-oh. You might want to take that move back.......
 

	efwin: Thanks -- I only counted two green ships and thought I was safe (still learning)

41) MadWuher: Sacrifice G1 Edora

	efwin: I'm thinking that the fact that you have five size 3 ships and I have one, is not so good for me

45) MadWuher: Move Y3 Edora Enoneergtod

46) efwin: Build R1 Owtwolleytod

47) MadWuher: Sacrifice R1 Madwuher
Attack R2 Enoneergtod
	efwin: Sacrifice question (v. hypothetical - I'm not planning anything) -- if you sacrifice a red ship, do you affect only ships up to the size of the sacrificed red ship in the other star systems, or can you affect a ship up to the largest size of a ship you have in that star system -- for example, I foolishly move my Y3 to Bologna, can you sacrifice your R1 @ MadWuher and attack my Y3 with your Y3 there, or not?
	MadWuher: Here are some options:
If you move an R3 into MadWuher I can attack it without sacrificing my r1 there. I have access to the technology at my homeworld so I can use it. 
If instead you get your y3 to Camelot then I cannot attack your y3 without a sacrifice because I do not have access to red at that system. By sacrificing any size red at any system I can use the red power (attacking) at any system. If I sacrifice a sized 2 red ship, then I can make two attacks (each at different systems if I'd like). If I sacrifice a sized 2 ship, and I only wanted one attack action, then I type pass as my second attack action.
 
Does this make sense??

48) efwin: Build G1 Owtwolleytod

49) MadWuher: Move R3 Edora Madwuher
	efwin: OK, thanks -- that makes sense.  I think I was confused by the red having the size comparison aspect...  and I wasn't considering that access to technology = ability to use that technology with any ship in the system
