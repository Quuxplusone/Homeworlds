1) Sarthobi: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3
	Sarthobi: Lets see how i'll do this time

2) wil: Homeworld R3 B2 G3
	wil: COOL!!  Thanx..so openings...you've chosen the best one...or the one the best players like to use most and win with most... The Banker...I'll take Goldilocks...no...I'll take fortress, I want to learn how to use it to my advantage.

3) Sarthobi: Build G1 Sarthobi
	Sarthobi: I guess the red in the opening lets you stay defensive if i come by with a shi, right?
And i like this game :)
Trying to think of a way to make some AI for it that wont act foolish.

4) wil: Build G1 Wil
	wil: We dream of someone creating an app where you just slide pieces from the bank to the position...it jumps back if it is an illegal move... you can toggle on helps so whenever you touch a piece it shows where it can move...  of the day we can play a computer...  
	wil: Yes, having the power of defense in my star is just like having a gun at my star...  While I like having immediate transportation, having a defense system (can't be used in agression when it can't move or be sacked) is valuable...we come in peace.

5) Sarthobi: T G1 B1 Sarthobi

19) Sarthobi: Move B2 Sarthobi G3
	wil: So this is the building game...you've avoided being locked out of anything...and now it is trying to not be the person that lets the other gain in the larger ships...(while being the person that takes the upper eddge in the larger ships)
	Sarthobi: seems like it :]

20) wil: Discover Y1 Wil G1 G1

21) Sarthobi: Build G2 Sarthobi

22) wil: Discover G1 Wil Y1 Y1

23) Sarthobi: M G2 Sarthobi G3
	wil: Do you have a physical set of pyramids?  This display is just about the worst for actually figuring out what is going on...  
	Sarthobi: Hehe i dont, and this display aint toi good.. but we can manage :)

24) wil: Build G2 Y1

25) Sarthobi: D G2 G3 G2 G2
	wil: You should get a set....playing real time with others is great...and when you get to critical conditions in an online game seeing a real layout helps...a lot.  (I should do it more, but don't)

26) wil: Discover G2 Y1 Y3 Y3
	Sarthobi: I'm thinking about it, wanted to try out the game a few times before :)

27) Sarthobi: D G1 Sarthobi Y3 Y-3
	wil: That makes sense...I know no better two player strategy game.   I enjoy chess, but the flavor of this is superior...games are not ever close in look or feel, and the reboot caused by catastrophes as well as the 'banking' system is great.

28) wil: Move B1 Wil G1
	Sarthobi: When i first read the rules i wasn't sure the game had this much depth. The rules intriged me, but Playing it really changed the way i saw it.

29) Sarthobi: S G2 G2
B G2 Y-3
B G2 Sarthobi
	wil: John Cooper developed the most amazing game with the Looney Pyramids...  I am now learning Volcano, and Martian Chess, both good, but this is the best published game with them I know...having a set of them though is quite versatile...lots of games to play...  this one, play anywhere, no board needed...just a table.

	wil: and nice try..  enjoyed the game... before you made your move on me...if you'd have added a piece in your homeworld so you could sack your y2 and move two blues in...you'd've had the game!  
	Sarthobi: Thanks, great game.
I didnt think that move through. It was the general idea and i rushed it.
Oh well :)
	wil: lol...interesting battle over there..both of you going for monopolies... he's a good player... good luck

	wil: Please don't hesitate to challenge me again!
