	zoltar: That one I call the "teleport".  You can teleport a g2 to another green base for free when you do a build.
	zoltar: The third green trick is called "the investment", which would be where I'd stick a g1 or g2 on a lone 3-sized star, such as a Y3 or R3, and then when that color is used up, I sac the green ship and build the 3-sized ship in a crucial place (with the g2 sac, you also get to build the g2 back again).

	Tuxhedoh: any suggestions for recovery?
	zoltar: well, after my sacrifice, I'm ahead some extra pieces, and I'm going to threaten to blow up your green star, so you need to build ships as fast as possible and avoid more catastrophes.
	zoltar: moving a green ship out so that you could build more green as well as avoid a green star catastrophe would be a good idea.  And as soon as I get a red ship again, you will need one as well.

41) zoltar: Build B3 Zoltar
	Tuxhedoh: Sorry for my abscence...

	Tuxhedoh: in order to get any of those blues? I have to trade my y3 in huh?
	zoltar: Yep, which probably would be giving me the y3...
	Tuxhedoh: well fart.  It's my inclination to give up, mostly cause I dont' know what to do next... I'm willing to hang around if you have any pointers.
	zoltar: As someone who myself gets easily discouraged and tends to resign too soon (usually by intentionally blowing up my system to go out with a bang), I would be a hypocrite to tell you to endure more.  If you want to resign and start over, that might be better, unless you want pointers on how to bully someone when you've got them totally outnumbered (for example, you get two Y3's set up so you can sac them on two consecutive turns and invade and take out both stars one after another).  Here, I'm going to move a blue ship out, then sac my g2 and build the other b3's, then exchange them for r3's, then build b3's again, and so forth, and it's hard for you to stop me.
