	bhorner: Your last move scares me!
	TwoShort: I was wondering if you would sac your 2 to move your 1 in and blow up my yellows; that would put us back to the beginning, but me with as first-player, so slightly negative for you.  But I think (hope) this will be worse for you :)
  Anyway, since you asked, I've been looking for something to teach you, but so far you're not doing anything obviously wrong, just a few not-quite-what-I'd-do things:  I don't use a yellow (or green) homeworld star, so I have the option of growing more of them relative to the catastrophe threat; and I grow twice before moving out to have a second ship left at my homeworld so I can grow more ways there.

	bhorner: Yeah, I saw that too, I can't remember the exact details, but one option left you with an extra small and your turn, and one left us even with your turn...  So I kept searching for something else.
 
I'm used to playing with 4 or 5, I know the 2 player version will be different, but at the very beginning I didn't know how to play.  I think blue yellow is the strongest homeworld with more than 2 players...  I don't know if it will translate to 2 though...

	bhorner: Wow, is it over that quick?
	bhorner: er... half over?
	bhorner: nm, I always see the worst first, I think I can hold on for a while longer.
	TwoShort: At first I thought it was over, then I decided it was good for me, but not over, then I decided it was over, then I decided it was not over, and even good for you, now I'm wondering if it's over...
When I stick to a conclusion for a whole minute, I'll let you know :)
