3) rootbier: Build G1 Rootbier
	rootbier: Should I call out things that strike me as mistakes/poor choices? First one was your build with respect to mine. Taking the same small star - I will be able to take that remaining b1 before you -- which will give me early access to larger ships. You will be stuck building up through the small ships of another color while I build 2s and even 3s.
 
I can show you how that goes or you can undo and just switch the sizes on your two stars.
	rootbier: Well... onward then.
