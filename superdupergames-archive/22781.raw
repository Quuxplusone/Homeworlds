	ajo: I think you've let yourself get too spread out.
	goblin981: Maybe.  I saw a yellow catastrophe on the way.

23) ajo: Build G1 Alpha
	ajo: Sure, you've gotta defend against catastrophes. But this past turn, I would guess that you wanted to do something more productive than burn your y2. But you couldn't build anything because all you were able to build was yellows.
	ajo: Or maybe you have a plan and I'm gonna feel dumb later. :)

	goblin981: It was the latter :)
	goblin981: 
	ajo: I hope that wasn't *all* of your plan, though. I'm pretty happy to be up by r1y3g3 at this point.
	ajo: In fact, screw it, let's see if I can end it right now!

26) goblin981: T G1 B1 Goblin981
	ajo: Check. :)
	ajo: In fact, you won't have any access to green next turn, so that's got to be checkmate.

27) ajo: Attack G3 Goblin981
	goblin981: Unless I do that.  Knew you needed two moves :)
	ajo: Well yeah. Checkmate in two, I meant. Normally I don't trust myself to declare "mate in two", but this time it looked inevitable.

28) goblin981: T B1 Y1 Goblin981
	goblin981: Damn didn't see that.  You win this round.
	goblin981: Damn it.  You got me.

29) ajo: Attack Y1 Goblin981
	ajo: Toldja you shouldn't have been doing that with your yellows. :) Good game.
	goblin981: Thought for once I was going well.  Good game.
