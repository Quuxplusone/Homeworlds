	nycavri: Hello again!  This is only my third attempt at playing Homeworlds, and I was severely thumped in my first two games!  I hope I've learned something from those losses, though.  What's your Icehouse background?

	Uglyfoot: I have been a Mad Lab Rabbit for 3 years, doing several conventions around the Kansas City area.  I've been learning as many games as possible to support my 10+ stashes.  Volcano is a face-to-face favorite.

	Uglyfoot: For Homeworlds, I have been getting thumped at it for over a year now and last time I checked I had the worst rating.

	nycavri: Rabbit since December, when I discovered the Icehouse games at BGG, bought a bunch of Treehouse sets, Volcano caps, boards, books, stickers, coasters, and awndered over to SDG to play smoe of the more complicated games on a regular basis.  Homeworlds is clearly my favorite, despite my mediocre play, but I've loved playing Pikemen and BBT, both of which I had played elsewhere.  I've introduced everyone I've met to Icehouse, played Treehouse in bars and restaurants on 2 continents and will be whipping them out next week at the slightest provocation at the NY ComicCon.  Pity the Looneys can't be there.
	nycavri: I should read my posts before hitting send, 'specially when I'm excited.  I "sound" like a teenager.....
