	phi_618: Thank you for the game.
	Trydnt: no worries. you gotta look out for the small piece in the homeworlds at the start. whichever color was taken will leave only two smalls of that color left and so you have to take it or your opponent will be able to monopolize it in the next turn and there will be no smalls left to trade for then they're in the big guns and you won't be able to catch up easily
	phi_618: Thanks; that's a good way of explaining what went wrong here in a way easily applicable to future games.
	Trydnt: It was one of the best tips my teacher gave me early on. That and if you're going second it is often best to copy your opponent's moves in the beginning until you end up in a spot where to do so would open up a larger piece for them.
	phi_618: Ahh, kindof an application of the go proverb "Your opponent's best move is your best move" to the more independent initial stages of Homeworlds.
	Trydnt: Yup, in Go it stems from the position of the pieces but in HW it's really follows from the "focus on the economies" advice and trying to maintain a diverse portfolio scattered around to minimize risk of catastrophe
