8) bhorner: Discover Y1 Bhorner G1 S1
	bhorner: I've started a couple games, and it seems like everyone against me uses BY for their world, and G for their ship...  Is there a reason?  I made my ship Yellow for later triple sacrifice catastrophe moves, couldn't think of any other reason...

9) rootbier: Discover Y1 Rootbier B3 Cornfed
	rootbier: The g3 sacrifice can be really powerful (green sacrifices in general can be). None of the other sacrifices will give you back a size 3 ship (save certain rare attack situations I suppose) -- the g3-sac can not only get you right back to a g3 but can give you two more ships. You could generate half a catastrophe without losing a 3. You could generate multiple additional 3s.
 
As far as not having red at home -- I think people mix it up and sometimes do take it... but your safer just having a single little red ship at home (not supplying attack tech to visitors). And of course if you have the g3 as your flagship you're not going to want or need a green star... hence BY homes.
 
I'm often angling for a g3sac -- so you'll probably see it soon enough. It's also sometimes easy to just repeat and repeat.
