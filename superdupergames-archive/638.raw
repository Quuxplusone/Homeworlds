	MatrixFrog: Question: The whole good/evil thing isn't implemented yet, right? So how do we know who we should try to eliminate?
	MatrixFrog: From the SDG-announce mailing list:
 
I have just implemented a new victory condition for Homeworlds at SDG 
called "Left Man Down."  The player who elminates the person to his left 
is the victor.  "Left" is relative.  In a 3-player game, or a 4-player 
game where West seat has already been defeated, South's left-hand 
opponent would be North.  I have not yet tested this code in a live 
game, but my offline tests show it should work.  If you have any 
weirdness in a live game, please let me know.  If you have an existing 
3/4-player game running and everybody would like the victory conditions 
changed, let me know and I will make that happen.
	MatrixFrog: So, what do you guys think? Do we want to do that?
	rbryan: I'd say yes, because I think it should make a better game.  This is also my first three player game, so I don't have a particularly strong opinion.

17) zevzimra: Build Y2 Zevzimra
	zevzimra: Sure, that's fine, let's go for it...  can someone tell Aaron please?

19) rbryan: Build Y2 Rbryan
	Aaron: Done.  Please let me know if something weird happens with the next elimination.  It is easily undone.

	rbryan: Hmm, that ought to confuse them.  I mean, I wouldn't mis-type the size of the piece to discover twice in a row, would I?  Nope, not me.  Sigh.
	MatrixFrog: I'm confused. What did you mean to do?
	rbryan: Move to two smalls; hence adjacent to zevzimra, whom I'm meant to be attacking.  It's OK, it just means my master plan will need rethinking...
