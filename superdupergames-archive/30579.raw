1) zeder: Homeworld G3 B1 Y3

	Draw5PlayAll: Just so you know, MXPF has not signed on in over a month.
	zeder: Damnit!  I forgot about this person! How do he keep creating games?!
	Draw5PlayAll: Standing Challenge. It is a feature where you can have a challenge create itself automatically. Too bad it leads to this situation.
 
It is similar to how you always get spectators who have not signed on in years. They chose the option to monitor all Homeworlds games.
	zeder: Thank you for this informations.  I will remember this person next time.
	Draw5PlayAll: Withdraw the planetary regime plans -- our enemy's Life Support Systems are going to blow.
