16) bhorner: Build B2 Bhorner
	bhorner: I thought long and hard about that...  It really seemed like the best move, but it keeps us so similar to each other...
	Babamots: I expected to fight for blue control first, but at least we got around to it eventually.
 
Sorry to be so slow. I'm traveling and very distracted.

17) Babamots: Move B2 Babamots Orion
	bhorner: No worries, there are time controls.  I'm bound to be slow on you before the end.  :)
	bhorner: I don't see how I'll ever get ahead if I keep following you around...
	bhorner: But if I put myself behind, I won't get ahead either.  :)

19) Babamots: Build B3 Orion

20) bhorner: Build B3 Bush
	Babamots: I don't much like long mirror sessions, but I think it's the best thing for you at the moment and I don't know of a good way to break it yet.

21) Babamots: Discover B3 Orion Y2 Iconia
	bhorner: I've been making moves just to keep the mirror alive, so you couldn't burst ahead.  :)  I'm sure something will happen to break it.  I wish it didn't feel so much like luck (possibly a little in your favor) who will have the advantage in that moment.

22) bhorner: Trade B3 R3 Bush
	bhorner: Maybe now.  Maybe it won't look like an advantage, just a choice.

	Babamots: GG! Good luck in the tournament!
 
I wonder if my lonely little ship feels victorious...
	bhorner: Wow.  I'm so glad you won in a way i didn't see coming.  That was pretty spectacular.  :)
	Babamots: Glad you liked it. :-)
 
I suppose I prefer losing abruptly and unexpectedly. That kind of loss can show you something specific to look out for in the future. I feel more discouraged after those long drawn out games where I never make any headway and gradually get my life squeezed out.
	bhorner: Yeah, I never looked past one of the catastrophes.  I thought I kind of had no choice, but didn't realize it was over already.
