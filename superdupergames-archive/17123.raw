	captncavern: At least, I'm bringing down quite a few of your ships with me :)
Please don't mention most of them were mine only seconds before...
	dlwillson: Thanks for the fast turns, Captain. I notice you play a lot of other games here, too. May I offer a trade? You teach me your favorite non-Homeworlds game, and I'll teach you anything I might have learned about Homeworlds in a few non-rated games.
	captncavern: First, congratulation for the winning!
I'm not a very skilled teacher and I don't analyse the games I play too much, but if you want to try Mirador or Ordo... Those are the games I'm best at right now. I always have a challenge open at both of them. Mirador is a very short connection game, but it still offers interesting possibilities. In Ordo, you must reach your opponent's first line while preventing your opponent to split your pieces through capture. If any of this appeals to you...
