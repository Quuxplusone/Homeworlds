Pass
	dlwillson: I can put in my turns from my phone, but I can't chat from it, which is why I've been so quiet.
 
That was the fastest I've ever played a game on SDG, and I've played many here! Usually, it's a turn or two per day. Some players it's days per turn.
 
Do you want to try a handicap in the next game? I could start out with a small ship or all blue or something.
 
I HAVE played a lot of Homeworlds...
	Lurch: Yes, I think a handicap would make it more balanced.
	dlwillson: OK, let's do another one. Go to Challenges and pick up my standing challenge.
 
I'll go all-blue, which should be a Hell of a good handicap. I have to start with a trade to grow, and can't move until I trade again.
 
Lesson from this game:
 
Never let the other guy lock you out of a color, take the last small or medium if you must, but you can't let the other guy keep a monopoly.
