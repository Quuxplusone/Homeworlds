	Jesse: Have you played red-blue homeworlds much, Andy?  I had pretty much dismissed all homeworlds with red, but I saw in the game I played against sketchwick that they have some interesting properties, such as the freedom to choose dynamically whether to guard it with a y3 or g3.
	andylooney: Not lately. For a long time now, my standard opening was always B1 G2 Y3 (or B3 G2 Y3 if the other guy takes a 1-2 system) but more recently I've been wanted to experiment with other options again and red in the system has late game advances...
