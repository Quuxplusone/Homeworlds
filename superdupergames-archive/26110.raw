	wil: Fought on 2nd August, 216 BC, it was one of the major battles of Second Punic War. It took place in the town of Cannae in Italy. The army of Cathage, very easily defeated a numerically greater army of the Romans. The most significant fact associated with the battle is that more than 80% of the losing side was captured or killed by the army of Cathage under the leadership of legendary Hannibal.
