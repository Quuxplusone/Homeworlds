33) TwoShort: Build G2 Twoshort
	TwoShort: When I think I can definitely win a game, I like to calculate the maximum number of moves my opponent can hold me off for.  It's usually 3 or 4; one game recently was notable because it was 6.
 
So I'm sorry to say, I think I've got you here.  But if it's any consolation, this is a really cool game:  Unless I'm mistaken, I can force victory, but it will take 23 moves!

34) dlwillson: B R2 Dlwillson
	dlwillson: So, is there any way for me to have recovered after you popped the Y3 to control all the Y?
	TwoShort: I'm not entirely sure, but probably not.  When I decided to do it I figured to be sure I could maneuver from here to victory without giving you a yellow I needed control of 3 blue, and second green ship.  Since then I realized  I also two non-blue-non-yellow 3-point stars.  I still can't figure out for sure if you could have denied me any of those in ways I couldn't overcome, but it looked pretty good...

	dlwillson: 23 moves is a lot... :-)

	dlwillson: I can't really move very much. Not even to retreat. So, if you invaded my 2-pip system with a 3-pip, I wouldn't be able to do anything to you, or get away, just as an example. Lesson from this game: TwoShort will work very hard to lock a fellow out of yellow, and knows how to use the advantage, once gained. Corollary: Don't get locked out of yellow.

43) TwoShort: Discover Y2 Yelly R1 Roger

44) dlwillson: Build R2 Dlwillson
	TwoShort: Without red, I can't do much to attack until I can cause catastrophes, so I don't want to make contact until I can finish you.  But now that you mention it, controlling a 1-point star probably saves me a turn or two.
  But yeah, getting locked out of yellow is pretty certainly bad.  Sometimes the other guy can't get enough non-yellow stuff without giving one up.

45) TwoShort: Sacrifice G2 Yelly

	dlwillson: Ah, my problem is always insufficient attention to detail. I didn't realize that the cat blue would leave you ready for the cat yellow. Figured I had a turn or two to move. Oh well.
