1) gluco: Homeworld G3 B2 Y3
Keith: Hello gluco. My win/loss record is 2/5. Though I think I can still give you something to kick and scream about. Read the wiki for some good setup help.

23) gluco: Build Y1 Gluco
Keith: Are you familiar with "the factory" for accelerating ship building?
gluco: No actually. I take it that's what you just did with the sacrifice?

24) Keith: Sacrifice G3 Keith
Build G3 Keith
Build G3 Keith
Build Y2 Midworld
Keith: Correct. If this were an unrated game I would be a bit more helpful in advance.

25) gluco: Move Y1 Gluco Alphacent
Keith: By helpful I mean informative. I am now trying to deny you access to green ships and limiting your green access in general.

26) Keith: Discover Y1 Midworld B1 Mist
gluco: OK, helpful/informative is good. If you sacrifice a size 3, you can only get it back if there are no smaller ones left in the reserve stash of that color, right?
Keith: Sort of. There could be up to two smaller green ships. There were two G2s that I had to recruit back first to get to the G3. No smaller green ships is better since I could have gone for other colors. As it was I have 3 green ships in each sector. That would be a severe catasrophe risk if you had a green ship.

Move G1 Miranda Alphacent
Catastrophe Alphacent Green
Keith: I am not sure you understand how the red ships work. I can sacrfice an R1 in Keith and attack your R2 at Miranda with a G2.
gluco: I didn't realize you could attack with a green ship

33) gluco: Build R1 Gluco
gluco: Thanks! I'll try something else...
Keith: The sacrifice gives me the power of that color in any sector.
Keith: For example sacrificing a Y3 in Midworld would give me the power to make three ship moves anywhere. I feel kind of bad about being heavy handed with my moves. Think of them as lessons. Hard ones though. I prefer learning/teaching in unranked games. The best way to take out a group of ships around a star is to take out the star.

34) Keith: Discover R1 Keith Y2 Mote

35) gluco: Trade R1 Y1 Gluco
gluco: No prob - this is fun! Thanks for your tips and your patience. I will continue scheming...
Keith: We could set up a non-ranked game sometime and take more time to develope our positions (and possible schemes).

36) Keith: Move G1 Keith Mote

37) gluco: Discover Y1 Gluco G1 Paloverde
gluco: OK. Let's do that after this game. Thanks!

56) Keith: Move G3 Jacket Gluco

57) gluco: Build Y2 Antietam
Keith: Wow. I did not think you would be willing to lose your 3-pointer on defense at your home system.
Keith: You do have to be careful about exhausting your resources. You lost a Y2, G3, and G2 while I lost a G3 and G1. Also you now only have two one point ships and I have a 3-pointer and three two-pointers. Though having only an r1 at home makes me nervous.

58) Keith: Sacrifice R2 Paloverde
Attack R1 Gluco
Pass

Keith: Sacrificing a red gave me attack power in any sector I had ships. Like the gluco sector. Shall we try another game with slower development. Perhaps unrated or with some restriction like no catastrophies until after turn 10 or 12?
gluco: yea, it was a desperate move. Alternatively, I could have taken the 2 red shis at the other star. Maybe that would have been a better choice.
gluco: Thanks for the cool game!
Keith: Shall we try another game with slower development. Perhaps unrated or with some restriction like no catastrophies until after turn 10 or 12?
gluco: By all means! Would prefer to keep the rules unchanged, but we could keep it unrated.
Keith: Okay, you have been challenged.
