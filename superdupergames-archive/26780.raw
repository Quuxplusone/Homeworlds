	dlwillson: Well. Good game. I'll play it out, if you like.
	TeeTeeTee: That's up to you! It'd be quite reasonable to stop, here, if you think you can't make a come-back from this. (I don't believe that I've won a game after being two large ships down, before.)

	dlwillson: I'll resign so the ladder is open to other attackers. No point wasting time. Well played.
	wil: Helluva game guys!  I'ma gonna wait... see if you can get 2short outta the woods DL
	TeeTeeTee: Okay, then. Thanks!
 
I reckon that two things cost you the game, here. First was "15. Build y2 field": it let me go a large ship ahead, and I was able to harrass your small and medium ships in the centre from then on. The second was to trade away your blues, starting from "18. Trade b1 g1 field". At this point in the game, you had a far better grasp on the blue ships than I did, and there were lots of unbuilt b3s in the stash, which made blues very valuable. Indeed, sacrificing the g3 on this turn would have put you level with me on large ships (and you could have then sacrificed a smaller ship to prevent catastrophe on the next turn).
 
Also, I'm probably only going to defend my ladder position for maybe one or two more games: I kind of feel like I should give Homeworlds a rest for a bit. (Or, at least, I'd like to have the choice of when to accept games...)
	wil: dang they reach the top and then retire....
