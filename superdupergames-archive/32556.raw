Variants: "Hard time"
Started: 2017.6.28, Ended: 2017.7.1
Participants: dlwillson (S), Felix (N)
Winner: Felix

1) Felix: Homeworld R1 B3 G3

2) dlwillson: Homeworld Y3 B2 G3
	Felix: Here we go again! I suppose I'll take the Goldilocks for once, and see how it works for me :) I've been trying to really coerce the fortress into a viable competitive choice, but it really does seem to have its drawbacks.
	Draw5PlayAll: What about B2 R1?

3) Felix: B G1 Felix

4) dlwillson: Build G1 Dlwillson
	Felix: I wouldn't have minded if you had wanted to go banker, for the record :P

5) Felix: Trade G1 Y1 Felix
	dlwillson: I never go banker, for the record. :-)
	Felix: Fair enough! :)

6) dlwillson: Trade G1 Y1 Dlwillson

7) Felix: B G1 Felix
	Felix: So do you really believe the banker provides an unfair advantage? Or do you just not like to play it?


8) dlwillson: B G1 Dlwillson
	dlwillson: I don't think it gives an unfair advantage. I don't think it's as much a banker as it is a blocker. It's convenient to be able to block a big by discovering it. I think that's easy, but cashing it in... That's hard.
 
But, I think folks have the impression that it gives an advantage, so I don't play it.

9) Felix: Trade G1 R1 Felix
	Felix: I agree. I think in capable hands, all three setups can be equally good... but each one does have particular different strengths and weaknesses. It just depends on whether you'd like to be able to easily manipulate the supply of smalls, mediums, or larges.
 
But yeah, there is a certain stigma associated with it, so I try to avoid it too.

32) dlwillson: Trade G1 B1 Dlwillson

	Draw5PlayAll: Are you trying to reference the blue and green abilities?

39) Felix: Sacrifice Y1 Felix
Move G3 Sea Dlwillson
	dlwillson: I'm not. I was misreading the board. I thought I was losing worse than I am.

	Felix: I was just making a bad pun because I had just built a green ship.
	dlwillson: Oh, poo.
	Felix: I believe you did something similar to this to me in our last game! I hope it pays off... but I have had my most confident of moves totally overturned by your sneakery before.
	dlwillson: Not this time. You've got me. I can resign here or we can walk down the hill. Well done!
	dlwillson: I'm so used to Goldilocks... I thought Orcrist was in *my* orbit.
	Felix: Whatever you'd like to do! I always enjoy playing it out (when I'm winning!) but I understand if you'd just like to resign.
	Felix: And thank you! I just got lucky by throwing off your goldilocks game. :)
	dlwillson: I prefer to resign as soon as the end is inevitable, assuming perfect play on both sides. I think it is more interesting for people reading the game later and allows the players to move on to non-determined scenarios.
 
It's always a pleasure. Welcome to #1!
	dlwillson: Let me correct part of that. Not assuming "perfect play", assuming the quality of play thus far demonstrated. So, I don't resign if there's a fair chance the other fellow might fumble the ball.
	Felix: Sometimes when losing I play it out in hopes of the opponent making a game-changing mistake, but I do resign when it's completely inevitable, and it's too much to hope for certain opponents (like yourself) to make mistakes after a certain point!
 
And thank you very much! I don't think I'd be so fortunate if certain juggernauts like endo or TwoShort were still active, but I'll bask in the glory while I can and try not to accidentally reject a challenge on my tiny iPhone screen this time ;)
