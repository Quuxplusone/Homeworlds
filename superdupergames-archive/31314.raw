6) w00t: Build R1 W00t
	Ausmuh: So the circle of carnage is ausmuh kills w00t kills Draw5PlayAll? (With me winning at the end of course.)
	Draw5PlayAll: The game ends once one of those three things happens. So if w00t gets me out, then w00t wins.
 
That being said, Sinister is broken in the sense that someone can simply resign (or if they want, make one move and then resign) when they are about to be defeated.
	Ausmuh: Got ya. Thanks!
