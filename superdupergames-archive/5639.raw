Keith: At one time I was a big frog in the small pond of Prineville.
Keith: You moved your 3-pointer out of your homeworld! Gutsy move. Even when it looks safe I am always worried that I am overlooking something and making a game ending mistake.

28) jeep: Sacrifice B1 Yonkers
Trade G3 Y3 Bend
jeep: Yeah, it frightens me too, but not as much as you having a Yellow Monopoly.
jeep: Of course, I got "unlucky" and forgot to consider something.

Keith: You have not played at your usual level this game. Between moving and trading you have spent 5 turns juggling your 3-pointer in your home system. This time it has caught up with you.
jeep: Yeah, no idea what happened. In HW and Alien City, it seems that once I make a mistake, I get over flustered and can't recover. Most likely a mental thing on my part.
