	riddick: From the Homeworlds website -- http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Ginohn/games/Homeworlds/HomeworldsRules.html -- "Two systems are connected to each other if they do not share the same size system markers. If two systems contain the same size system marker, those two systems are not connected." -- So wouldn't that mean that my 1 and 2 sized star system homeworld is correct? Phil shouldn't be able to get to me if my star sizes match his.
	johannz: I didn't say they were connected. I said they were "close together". Phil can go to a whatever-3, then straight to your homeworld. But if you had built a Y1, B3, he would have to go to a 2, then a 3, then your homeworld. Instead of 2 jumps away, you would be 3.

5) riddick: Build G1 Riddick
	riddick: Thanks man -- Phil and I will just be close to each other then this game.

6) johannz: Build B1 Johannz

	johannz: See forum message #7611 for details of issue 
	Aaron: Is riddick not able to play?  My tests show he is the current player.
	johannz: No, he is able to. The problem was earlier, on 2009-06-18 10:18:47, when untcodegeek accidently abandoned his homeworld. It glitched, but self-fixed when he undid the move.
