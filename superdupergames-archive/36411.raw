	dlwillson: You too!
	phi_618: Here's some backstory for my civilization before I lose. :D
	phi_618: A war decades in the making is raging between two powerful civilizations; antipathies not a generation old fester to rival the most ancient of feuds: a quest for greater knowledge and understanding corrupted by bloodlust: history of relative peace forgotten in blind pursuit of otherwise laudable goal.
 
The official doctrine of the current government administration of the Kankinkni, a civilization developed under the auspices of Creation and Transformation, is to establish self-sustaining communities on new worlds, though detractors point out that exercising control over those communities may prove impossible. According to a recent study conducted by the KHAN!!! (Kankinkni Honest Association of Polling) says that 5 p/t (5 per/tex == 5/16: the Kankinkni use a hexadecimal base for most purposes) of bar fights (legally defined as a fight between a number of persons not exceeding 4, where all participants were under some non-zero degree of influence of intoxicating beverages and/or drugs, where no weapons were used, and where all parties appeared to be at least minimally amenable to the fight at the time of it's initiation) were primarily over disagreement over whether these colonies, if and once established, would prove bastions of peace and prosperity, or strongholds of tyranny wreaking terror through the galaxy.
 
Yet not all are on board with the war. There exists a minority, but very powerful, Kankinkni faction, the Kankinkni Diplomats, with members of standing scattered across worlds who seek a peaceful resolution, believing that by such means, the knowledge which all in their society seek may be more readily and effectatiously acquired. If the Kankinkni Diplomats are right, an alliance may be the route to the best outcome for all of Kankin.
	phi_618: oops, I messed up the acronym. I guess the Kankinkni Honest Association of Polling isn't so honest after all.

4) dlwillson: B G1 Dlwillson
	dlwillson: Good backstory! I like the proper definition of bar fight.

5) phi_618: Trade Y1 B1 Phi_618
	phi_618: Thank you, I'm experimenting with using things such as the Decktet, Tarot Cards, and the I Ching to generate prompts for rpg plots, world-building, random encounters, &c.. Here I used the Decktet and filled out details from there.
 
I should note that I made up the bar-fight definition. It's true for the Kankinkni (because I say so), but I'm not a lawyer and I have no idea how (or even if) "bar fight" is defined in the US or other Earth countries. I do think it seems like a reasonable formalization of what "feels" like it could be called a bar fight, though.

7) phi_618: Build B2 Phi_618

8) dlwillson: B B2 Dlwillson

9) phi_618: Discover B1 Phi_618 G3 Jokror
	phi_618: While still profitable, a relatively small trade federation by the name of Kanmar, watchful of market oversaturation looming on the horizon, takes the risk to send their largest ship to a new star: Jokror. Unfortunately, the planets orbiting Jokror are barren of sapient life. Without fuel enough to yet return home to Kankin, the bedraggled remnants of the once successful Kanmarkni must sustain themselves: not to profit, but even survive. Thus we leave the Jokrorkni: unwittingly trading prosperity for austerity.

	phi_618: Kisyoutenketu
 
Kiku (the Island): The Jokrorkni have discovered sufficient raw resources on Jokror to maintain their growing fleet.
 
Syouku (the Consul): Kanochim (chim /xim/: son-of; Kanochim: son-of-Kanoch (not *Kano), due to haplology) has gained a good deal of respect as well as wealth for himself among the Jokrorkni, and not undeservedly, it may be said: he has established himself for resourceful solutions to the problems faced by a budding civilization no large misfortune from death. Some, of course, envy his wealth, but by and large his usefulness keeps such sentiments at bay, and Kanochim is more than capable of using that to his advantage; accruing an unknown quantity of resources, knoweledge, and allies as he, a Kachinkni (Diplomat, believed to be a portmanteau of "Kankin" and "Chinos" "king") aims for seccession of Jokror from Kankin in a bid to elevate the negotiating power of the Kachinkni to that of a sovereign state.
 
Tenku (the Penitent): Kanan (nan: daughter-of; Kanan: daughter-of-kan), the navigator of the original Kanmarkni trade ship which embarked to Jokror, {Spread: personality progression} {the Diplomat} was born into a family dedicated Kachinkni, {Ace of Wyrms} but rebelled against their ideals which she viewed not just as naive, but as a fundamentally fruitless endeavor good only to waste time draining the sea of chaos which would always find its level. {the Origin} She left home upon reaching the age of majority and wandered Kankin for the next few years, supporting herself through a combination of odd jobs (mostly legal, but some illegal drugs as well, which, while she avoided most of them, she had no particular antipathy towards; not compared to that towards those who outlawed them, in any case) and helping herself to what the wilds of Kankin have to offer those few who don't get trapped, lost, or killed. {the Forest} It was within these wilds, as she was wandering one day, having had a breakfast of berries wrapped in some edible leaves, contemplating philosophy, as she often did, {the Chance Meeting} when she came across Kanmarchim. Kanmarchim, though the son of Kanmar, was not set to take over Kanmar on his father's death, but this was no bother to him. He would be assured a quite comfortable job within its ranks for as long as he wished it regardless, and the stress of constant business dealings were not something he could imagine himself dedicating himself to. This was why he often left Kanmar property for weeks at a time, visiting one city or another, traveling the wilds one trip, the wastes the next. It was on just such a trip, as he was picking his way through the wilds of Kanmar, having but recently eaten a (mostly) cooked rabbit he had trapped overnight, contemplating a hand of Terrapin he had recently played with some of the men who worked the night shift at Kanmar, when he encountered Kanan. Talking over a hand of Terrapin, which they both soon discovered the other was far better at than they had initially assumed, (though it may be said that Kanmarchim was less surprised, as he had known his share of "everybodies" who could fleece f.f p/t of more well-to-do afficionados. In fact, this made it easier for him to find games, appearing as he did an easy mark) they came to an understanding. Having just gotten a fold with a 6-card Turtle Butt, Kanmarchim, adding the pool of sticks they were using as chips to his pile, raised the suggestion that Kanan cover for him once in while, filling out some of the more time-sensitive paperwork, in his absences. Kanan agreed, on the condition that she not have to sign any contract which would bind her to Kanmar, figuring that it was something she had not yet tried. {the Merchant} Over the next few years they continued in this way, until the work completed by one or the other bore little dissimilarity, not for their differences eroding, but becoming eachother's as well as their own. When the mission to Jokror was announced in a highly confidential meeting, Kanan was the first person not in the meeting to find out. She showed up at Kanmar's office that afternoon and asked to be assigned to the mission. Despite the fact that Kanan wasn't even employed at Kanmar, strictly speaking, though everyone knew more or less what was going on by this point, and that she definitely wasn't supposed to know about this mission, not that Kanmar expected anything else from Kanmarchim, (nor particularly minded: if that was the worst thing his son did, he could hardly complain) he acceeded to her request. Kanmarchim stayed behind at his father's request, though he would have much preferred to join her, by this point. Now, stranded on Jokror, Kanan finds herself wanting to return to Kankin and, more relevantly, Kanmar. Unfortunately for her, Kanochim is rapidly gaining support amongst the Jokrorkni.
 
Kekku {the Forest}: Deep in the wilds of Jokror Kanan hides one of Kanochim's ships; she suspects few if any know to what extent Kanochim truly controls Jokror. Silently, she gathers those who agree with her, many with families on Kankin, and leaves Jokror for a new destination wherefrom they can restock and thereafter return to Kankin: Joranmund.
	phi_618: Note: I am deciding on moves and then coming up with a story post facto, so all bad moves are my own, not influenced (at least consciously) by narrative convenience.
	dlwillson: I *love* playing this game with you! Do you do this in all your games?
	phi_618: Not yet; I decided to try it this game, and it's quite fun.
	phi_618: Next time I should probably force myself to write dialogue, as I'm terrible at it. Like, My Immortal bad.

23) phi_618: Build G2 Phi_618
	dlwillson: I don't know what "My Immortal bad" means.
	phi_618: The worst fanfiction ever written.

	dlwillson: Hm. I can't tell if it's satire or not.
	dlwillson: Gotta be satire.
 
'Hi Draco! I said in a depressed voice.'

25) phi_618: Move G2 Phi_618 Jokror

26) dlwillson: B G3 Dlwillson
	phi_618: So where do you think I went wrong this game? Was it just a tactical mistake last move, or was I already losing strategically (I suspect I was)?

27) phi_618: Move B1 Jokror Joranmund
	dlwillson: Well, we could start with your Homeworld choice. There are good reasons to choose blue/red, and good reasons to choose blue/yellow, but I haven't yet heard defense of the other combinations. Did you try blue/green on a lark, or was there a reason?
	phi_618: That's a good place to start. I knew that B/G/Y (or possibly B/G/R), but did not realize that the g3 would be more valuable than the y3.
 
Thanks for the reply. As long as I can improve one thing each game, I'm bound to improve, right? :D

	dlwillson: Incremental improvement will carry you far.
That said, I've learned a lot by reading and understanding a few people's strategy guides, too.
*That* said, nothing teaches like experience.
	dlwillson: Here's my first best strategy tip:
Remember there are only 3 ways to win:
1- Cat your opponent's stars.
2- Attack your opponent's ships in their home system.
3- Cat your opponent's ships in their home system.
 
Every turn, look for a path to a win. If there's no path to a win, look for a path to an economic or positional advantage.
Look for your opponent's paths to a win. Look for your opponent's paths to advantage.
Play to foil your opponent's best move *only* when you must, because you literally can't win that way.

34) dlwillson: Sacrifice Y3 Dlwillson

Catastrophe Phi_618 G
	dlwillson: GG! TY!
 
Have you seen this strategy guide?
https://www.icehousegames.org/wiki/index.php?title=Homeworlds_strategy
	phi_618: I've read it twice, but that was a while ago and I always forget 90% of it.
	phi_618: Thanks for the Strategy tips as well.
 
I'll probably come back at some point to fill in/wrap up the story.
	dlwillson: Play a lot of games against players who are slightly stronger than you are.
 
I'm down for a teaching game any time. For that matter, we could play over Discord or Zoom and discuss the strategy of each move as we do it.
 
One more thought: Have you seen the "Homeworlds Theatre" series on YouTube? It's pretty fun and has the game's authors: John Cooper and Andy Looney.
	dlwillson: I meant Mumble or Jitsi, not Discord or Zoom.
