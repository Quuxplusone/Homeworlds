	deanthebean: I think I understand the rules but the game's not really clicking in my mind for some reason. 
	Felix: It takes quite a few games to start to get a handle on the "game within the game" so to speak. understanding the rules is one thing, but it's very hard to visualize the bigger strategy. One of the things that makes this game so great. Don't get discouraged, but keep playing, and it will start to click after a while. It took me a good 30 games or so before it started to click for me, and there are still games where I lose all focus!

	deanthebean: Thanks for the words of encouragement. I won't give up on it just yet. I hope you don't mind me playing on. It's obvious you will win but it's not yet obvious to me how you will do so. 
	Felix: No problem! Feel free to play me as much as you like. I can take it a bit easier on you next time, too :) But I think you can learn the most about this game by losing!
	Felix: And... that is how, haha. Watch out for those double eliminations with the large yellow sacrifices. They can be very dangerous!
	deanthebean: Wow. I did not see that coming! Well played. 
	Felix: Thanks, Good game! Feel free to play me again if you like.
	deanthebean: Thanks. I decided to find someone with a lower rating to practice against first :O
	Felix: Fair enough! The best way to learn though, is to play against better players and learn by losing against them!
	deanthebean: I'm sure you're right about that.
