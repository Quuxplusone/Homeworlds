14) cheinzmann: Trade G1 R1 Cheinzmann
	TwoShort: Check.

15) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort
	cheinzmann: Why can't I build a G2 ship in Grogg, and how do I attack if necessary?
	TwoShort: You can only build a ship of the same color as a ship you have in the system, (the star being green means you can grow there, but not that you can grow green).  To attack, you need access to red (a red ship or star) in a system containing a ship of mine, and a ship of yours as big as mine or bigger.  
  Finally, you ought to undo that move.  With 4 of the same color in a system, I can call a catastrophe and since it's your homeworld, and that's all that's there, you'll lose.  I said "Check" to indicate that I would win on the next turn if you didn't stop me.  Even with just 3 greens, I could sacrifice my y2 to move my g2 twice into your Homeworld to trigger the catastrophe.

16) cheinzmann: Build G2 Cheinzmann
	cheinzmann: thanks!
	cheinzmann: probably should have built a Y2

17) TwoShort: Sacrifice G3 Twoshort
Build G3 Twoshort
Build G3 Yolonda
Build G3 Twoshort
	TwoShort: Well, you probably shouldn't have moved your 3 pointer out of your Homeworld; typically, that never happens before you get another big piece.  If I get a piece in your Homeworld (like my g2), you need a piece the same size or bigger to attack it.  It's not threat this turn because I don't have a red of my own to sacrifice, so my g2 would just sit there.  In general, "Always have a 3 pointer at home" is one of the more bedrock maxims of Homeworlds strategy.

18) cheinzmann: Move G1 Cheinzmann Grogg
	TwoShort: So again I could blow up your greens in exchange for my y2 & g2.  But instead I'm going demonstrate a key tactic, called "the factory"...

19) TwoShort: Sacrifice Y2 Twoshort
Move G3 Yolonda Grogg
Move G2 Yolonda Grogg
Catastrophe Grogg Green
	cheinzmann: So by doing a sacrifice of you G3, you get 3 actions points then you built 3 ships with that.
	cheinzmann: I will read up on catastrophe not sure how it works. Let me try a smaller factory

20) cheinzmann: Trade G2 Y2 Cheinzmann

21) TwoShort: Trade G3 Y3 Twoshort
	TwoShort: Catastrophe:  At the end of your turn, if any system has 4 or more pieces of the same color (including both players ships and the star(s)) you can trigger a catastrophe, which removes all pieces of the relevant color from that system.  If one of the pieces was the (only) star, any remaining ships are going to go away too.  Despite red being "attack", causing catastrophes to blow up your opponents ships is frequently the dominant offensive mechanic of the game.
  For example... :)

22) cheinzmann: Build Y2 Cheinzmann
	cheinzmann: You forgot to say "This will hurt me a lot more than it does you".
