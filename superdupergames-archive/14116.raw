7) TwoShort: Trade G1 Y1 Twoshort
	TwoShort: In that case, I'll throw out a few strategy tips... As second player, you usually want a star of the size I didn't use so we're three hops from each other; this way we're two.  Also, most people think the 1-2 homeworld is best; I took the 1-3 homeworld partly to be nice :)
  Also, you usually want to start with a green ship.
	ExKirby: OK... do you know how to make a new system?

8) ExKirby: Discover Y1 Exkirby G2 Newstarname
