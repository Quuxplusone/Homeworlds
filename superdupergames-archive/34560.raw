Winner: dlwillson

1) Felix: H B3 Y2 G3

2) dlwillson: H Y3 R2 G3 *
	Felix: Hello again :) was this the game you wanted to try a yellow/red homeworld? If so, I can undo and try the same thing

3) Felix: Pass
	dlwillson: Uh, woops! I moved before reading! Yes, this is that game, and I forgot to mark it unranked so I'll probably be giving up a few points on the experiment. :-)
 
It's good to see you!

4) dlwillson: Build G1 Dlwillson
	Felix: I will happily drain one turn to offset your disadvantage!
 
Likewise. Always a pleasure. How did code camp go? Did that already happen?

5) Felix: B G1 Felix
	dlwillson: That kind of invalidates the test, but I'll take it, and we'll see what happens!
 
DevOps Camp went well. I haven't gone through the feedbacks yet, but from my perspective, it was surprisingly packed with good learning. So much Kubernetes, and way more AWS CloudFormation than I could possibly want, but the campers seemed happy with it.

	dlwillson: GG!
	dlwillson: Do you want to do this one again, but in a large universe? I think maybe the red/yellow system would be a worse problem in a larger universe.
	Felix: Oh wow, did not see that coming at ALL. Good move. I should have been a lot more careful. I was being too laidback this whole game :) I'm certainly game to do it again.
