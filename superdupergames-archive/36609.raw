	Babamots: Looks like you found the instructions. Let me know if you have any trouble figuring out how to make a move. The most nun-intuitive thing to me is that you have to put each sacrifice action and catastrophe on a new line.

	Babamots: I tried a homeworld setup without blue once, but I don't think it worked out. It's a pretty big handicap.

	Babamots: Sorry this wasn't going your way. I'll be available for a rematch later, though I'm focused on some life things for now.
