Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2006.1.25, Ended: 2006.1.31
Participants: Jesse (S), tendrecube (N)
Winner: Jesse

1) tendrecube: Homeworld Y2 B1 G3

2) Jesse: Homeworld Y3 B2 G3
	Jesse: Hello.  I see you have already been beaten up a bit by three of the stronger players on the server.  What I would like to do here is to give you a handicap to try to even the playing field a bit.  The way it works is, after I set up my homeworld, I'll pass a few times to give you a head start.  I've only just started experimenting with this, so I don't have a good idea of how many times to pass to make an interesting game.  Shall we try four?

3) tendrecube: Build G1 Tendrecube

4) Jesse: Pass
	tendrecube: well as you like....
I think i handle the rules...but still have some problems develloping a viable strategy...
Hard to hook player my place for this game...sigh..
 
Choose the number of turn you think you're rated for buddy.
I don't mind. I'm happy to play anyway :-)
 
Let's have some fun....

5) tendrecube: Build G1 Tendrecube
	Jesse: Well, that's the idea.  I don't actually know how many passes I can afford to give.  I'm trying to find that out.  If four turns out to be insane, then I won't give four anymore.

6) Jesse: Pass
	tendrecube: the advantage you give can turn to be an inconvenient for me....cause you'll have an easier acces to bigger pyramids from the reserves earlier
just a thought

7) tendrecube: Discover G1 Tendrecube Y3 Atomium
	Jesse: You will have access to them as well.  I'm quite sure it's not an advantage.

8) Jesse: Pass

9) tendrecube: Build G1 Atomium
	Jesse: One more pass to come...

10) Jesse: Pass

11) tendrecube: Trade G1 B1 Tendrecube
	Jesse: That's it.  Oh, man...  Do you hve any idea how hopeless this looks?

12) Jesse: Build G1 Jesse
	tendrecube: i can't see the hopeless this far lol
you feel so stuck with the limitation given by the rules..
That's where the fun comes ;-)

13) tendrecube: Discover G1 Atomium B1 Elfstar

14) Jesse: Build G2 Jesse
	Jesse: Don't misunderstand me.  I will enjoy the challenge of overcoming the advantage you have.  It's just a very difficult looking one.
	Jesse: I don't know if you play Go, but it's like the first time giving someone a nine stone handicap: very intimidating.

15) tendrecube: Trade G3 Y3 Tendrecube
	tendrecube: Oh that is an image i can clearly understand
 


16) Jesse: Trade G2 R2 Jesse
	tendrecube: wasn't it a win if i moved the little G one from Elfstar to your binary homeworld?
	tendrecube: oops said nothing...no propulsion technology there

	Jesse: Right, you could have destroyed me if you'd had propulsion available.

17) tendrecube: Move B1 Tendrecube Atomium

18) Jesse: Build G2 Jesse

19) tendrecube: Build B2 Atomium

20) Jesse: Trade G2 B2 Jesse

30) Jesse: Move B3 Khoomei Atomium

31) tendrecube: Sacrifice Y3 Tendrecube
Move B3 Elfstar Jesse
Move B2 Elfstar Jesse
Move B1 Paradise Jesse
Catastrophe Jesse B

32) Jesse: Move B3 Atomium Tendrecube
	Jesse: You will find that such a move is too aggressive, since it leaves you with no defenses of your own.

33) tendrecube: Build G1 Elfstar

34) Jesse: Sacrifice R2 Jesse
Attack G1 Tendrecube
Pass
	tendrecube: indeed it sounds aggressive...
I'm exploring the strategies..

	Jesse: Another thing is that you need to be aware of the red ships your opponent can sacrifice.  Anyway, thanks for the game.  Keep playing, you'll get a handle on it.
