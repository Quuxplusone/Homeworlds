6) zoltar: Trade G3 Y3 Zoltar

7) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

8) zoltar: Build Y2 Zoltar
	zoltar: I already feel like I have a big disadvantage on the second move.  You got to take the two smaller stars, and maybe I should have taken a medium and large because you now are getting medium yellows already, and switching to a big yellow ship means I'm likely to be destroyed by a catastrophe as in our previous game as I have a yellow star.  I suppose I'm safe to build more yellow until you get a large yellow, or if you get a medium yellow and move out your small yellow one step, but that could be two moves away, and then I'll have to change the color of my big ship again.  Is this normal, or have I lost a tempo or two?

14) zoltar: Trade G1 B1 Zoltar

15) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort
	TwoShort: Sorry, I somehow missed your questions until now.  The 1-2 homeworld is (I think) a very slight advantage.  You might have switched the colors of your stars to not deplete small yellows so far, but either way, I've got only a slight advantage by getting more twos than you, as long as you avoid getting locked out of yellow entirely, which you did.  For a really big advantage, I need to get more 3 pointers than you.  Your latest move means I can grow a Y3 at Grogar.  Then once I move one of the tyellows to a new star, I can sacrifice the g1 at yolonda to grow that y3 too, and then you'll really be in a bad way.  So I think you've been doing pretty much OK until this latest move... which I'd be happy to have you undo if you like.
	zoltar: Ok, thanks, I undid that.  Maybe I'll take some time and think about this, as I didn't see any of your analysis before I made the move.  I'm especially fuzzy on tactics that involves sacrifices and seeing the possibilities and outcomes.  I'll take a break and think and come back to it fresh this evening and see if I can find some better plan of action that doesn't give you the upper hand building the monster sized ships.

16) zoltar: Build B1 Zoltar
	zoltar: This is what I came up with.  By not building a yellow, you don't get the y3, but if I build a green, you could either sacrifice for a catastrophe or you could take the bigger greens by sacking your G3 and building both G2s and your G3 again; so if I trade for a blue, I avoid all of the above and have a new color I can build.  Getting a red didn't seem to be as important yet, so I got into the blue market.  I hope that is sound reasoning and I haven't blown it again.
	TwoShort: That's pretty good; another alternative would have been moving the g1 out, thus threatening to move into one of my systems and cause a catastrophe if I build too many greens.  As you've correctly noted, I'm threatening to set up a "factory" where I repeatedly sacrifice and re-grow the g3.  You probably can't stop that entirely, but if at all possible you want to force the tempo such that you get a g3 for your own factory too.

17) TwoShort: Build G2 Yolonda

18) zoltar: Trade Y3 G3 Zoltar
	zoltar: I seem to be doomed.  You can sac your G3 and then grow it back, plus another g2 in your homeworld and the last g3 in yolanda, giving you two green 'factories' and leaving me with only small greens.    Did I make a serious blunder, and if so, was there a defence?

19) TwoShort: Discover G1 Yolonda B2 Bluestar
	TwoShort: Well, I'd caution you against giving up too easily; comebacks are certainly possible in this game.  In any case, if you want good practice at seeing possibilities, try to see how long you can hold me off.  As for the current situation, you might consider flipping your y3 back to green;  it's hard to be inefficient that way, but you don't want to miss the factory boat.  Note that I don't dare grow 3 greens at Yolonda, because you could sacrifice your y2 to move in and cause a catastrophe there.  It would eventually be nice for you to have a green somewhere beyond your homeworld, so you could pose the same threat to my homeworld, without having to sacrifice your 3 (which you don't want to do except to get another or win).

20) zoltar: Discover G1 Zoltar B2 Blue2
	zoltar: Ok, I wouldn't have thought of that, but it makes sense.  I did see that if you get 3 greens I could sac my y2 if I ever got my green out of my homeworld, so perhaps that will do.  I understand the principle of the factory, but I don't quite get it.  I seem to have to have a g3 plus one other green ship at my 'factory' system, so that the other green can support my rebuilding the g3 after I make my other 2 builds.  Is that it, or is there more to it than that?

21) TwoShort: Trade Y2 R2 Twoshort
	TwoShort: That's it, except that the other green could be at a different system so that your g3 jumps there as part of the bargain.  Either way, you get two grows anywhere without giving anything up.

	TwoShort: Hmm, not sure why that happened


22) zoltar: Trade B1 R1 Zoltar

23) TwoShort: Sacrifice G3 Twoshort
Build G2 Bluestar
Build Y2 Grogar
Build G3 Twoshort
	zoltar: But even with a factory I can't grow a ship in a system without another ship of that color, right?  I just don't need any green in the system where I do one of the builds?
	TwoShort: Exactly.  Note that if you factory now, you won't be able to regrow the g3 in your homeworld, and it can be dangerous to leave your homeworld without a 3 pointer once your opponent has red.  Luckily, I don't want to factory this turn either, since I can only grow yellow & green, which would give you access to the Y3s. 

24) zoltar: Move B1 Zoltar Green2

25) TwoShort: Move Y2 Grogar Blue2
	zoltar: I assume that I must get a red ship here, even if only an itty-bitty one, so that you can't bully me by coming to any of my systems with any one of your ships and threatening to sac your red to take over my ships.
	TwoShort: Yeah, it's pretty much always a good idea to get a red ship if your opponent has one. 

26) zoltar: Trade B1 R1 Green2

27) TwoShort: Sacrifice G3 Twoshort
Build Y2 Blue2
Build Y3 Grogar
Build G3 Twoshort

28) zoltar: Build Y3 Green2
	zoltar: In another game against another beginner like myself, I got a red ship, my opponent ignored it, and the next move now I sacrificed my home Y3 ship to teleport my R3 from my homeworld into his, and I think that there is no defence, as with even an R1 anywhere, he could have defended by sacking the  R1 and taking my ship in his homeworld, but now if he trades for a red ship, I can just capture it on my move.  What a powerful weapon, even a single unopposed red ship!

29) TwoShort: Sacrifice G2 Yolonda
Build G2 Bluestar
Build Y3 Blue2
	TwoShort: Yeah, Ocasionally you get a situation where you can ignore your opponent having taken red for a turn or two because they can't reach you, but you've got to be careful; as you say, if they attack, it will be too late.
	TwoShort: Oh, you don't want to do that...  I can sacrifice my y2 to move two gs into your homeworld for a catastrophe.  I'm not entirely sure what you should do instead, but note that it's pretty unlikely I'll sacrifice to attack the g1 if you leave it at Blue2; for reasons just discussed, I don't want to be without red while you have one, and a 2 pointer sac for just a 1 pointer isn't that great a trade in any case.  I wanted to spread the yellows out for growing options; being randomly threatening by moving into your system was just a side bonus :)

30) zoltar: Discover Y2 Green2 B3 Blue3
	zoltar: Ok, I didn't see that.  I wanted a factory!  But I can't build a Y2, or you use the factory to instantly get both Y3s.  I am doomed already it seems.

31) TwoShort: Sacrifice Y3 Blue2
Move G1 Bluestar Zoltar
Move G2 Bluestar Zoltar
Move G2 Bluestar Zoltar
Catastrophe Zoltar Green

32) zoltar: Move R1 Zoltar Green2
	zoltar: Again, you are getting 2 ships for every one of mine...
	TwoShort: Well, to be frank, you are probably doomed.  It's definitely a deep game that rewards experience, which I've got lots of.

	zoltar: Yeah, I knew that, but I resigned too early last game, so I want to see how you force the win.  I just realized you could sac your Y3 and wipe out my greens any time you want, for starters.
	zoltar: Oops, that wasn't very smart... D'oh!
Play again?
	TwoShort: Weird; it really shouldn't let you do that.
	zoltar: Not only does it let you do that, but it doesn't allow a take-back either.  A pathetic way to die!
