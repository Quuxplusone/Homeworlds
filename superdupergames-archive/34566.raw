Catastrophe Eden Green
	eliscinsky: So let me get this right.  In the Eden system I have the TRADE economy, and you being in the system can also use "my" trading ability?
	Babamots: No, I can't trade in Eden anymore. But I could trade in Eden on my last turn because my ship was blue.
	Babamots: For a "free" (non-sacrifice) action you can only use the powers of your own ships and of the system marker(s).
	eliscinsky: Okay, I see. I was over looking that your ship WAS a blue to start. Thanks for the clarification.

58) eliscinsky: Attack G1 Babamots

	eliscinsky: PASS! But we could have gone on for at least 3-4 rounds. :-D
	Babamots: It was getting depressing :-P.
	Babamots: Well played. You saw your chance and didn't hesitate.
	eliscinsky: I CANNOT  BELIEVE I WON! WA-HOO! (sorry)
You're my 1st (true) win, ever. Hmmm makes me wonder.  But what a confidence boost. Thank you so much for the game. Good luck in the finals of the tournament.  I'm sure you'll do well there.
 
So in terms of scoring, do I get bonus points for beating someone who has beaten so many others?  Kind of like HS Football, where the winning team gets points for the win, AND gets a bonus point for each team the loser has beaten.  Just thinking.
	Babamots: In the tournament rules, it says each win has equal weight. In the registration survey, I suggested using PageRank for scoring (which would give more weight to wins against strong opponents like you suggest), but quite a few people didn't like that idea. Now if I lose to Felix, there's likely to be a two- or even three-way tie for high score. You've put the pressure on me!
 
I feel pretty silly for losing that way, but I'm also kind of glad for you. It's nice to get an unexpected win. Go ahead and revel.
	Draw5PlayAll: So if there is a tie then we should have a showdown round robin among the tied players. All games must be played simultaneously. Muha.
