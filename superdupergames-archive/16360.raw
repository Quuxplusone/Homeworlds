	ZackStack: Well... I wondered if you'd try mutual annihilation last turn (I have yet to see what SDG makes of that... :-)

Catastrophe Goulo Green
	goulo: Wow, you are totally kicking my butt...! Thanks for the lesson in the power cycling through greens... :)
	ZackStack: You bet! ;-)  Big green ships are pretty darn awsome!

	goulo: Thanks! I will try another game with you when I am more of a challenge for you. :)
	ZackStack: I look forward too it!  Or I'd be happy to play an unrated challenge if you think you can learn from more games but are worried about your rating.
	goulo: I'm not worried about my rating. I prefer playing rated games, whether against weaker, stronger, or same-strength players, so that there is more data in the ratings pool and the ratings become more accurate. :)
