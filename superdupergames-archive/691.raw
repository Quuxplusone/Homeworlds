Participants: Jesse (S), TwoShort (N)
Winner: Jesse

1) TwoShort: Homeworld B2 Y1 G3
Jesse: In the beginning, the heavens were without substance or form, except for having maybe a few stars in the background for interest, and being neatly divided into parcels ten trillion cubits to a side.
Jesse: Other than that, you know, nothing.
TwoShort: homeworld b2 y1 g3

2) Jesse: Homeworld Y2 B3 G3
TwoShort: then suddenly... stuff!

3) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

4) Jesse: Build G1 Jesse
Jesse: Yes, two great civilizations arose. Was it a quantum fluctuation? One civilization and its anticivilization? Whyfor is the symmetry breaking between them? We know not, but that it is believed by many to be the miracle of homeworldogensis.

TwoShort: I've read and thought about Homeworlds quite a bit. Many years ago I lived in DC and hung out with the Wunderland crowd. I still follow Andys website, and I was intrigud when he raved about binary homeworlds. I'm a big fan of pure strategy games, but the rest of my current gaming crew are not, so I haven't gotten to actually play much before. So you should probably expect some mix of smart moves and really stupid mistakes...

38) Jesse: Trade R1 Y1 Jesse

39) TwoShort: Move G2 Yellonia Jesse
TwoShort: As long as we're seeing what turns out to be foolish...

40) Jesse: Attack G2N Jesse
Jesse: Yes, that's definitely a stong attack option. There's not much I can do except capture your piece and let you destroy my large defender, without losing a large of your own.

41) TwoShort: Sacrifice G1 Oldyeller
Build B2 Bluto
Jesse: However, I think if you do that, I can leave you crippled.
TwoShort: I think I'm doomed unless I can press the attack home in short order. Which I don't think I can do. But let's try this...

42) Jesse: Sacrifice G2 Jesse
Build Y2 Zuban
Build Y3 Triffid

43) TwoShort: Sacrifice G2 Yellonia
Build R1 Twoshort
Build R3 Bluto
Jesse: It would probably have been better to trade r2->y2 at bluto first, so you could have built the y3 yourself when you did that sacrifice action.
Jesse: Hmm, then again...
Jesse: I think I can weather that storm. Hmm...

44) Jesse: Sacrifice Y2 Zuban
Move Y2 Triffid Twoshort
Move Y3 Triffid Twoshort
Catastrophe Twoshort Y
Jesse: Ooh, the storm is more severe than I thought. :D
Jesse: Ah, but it's stalled harmlessly out at sea.

45) TwoShort: Trade R2 Y2 Twoshort
TwoShort: Fortune strums a weary tune for he whose campaign peaks too soon.

46) Jesse: Move G3 Zuban Twoshort
TwoShort: I suppose I could resign at this point; it's only a question of how long I can delay the inevitable

47) TwoShort: Sacrifice Y2 Twoshort
Move R3 Bluto Jesse
Move R2 Bluto Jesse
Catastrophe Jesse Red
Jesse: Not very long, I think, but I've been surprized before.
Jesse: As for campaigns peaking, I've definitely found that attacking before you're sure you can drive the victory home often ends in defeat.
TwoShort: When in doubt, my instincts are certainly skewed toward offense; which as I suspected, did not serve me well, since you were able to keep diffusing my threats while getting stronger, until I was finally left thrashing in futility. Speaking of which, I can stop you from using red like this...

48) Jesse: Trade G3 B3 Twoshort
TwoShort: But I still see how you can win unstopably on the turn after this one.

49) TwoShort: Sacrifice B2 Bluto
Trade R1 G1 Twoshort
Trade R1 Y1 Twoshort
Jesse: Actually, there is a way for you to delay it one more move. It is rather pointless, but see if you can find it anyway. :)
Jesse: Great game by the way. Thanks!

50) Jesse: Sacrifice G2 Zuban
Build B2 Twoshort
Build B2 Twoshort
Catastrophe Twoshort B
TwoShort: But TwoShort is a peaceful planet! We have no weapons...
TwoShort: oops, didn't see your chalenge of finding the way to delay before I went for the dumb Star Wars joke... let's see
TwoShort: Ahh, I could have sacrificed my small green to grow blue at bluto, but not called catastrophe. Oh well, at least I got in a dumb Star Wars joke.

TwoShort: And yes, great game!
Jesse: Right! Of course, then I trade my y3 for r3, call the ctastrophe myself, and either blow you up or take your ships on the next turn.
Jesse: I don't usually blow up my opponents' homeworlds, but...
