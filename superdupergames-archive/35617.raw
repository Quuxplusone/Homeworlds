	Babamots: We are playing with "undo" available. If you decide you didn't like your move, you can go back to the game page and hit the "Undo Last Move" button. This only works once, though. If you undo a move and make another move, you can't undo the second one.
	capi3101: Ah. I'll keep that in mind.

Got a problem now, don't I?

33) Babamots: Trade G3 Y3 Bolarus

34) capi3101: Discover G2 Advorsus R2 Desperata
	Babamots: Yeah, you have a bit of a problem. I'm not sure where things went wrong either. I'll have to look back at the game archive.

	Babamots: Uh oh, it looks like you forgot about red sacrifices. I can sacrifice a red ship to capture your r3. Would you like to undo and pick a different move?
 
It's kind of a strange mechanic since a single red ship can simultaneously deter attacks in every system. "A red anywhere is a red everywhere."
	Babamots: I got nosey and read some of your conversation in an old game with wil. I also got the pieces in the "Martian Chess Set." I read the rules for Homeworlds when they came out, and liked it in theory but I couldn't find opponents. I was at LooneyCon when I heard that SDG had an active HW community, so I got in here and taught them their business ;-).
 
I hope you love playing on here as much as I have.
	capi3101: Yeah, I suppose I'll undo. Was paying attention to your double yellow and the two reds you captured not too far back...
	capi3101: The game with wil wrapped up yesterday; that one was definitely an exercise in "it's been far long since the last time I played"...
	capi3101: Not doing too much better this game...

42) capi3101: Trade G3 Y3 Capi3101

43) Babamots: Sacrifice G3 Advorsus
Build Y2 Babamots
Build G3 Bolarus
Build G3 Advorsus
	Babamots: I've got checkmate in two moves if you're not careful here. Can you see the problem? I'll give you a hint if you want it.
	capi3101: Let's see if I can spot it...
The sac of the Y3 in Bolarus moves the small green from Andoria and the Y2 in Advorsus to my homeworld, blowing green and leaving me with just the dinky little red ship there.
	capi3101: If I grow Red at my homeworld, the sac of the Y2 at Bolarus moves your two red ships in and blows them up.
	capi3101: Swapping the large ship at my homeworld for a different color seems the best move to move.
	capi3101: On the other hand, that puts a fresh large green in the market.
	capi3101: Hell...

44) capi3101: Attack G1 Andoria
	capi3101: May have only bought myself a move or two at most.
	Babamots: I think you made your best move just now. It'll be a bit of a chore for me to either build up enough blue to catastrophe your star or enough yellow to catastrophe your y3.
 
My preferred win is to invade with so many large ships that my opponent's biggest red sacrifice can't take them all, but that will never work while you have an r3.

45) Babamots: Sacrifice G3 Advorsus
Build B1 Babamots
Build R2 Advorsus
Build G3 Advorsus

46) capi3101: Trade R3 Y3 Andoria
	capi3101: Running low on materiel...I have an idea of what i want to do; question is going to be whether I've got time to pull it off.

47) Babamots: Sacrifice Y2 Babamots
Move G2 Advorsus Capi3101
Move G3 Advorsus Capi3101

48) capi3101: Attack G3 Capi3101
	Babamots: I'm afraid you won't have enough time to get the red and yellow you need. My invasion starts on my next move.
 
I only plan to destroy your stars. Your ships and crews will not be harmed.
	Babamots: Your defeated crews will, of course, be treated humanely. :-)

Move G1 Advorsus Capi3101
Catastrophe Capi3101 G
Move B3 Babamots Capi3101
	capi3101: Hmm...
	capi3101: I could let you end it all on the next turn. But let's play it out a tad.

50) capi3101: Sacrifice Y3 Andoria
Move G1 Andoria Babamots
Move G2 Desperata Babamots
Move G2 Desperata Babamots

	capi3101: I won't get to keep it, of course.

Catastrophe Capi3101 B

	capi3101: Not that that does me any good...
 
Where did I go wrong, you think? Did I move out of my home system too quickly?
	Babamots: You're quite right. Some people say "red alert" when their opponent is a move from elimination, but I usually don't. It seems more like taunting than being helpful, especially when they don't have a way out.
	Babamots: I'll look back at the game history and give you some analysis. Do you know how to switch to the archive view and see earlier game states?
	Babamots: Here's a Javascript that switches your SDG view. There are instructions for turning it into a bookmark.

	Babamots: You were keeping up just fine until your 9th move. Then you spent a move on trying to be aggressive by moving a g1 to join my pair of g2s. I traded g2 for r2. This did three things:
1) It defended against your invasion since you couldn't cause an advantageous catastrophe anymore.
2) It created a threat since I could attack you.
3) It was a developmental move that I might have made even if you hadn't tried to invade. It got me my first red ship, and you needed to get a red in response soon.
 
On your 10th move, you traded y3 for g3. This is a little dangerous since you have a green star in your home. It turns into a problem much later and you have to trade that g3 for r3 to avoid catastrophe. My suggestion would have been trading y1 for r1. This would have given you access to every technology at home, and you could have sacrificed the r1 to attack me if I tried to invade Advorsus.
 
On your 11th move you traded y2 for r2. It was important for you to get a red ship somewhere soon to dissuade me from invading Advorsus, but you traded away the only yellow ship you had in that system. That's one less system in which you can build yellow.
 
On your 14th move, you built g2. This set me up to do my green sacrifice and score a g3 two moves later. You could have discouraged this on your 15th move by trading a g2 for another color (I suggest yellow). Then the stash would have had an additional g2 and I couldn't have built the g3 right away. It may seem silly to build a ship only to trade it for another color, but since building y2 wasn't an option (a y1 was in the stash), trading for a y2 isn't a bad idea at all. It's common to use the most-used color (green) as a shortcut to larger pieces in other colors. I'll be doing this on my 17th and 18th moves.
 
On your 16th move, you trade away your only yellow at home. There's only one system where you can build yellow now.
 
On my 19th move, I invaded Advorsus. You had lots of ships there and you couldn't evacuate them all. You didn't have a large ship to defend them, and you didn't have a green ship there that you could use to catastrophe my large. Ideally, you would have had a second colony (like my Andoria and Bolarus) so that
1) It would have been easier to build many ships without danger of overpopulation.
2) If I invaded either colony, there would only be half as many ships to capture.
 
You do a fairly good job of responding to my invasion. You try to sacrifice away medium ships on your 19th and 20th moves. It might have been better to sacrifice the y2 to move your r2 and g2 to two (different) new systems so I could only capture smalls.
 
At this point, I have a good fleet on your doorstep and quite a bit of yellow. It's pretty hard to come back from that.
