19) zoltar: Sacrifice R1 Zoltar
Attack R2 Greenhills
	zoltar: This is another case where you should undo this move. Note that I can simply sacrifice my R1 in the zoltar homeworld and by doing so, capture your R2 in greenhills, which essentially trades my R1 for an R1 and destroys your R2, making the move doubly bad for you. Remember that a sacrificed piece gives you that color's power in any star system. It's as if by sacrificing my R1, the star in greenhills becomes a red star for that turn.
	zoltar: I meant to say "trades my R1 for an R2". Note that a single R1 anywhere protects all my ships everywhere from an attack of ships the same size. That's why it's always important to have one red ship once your opponent gets red ships, but having more than one isn't as important for defence.

	Papipo: I must play more times :]
