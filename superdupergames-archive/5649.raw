	Keith: Hello Preacher,
Let me know if you have any questions as the game progresses.

3) Preacher: Build G1 Preacher

4) Keith: Build G1 Keith
	Preacher: I will, Keith.  This is my very first go at this one (i am in another game but awaiting my first turn).  I've read the rules - of course :) - multiple times.  Also, I found some strategy articles at the wiki sites last night that i read through.  Additionally, I followed the log of one of your games where you were teaching a fella to play.  All those things have been very helpful ... I think :).
	Keith: You have certainly done a more extensive preparation for your first game than most have.  This game will help clarify what you have read.

5) Preacher: Trade G1 B1 Preacher

6) Keith: Trade G1 Y1 Keith

7) Preacher: Discover B1 Preacher G3 Orion

8) Keith: Build Y1 Keith
	Keith: So what happens if I build and take the last y1?  How do you develop yellow pieces?
	Preacher: Trade in other pieces for yellow, I think.  Aren't you in the same situation re: blue? (??) :)
	Keith: Yes to trading and yes I am in the same situation.

	Keith: You seem to have a better grasp of the game than most first time players.  You avoid dangerous buildups of one color in a system, avoid getting locked out of a color, and manipulate the stash to your advantage.

	Keith: I was going to undo my move.
	Preacher: can i undo and then you undo?
	Keith: Lets try it.
	Preacher: now you try
	Keith: That worked.  I can make a different move now but we are limited to one undo each so you can't undo the g3 move.

51) Preacher: Build Y2 Preacher

52) Keith: Move Y1 Keith Midworld
	Keith: I am attempting to enter the following order:
sacrifice y2 midworld
move r1 keith midworld
move r1 keith orion
catastrophe orion red
I get an error that I do not own an R1 in keith.
	Aaron: once you move the r2 from keith to midworld you no longer have an r1 in keith.  I assume one of those r1's needs to be an r2.
	Aaron: once you move the r1 from keith, that is.
	Keith: Doh!  User error.  Sorry for the interruption Aaron.  Thanks.
