1) Felix: Homeworld B3 R2 G3
	haymire: Hello mate, this is my first game of Homeworlds, I will learn as I play.
	haymire: Hello mate, this is my first game of Homeworlds, I will learn as I play.
	Felix: Welcome! I hope you have fun. I hope you learn a lot too, and don't hesitate to ask me if you have any questions!

2) haymire: Homeworld R3 B1 G3
	haymire: Having a bit of trouble with inputting my commands, errors keep popping up.
I want my Homeworld to be R3, B1, with a ship G3. What do I need to type?

3) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	Felix: Oops, sorry. It didn't notify me of your message so I didn't see it till now. Looks like you figured it out though! It can take bit of trial and error to figure out the command inputs. You can also just type the first letter of your command. So you could type "H R3 B1 G3" instead of "Homeworld R3 B1 G3." Same goes for other commands like build.

12) haymire: Build G1 Haymire
	Felix: If there's only small left of a particular color that you don't have yet, it's best to try to trade for it if possible. Otherwise it becomes more difficult to get that color. For instance, I just took the last small blue, and you have no medium ships to trade for blue currently, so you either must wait until you have a medium, or you must trade your large for blue, neither of which is an ideal situation.
	haymire: Okay, I thought the build action was any colour of a ship or the star system its at.

13) Felix: Discover B1 Felix G1 Orchid
	Felix: Ah, no. That's a mistake I made early on, too. You must actually control a ship of a color in order to build that color, I'm afraid.

	Felix: Good game! You had me worried for a minute. Very well played. I'd love to play again any time!
	haymire: 'ANNIHILATION OF ALL OPPOSITION' lol that's nice, it was only my first game. 
Yeah that was fun, could do a re-match.
Any advice for me to improve?

	haymire: Good game, well played
	Felix: Hmm... I'll try to provide tips as I think of them in our second game. Just try to diversify your colors as much as possible. Try not to get locked out of any color, and try not to have more than 2 of a color in any system, if possible, at least not for more than a turn and only if you know you'll be safe that turn. Also, it feels good to be aggressive and try to cause a catastrophe any time it's possible, but it can also leave you vulnerable to a counterattack, which is what happened here. Sometimes it's wiser to build up your forces first and wait to attack until you're sure you can finish the opponent off. Finally, you might have a bit more luck if you start with the "banker" formation for your home world. A small and medium of yellow and blue with a large green ship is generally considered the best starting set up for beginners.
