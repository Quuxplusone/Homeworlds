7) phi_618: Build Y2 Phi_618
	Trydnt: there were only 2 y1s available. if you didn't take it the I would swap for y. if you then did not swap for y1 you would not be able to get into the yellow economy as I'd take the other y1. you'd have wasted a move swapping for any other color as you'd have to switch to y1 after I did to avoid a lockout

	phi_618: Is it that big a deal that half my homeworld is destroyed? Yeah, I'm easier to attack, but I'm also closer to your homeworld, so it seems like it would be a wash. And I now have move technology back online and the only medium (for now), so it seems like I have compensation?
