Winner: ajo

1) caru: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3
	ajo: This will be my first-ever three-player game of Homeworlds on SDG. Am I correct in assuming that since the "Variants" on this match don't include "Sinister", it's a "last man standing" sort of thing?
	ajo: ...self-correction: it's a "first to get someone else out" sort of thing. Right?

2) ajo: Homeworld R1 B2 G3
	Danner: "The standard end-of-game condition is Last Man Standing" :)

3) BloodRumpus: Homeworld R2 B3 G3
	ajo: Thanks, Danner. I was thrown off by the fact that in the first couple of multiplayer non-Sinister archive games I looked at, the games ended with multiple homeworlds still on the map and unconquered. But on closer inspection I see that those players had already resigned. Makes sense now.
