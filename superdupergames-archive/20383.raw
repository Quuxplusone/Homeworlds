	goulo: I didn't anticipate that you might build g2 at your homeworld, so I'm improvising. :)
	Subhan64: not a bad improvisation, I had slightly miscalculated on my plans as well!


	Subhan64: good game, thanks!
	goulo: thanks, that was a good game indeed! Very tense race at the finish. I had a strong adrenalin sense of "is now the time to pull the trigger and make the final homeworld attack? or am I overlooking something?" Good interesting tension!
 
A turn earlier I was tempted to send my G3 to your homeworld, then realized you had one response that would let you win first. So I built another ship, then sent it the turn later, and was promptly surprised by your building a green at your homeworld, which I'd not considered. But it turned out lucky for me that that didn't work for you. :)
	Subhan64: yeah, I think if I had moved the Y2 home before making the trade for R1 I could have pulled it out, at least for a while, as I could then either have constructed another g ship or traded for 1, & catastrophed all the green out of the sytem.  Would have left me pretty week

	Subhan64: & if you'd delayed a turn on moving into my home system I'd have been in yours, & the race would have been on!

	goulo: yep, it was a question of delicate timing! it felt oddly like an endgame in Cannon when one decides it's time to ignore the threat against one's own town and race for the enemy town instead because one will win the race by a move.
