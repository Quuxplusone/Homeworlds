	Felix: Some general tips to get started with:
Starting with a large green ship is a good idea, and having blue and yellow as your starting homeworld colors is also great. As a beginner, it's easiest to also start with small and medium homeworld pieces, as this allows you to access large pieces more quickly from the beginning.
	Felix: You typically don't need to bother with red at the beginning, but focus on building up your fleet of ships as fast as possible. Try to get the best ships you can without letting me get them. And diversify your colors as soon as possible, trying to rarely have three of the same color in a system if possible (and definitely never have four, because I could call catastrophe and blow them up!)
 
If your opponent gets a red ship, however, you should also try to get at least one as soon as possible so you aren't defenseless if they move in to attack.
	Felix: Also remember that if you sacrifice a ship for actions, you can use those actions in any system, so you don't necessarily have to have a red ship in a system, for instance, in order to attack. You could sacrifice your red elsewhere and still attack in a different system, so long as you had a ship there big enough to successfully attack. Make sense?

25) Felix: Move B2 Spark Ugoggino
	Felix: Good move to blow up half my system, but also dangerous. You now only have small ships in your home system, so it is vulnerable to attack. You should try to always have a large ship at home if possible.

26) ugoggino: Sacrifice Y1 Ugoggino
Move B3 Vega Felix
	ugoggino: why didn't you move r3 to my homesystem? 

27) Felix: S R3 Spark

	Felix: I wanted to be able to sacrifice  my red in order to capture all of your ships at once. You can sacrifice her read in another system and text chips and a different system. So if you had build another ship in your system, I could have sacrificed my large red and used my blue medium to attack all of your pieces at once
	Felix: Sorry, speech to text is not much good. I  meant if you can sacrifice a red in one system and attack ships in a different system 
	Felix: Like that. Not bad and good game!
	ugoggino: thank you, I've got much to understand and learn
	Felix: No problem. It takes a few games to get a handle on the strategy, but I'm happy to help you learn! Feel free to challenge me as many times as you wish.
