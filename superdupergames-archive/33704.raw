	wil: There was a 9 minute window for the slaughter...whew.

	wil: lol...well that proves I should have done the other move...nice!

	wil: all three of my choices have a winning response from your side...good game!
	Trydnt: in answer to your previous question... self taught haha
	Trydnt: the short universe is very fun though. completely changes the game
	wil: And it isn't a shorter game...  being able to play here has been handy..  It was almost the only way to find people to play... for a while I had somebody nearby who would play 3-5 games a night...but he moved away... so I only now get in a few games a week..  btw, you should be in the next tourney
	Trydnt: Haha yeah I miss our live games it's not the same here. but yeah it was interesting having to move out to build up forces so you couldn't just move straight in and blow it all up
