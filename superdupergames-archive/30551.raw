	orangeblood: Hi! It's time to play again, because my Pyramid Arcade kickstarter should arrive this week (hopefully). I need to re-learn the game so I can more easily teach others. The only two games I've ever played are with you, and it's been awhile.
	Felix: Welcome back! I'm happy to help you brush up on your skills before your Arcade arrives. I didn't realize they were arriving so soon. I hope mine arrives this week as well!

5) Felix: Trade G1 Y1 Felix
	orangeblood: Trying to follow the Kickstarter updates... it's not clear they have actually shipped U.S. orders yet. Someone said they might ship Thursday. Where do you live? I'm near D.C.
	Felix: I'm in NC. I think I remember them saying they should arrive by Nov 3 at the latest for US residents. Here's hoping it's sooner!

	Draw5PlayAll: Was Homeworlds the first game you tried out?

24) orangeblood: Move Y2 Orangeblood Bevo
	orangeblood: Homeworlds is the only pyramid game I've ever played, and only here at SDG. I am going to play F2F with one of my co-workers this week, however. I need to learn some of the other games. :)
	Draw5PlayAll: Felix?
	Felix: @orangeblood There's some great games in there. I am really enjoying Petal Battle at the moment. Good luck getting people hooked on it!
 
@Draw5 - no, my first play was Treehouse, and then IceDice. I didn't play homeworlds until I had a bigger set of pyramids.

25) Felix: Build Y3 Ralston

32) orangeblood: Build G3 Wishbone
	orangeblood: I'm just sort of flailing about, haha.
	Felix: Haha, no worries. It may have been a bad idea to trade away your G ship in your home system. It's better to try to build another G first before trading. That's a good rule of thumb for any color, really. Always better to build a second ship of any color and THEN trade that for a different ship. Otherwise you are losing one color ability to gain another, and it's not really a net gain.

33) Felix: Build G3 Bazoik

34) orangeblood: Build R1 Orangeblood
	orangeblood: Makes sense!
 
Got to play a 3-player World War 5 game today... and it was a lot of fun. More strategy than I thought.
	Felix: That's a game I'd like to see on SDG someday! I still haven't played yet.

35) Felix: Sacrifice G3 Felix

	Draw5PlayAll: While we are at it I would like to see Zark City here.
	Draw5PlayAll: And RAMbots.

36) orangeblood: Discover Y3 Orangeblood B3 Santorini
	orangeblood: Finally got to teach Homeworlds to a co-worker today... first f2f game ever. Lots of fun. Also tried Hijinks, which was way better than I thought it would be. Color Wheel, on the other hand... well, I'm not a big fan of puzzles. :)
	orangeblood: Also, you may have noticed my attempt at the investment/banker strategy this game was.... suboptimal.

37) Felix: Move Y1 Flemoid Bazoik
	Felix: My wife and I played hijinks and quite enjoyed it! Deceptively complex for such a seemingly simple game.
 
And yeah... the investment/banking is tough to pull off! I have rarely done it successfully. Good attempt though!

	orangeblood: Well played!
	orangeblood: Anyway, mission accomplished for me to brush up on the rules. I've already taught Homeworlds to a friend with the PA set. Thanks again!
	Felix: Thank you! Well played yourself. Glad to help you brush up!
