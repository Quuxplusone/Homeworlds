	wil: Well welcome to the fray!  I didn't like the four way because two people were inherently 1 star away...so glad you all started this one up...it is my first time in a three way battle for the universe and I intend to enjoy annihilation...

5) Aristos: Build Y1 Aristos

6) wil: Build G1 Wil
	Aristos: I've only played one previous more-than-two-player game, so this will be novel -- especially as that last one ended in a "withdraw due to failure to play in time" by two of my three opponents.
	wil: yeah....that sucks...can't find time to make a move in 5 days??  watsup widat?

21) wil: Discover B1 Wil G2 G2

22) Marmalade: Trade B2 R2 Bigpointything
	Aristos: As I said, this is my first multiplayer game... I find myself having trouble contemplating moves that Wil would never play against me 1-on-1 because it would give me too much advantage, but because I'm not the next player are fine because Marmalade takes advantage instead of me.  Tricky.
	wil: you underestimate my stupidity...

23) Aristos: Discover B2 Aristos G1 Ping

24) wil: Build B2 G2
	Aristos: You named a star system G2? That's just evil. At least it is a green size 2 star. Had you named a Y3 as G2... hm... as a strategy, that's worth considering... :-)

25) Marmalade: Build B2 Bigpointything

26) Aristos: Build Y1 Aristos
	wil: ah...I do it out of convenience...evil is making us type some long convoluted made up name for star systems...but i definetly like the idear of naming them what they are not...you've put it out in the universe expect it in a star near you soon!   Btw...I was in one 4 person game and it was PAINFUL how slow play went and the game eventually died...I absolutely appreciate the responsiveness of you both...it makes it fun.  Gotta find someone to make an app, I'd be blown away to see this in real time.

27) wil: Trade B2 R2 G2
	Marmalade: This is the longest-lasting multiplayer game I've had on this site...
	wil: Wow, that is awful...14 moves in 9 days and that is the longest??

28) Marmalade: Trade B2 Y2 Bigpointything

29) Aristos: Move Y1 Aristos Ping

36) wil: Trade Y2 B2 Wil

37) Marmalade: Discover B2 Bigpointything G2 Floop
	Aristos: We aim to please. 

38) Aristos: Build Y2 Aristos

39) wil: Build B3 G2
	Aristos: I'm trying to figure out how afraid to be of BigPointyThing. In a two-player game, I'd have to worry about his those yellow ships jumping into my homeworld or into Ping in short order, but in the three-player, it seems like either move would leave Marmalade and me totally at the mercy of wil. Weird balance of power. 

40) Marmalade: Build B3 Bigpointything
	Marmalade: I'm having the same issue. It's a lot harder to judge this in free-for-all. I suspect that Homeworlds multiplayer is best with the sinister variant (i.e., attack left), but we'll see how this goes.
	wil: BUUWAAHHAAAHAAAA

41) Aristos: Sacrifice Y2 Aristos
Move Y1 Spark G2
Move Y1 Ping G2
Catastrophe G2 Yellow
	wil: I'm actually just totally confused...  I enjoy being able to play with you two...hope I can put up a good game.  I think I'll realy have to set this one up at home.   I say however it turns out, we reboot it switching homeworlds and keep playing the same game from different seats to see the variances...

42) wil: Trade B3 Y3 G2
	Aristos: Ok. You both took B3s without leaving one for me. Therefore, one of you must suffer. I will either remove all yellows in G2 or all yellows in BigPointyThing. Please make your case as to why you are the lesser threat and I need to go after your opponent. You have a couple hours, maybe even until dawn, before I flip a coin.

43) Marmalade: Build B3 Floop
	Aristos: Decided not to wait... Finally decided to take out G2 on the grounds that wil has no yellow remaining so the loss was more devastating. If I am going to "use up" my fire power on one opponent, it seemed to make the most sense to go after the one that would be most devastated. Sorry, wil. I just felt threatened by two strong opponents. I may pay for this zealotry... I've left Marmalade rather well positioned.

	Aristos: Typed in the wrong slot. 
 
I attacked Wil earlier. Now, I balanced the scales of justice... I took out the same number of ships, even. 
 
What was that about itty bitty living spaces? :-) 

56) Aristos: Trade R1 B1 Aristos
	wil: I'm not quite understanding the logic...you knocked out two of my ships at a cost of 3 of yours, spent another three to knock out two of Marmalades...has the aggresiveness paid off?

57) wil: Discover Y1 G2 G1 G1
	Marmalade: "Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake."
	Aristos: Has the aggressiveness paid off? I don't know. I'm still figuring out all the levers that I have to play with in a 3-way game. 

58) Marmalade: Build B2 Marmalade

	wil: we are at 30 moves the equivalaent of 20 in a binary game...

64) Marmalade: Build Y3 Floop
	Aristos: Levers? Well, take a look at my position. It's a disaster in a two player game. But neither of you can really afford to commit enough forces to truly knock me out of the game without leaving yourself too weak once it is a two-player match. Oh, you could hit me, sure, just like I've hit both of you, but taking me out requires a bigger slice of forces. I find that interesting. It means that in a three-player game, there are tactical options that are suicidal in a two-player game -- which I would have guessed before the game started, but I am surprised how far I have pushed that.

Attack R1E Fluff
Attack R1E Fluff
	Aristos: Why did I attack? Because it was pretty much the only move I had... all others were suicide. 
	Aristos: In case you didn't know (because I didn't and had to go find out) in a multiplayer game, to attack you have to specify which opponent's ship. So the command I just did was:
     attack b1N Fluff
The "N" specifies "North".

80) Aristos: Pass
	wil: Now we know, you just like to attack.  But for future reference, it is at the top of our page... "the attack command. In this case, the ship must also be specified as belonging to a particular player by appending that player's seat designation (eg. G2S, B1E)."

94) Marmalade: Move R2 Marmalade Pong
	wil: The way these games play out sure is interesting...you always have to look behind your back...I like it a lot better than four players and while it will get to two at sometime, I have a feeling that when it makes it to two....the game is essentially over.   As I see it the game is to not anihilate another, but be in a position to take over their homeworld and quickly take over one or more of their star systems.
	wil: I wish there was an 'online' light on our names, so we would know who is there and if a move was to happen to hang around..

95) Aristos: Move Y3 Flash Pong
	Aristos: Wil: I started with a similar hypothesis, but I'm not sure it is supported by this game.
 
That hypothesis suggests that at some point, one player will make a tragic mistake and you just need to have an armada built up so you can trivially take advantage of that mistake and attack your remaining opponent in a single turn. Let's call it the "lurker hypothesis". 
 
My current hypothesis is that I think *both* of you have a short term goal to remove me from the board, rather than waiting for me to make a mistake. After that, you'll then play a robust two-player game. Call it the "joint strike hypothesis". 
 
Here's my argument...
 
I attacked both of you early on. That action was predicated on the idea that neither of you could afford to actually take me out without leaving yourselves vulnerable. I thought maybe an early strike would put me in a beneficial position later on. 
 
Clearly it did not leave me in a good position. I was wrong there. But I am still alive because it is expensive for you to take me out. That would seem to support the lurker hypothesis.
 
But in the current position, although I have very small chance of winning, I have a very high chance of playing kingmaker. I inject a lot of chaos into the game precisely because I have no clear path to victory, which is going to lead me to make moves that are unusual if only because they are unexplored. That's going to continually jerk around your strategies. My ships mean that there are moves that Wil cannot take and moves that Marmalade cannot take -- but which limitations are more extreme are totally variable at my whim. And unless I'm missing something, I really don't have any reason to accept any diplomacy from either of you -- if I *actively* help one destroy the other, I definitely lose the game. If I tilt the balance such that one of you decides to attack the other and you both lose strength, that's the only shot I have at winning. 
 
So in a game between Alice, Bob and Chuck, I think the best strategy is for Alice to quickly identify the weakest player (Chuck) and then ally with the other opponent (Bob) to take Chuck out. The easiest way to do this without creating a formal alliance is for Alice to make an attack on Chuck that makes it dead easy for Bob to deliver the killing blow. 
 
In short, I have no reason to help you, and I am a chaotic force on the board that might swing for or against you. I disrupt your strategy versus the opponent that really matters. So it makes most sense for you to both be setting yourselves up to take me out, and if you watch each other's moves on the assumption that that is the goal, you can probably coordinate the strike without ever formally negotiating the alliance. 

96) wil: Move Y1 G1 Pong
	wil: I don't know...being a relative novice to the entire game this one has a twist.  I surely don't see anyone being able to wipe out anyone ina single move after a split...I also don't see a reason for any alliance....I see it as winner take all...what is the bennie of helping someone only to come in second?

	Marmalade: If it's worth anything for your analysis - your early attacks were somewhat wasteful, so I saw an opportunity to get a step up the ladder. Then, for a few reasons, but mostly my fault, this allowed Wil to take the advantage from me.
 
I don't have a short-term goal of removing you, so much as there was a tactical opening to do so.
	wil: Yes currently scary for me..I'm the worst player of the three, and much more used to seeing an uphill battle by 30 moves into the game.   The whole king maker concept I still don't understand....if you were to continue waiting and watching when one of us attacks you'd be in a position to be even up due to losses and risks during the attack.

107) Aristos: Build R2 Aristos
	Aristos: It cost me all of my green tech, but I just couldn't see any way that destroying *6* ships with one of mine was a bad trade.

	Marmalade: I do wonder how likely this is to simply stalemate. It's a problem in any free-for-all multiplayer game, of course, but I wonder if the simplicity of Homeworlds doesn't tend towards that outcome, given good play.

	wil: with a three way here, I don't see a stalemate...there will be a moment where one does pounce and the other take advantage the two on one will build both, the loser making some last ditch effort to be kingmaker as they die out...

Amazing.  Earlier you were saying you hadn't got so far in a multiplayer game...looks like to me this is going to go over a hundred moves.  And I look forward to them.
