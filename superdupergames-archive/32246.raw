Catastrophe Felix Green

19) dlwillson: B Y1 Dlwillson
	Felix: Dang it, nice one :)
	dlwillson: I think you responded wrong. I think you should've attack my big green, forcing me to do the cat, so you'd have the lead.
	dlwillson: And thank you, I was pretty proud of the assault. :-)
	dlwillson: Hmm... Maybe not. If I do the cat, I might get an extra ship out of it.

20) Felix: T Y2 G2 Felix
	Felix: Either way, I think you would have an edge, but I'd rather be in control of what happens ;)

	Felix: .... Oh.

31) dlwillson: Build G1 Dlwillson

32) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: This has been a weird game. No real developments and Felix is without a large for the second time with no other star systems.

33) dlwillson: B G2 Dlwillson
	Felix: I have nothing but hobbits.

34) Felix: Build G2 Felix

Build Y2 Dlwillson

42) Felix: Build G2 Saveme

43) dlwillson: Build G3 Dlwillson
	Felix: I don't want YOUR help! Sending distress signals across the
 cosmos...

44) Felix: Build G3 Felix
	dlwillson: LOL! But ... but, I'm right *here*! I can help you!

45) dlwillson: Trade Y3 R3 Saveme
	Felix: Like the last time you "helped" me with your happy yellow ships? No thanks ;)

46) Felix: Sacrifice G2 Hope
Build G2 Saveme
Build G3 Hope
	dlwillson: I think my last turn may have been a mistake. I think I shoulda swapped to red a turn or two ago... This game is hard.

47) dlwillson: Attack G2 Saveme

48) Felix: Trade G3 R3 Hope

49) dlwillson: Trade G2 R2 Saveme
	Felix: Definitely tricky! I thought for sure I was a goner a while back. I think you also failed to capitalize on an opportunity to move your large into my homeworld before I could get one. But yeah, trading for a red sooner would have expedited that attack...

50) Felix: Sacrifice G3 Felix
Build G2 Saveme
Build G3 Hope
Build G3 Felix
	dlwillson: I didn't move in, because you always had the ability to stop me with a catastrophe. It would have been expensive to you, so I suppose I should have, anyway.

51) dlwillson: Move G1 Dlwillson Saveme
Catastrophe Saveme G
	Felix: It was a tricky situation, and I'd say I got very lucky!

64) Felix: Trade Y1 G1 Felix

65) dlwillson: Trade R3 B3 Saveme
	Felix: This is an interesting stand off...

66) Felix: Move R3 Hope Felix
	dlwillson: I was debating between that and building an r1.
	dlwillson: I'm still not sure which is the better move. If this were a ladder match, I'd have set up the plastic and played out the various moves.
	Felix: Yeah, I usually play while I'm at work, so I don't have the chance to break out the plastic! I do a lot of mental gymnastics though. Sometimes I write it out on paper to try to visualize it!

67) dlwillson: B B1 Saveme
	dlwillson: You should do what SilentTitan, my brother-in-law, does; take your 'mids to work and teach everyone Homeworlds. :-)

68) Felix: Trade R3 Y3 Felix

69) dlwillson: M B3 Saveme Dlwillson
	Felix: I could! And interesting... I didn't know you and SilentTitan were related. He's an excellent player as well. Which one of you got the other one into Pyramids?
	dlwillson: I started it. Many years ago, I saw Brian Trotter playing WW5 and fell in love with the pyramids, though not with WW5.

70) Felix: Move R2 Felix Saveme

71) dlwillson: Sacrifice Y1 Saveme
Move B1 Saveme Dlwillson
	Felix: Yeah, I'm not such a fan of WW5 either. I was introduced via martian chess, which is a pretty decent game, but nothing like Homeworlds.

72) Felix: Attack G1 Saveme

	Felix: That's about what I figured. Worth a shot though!

90) Felix: Sacrifice Y2 Hope
Move R1 Hope Dlwillson
Move R2 Saveme Dlwillson
	dlwillson: I gotta admit; I'm surprised. I thought you had me.

91) dlwillson: A G1 Felix
	Felix: And I thought you had me quite a while back. It was a foolish attack, to be honest, and left me wide open. I could have played the safe game, but sometimes that's just no fun :P
	dlwillson: Another very fun game. Thanks Felix.
