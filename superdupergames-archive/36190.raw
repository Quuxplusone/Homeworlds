Catastrophe Cuc B

	Cuc2: I tried 
[m y3 Cuc2 Cuc
c Cuc b
c Cuc2 b]
and I got this message (not an error): "You may not cause your own elmination. You must ensure you control at least one ship in your home system at the end of your turn."
This means that SE (Simultaneous Elimination) is not allowed. But we've seen that Suicide is allowed, although you will lose. (Not totally consistent.) This reminder corresponds to the original 2002 rules!
