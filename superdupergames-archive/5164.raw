Homeworlds Online (SDG# 5164)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2006.11.23, Ended: 2007.1.2
Participants: Kenchi (S), Keith (N)
Winner: Keith

1) Keith: Homeworld Y1 B2 G3

2) Kenchi: Homeworld G3 Y1 B3

3) Keith: Build G1 Keith
	Keith: Hello Kenchi.  Thank you for taking me up on unrated game
	Keith: That should read "on my unrated game offer."

4) Kenchi: Build B1 Kenchi
	Kenchi: Thank you for the offer, I need the practice.

5) Keith: Trade G1 Y1 Keith
	Keith: Here is a good initial thing to watch out for, at least in a two player game.  I deliberately chose a y1 as part of my home system in the hopes that you would too.  What happens to your ability to develop yellow when I grab the last y1?  How would it differ if your home system was y2 g1?

6) Kenchi: Discover B1 Kenchi G2 Aldune

7) Keith: Build G1 Keith

8) Kenchi: Build B1 Kenchi

9) Keith: Build Y2 Keith
	Kenchi: I build y2s? I have no idea how having a y2 star would change anything.
	Kenchi: Oh, great, I can't build y.

10) Kenchi: Trade B1 R1 Kenchi
	Keith: Right.  You can't build Y without having a Y ship.  You can convert your b3 to a y3 but then you have lost a turn.  If you had a y2 star at the start there would have been 2 y1s in the pool and when I grabbed one then you would grab the other.
 
I am not going to strangle your game by hoarding the y's.  After I build a y2 I will put my y1 back in the pool for you to use.

11) Keith: Trade Y1 R1 Keith

12) Kenchi: Build B1 Kenchi
	Keith: One of the rules of thumb is that if your opponent pulls a gun (builds a red) you had better have one too.  I will throw that y1 back in the pool for now and pick up a r1.

13) Keith: Discover Y2 Keith G3 Behemoth
	Kenchi: *Groan*

14) Kenchi: Trade B1 Y1 Kenchi
	Keith: Groan?
	Kenchi: Now we have guns out and I'm still not sure what I'm doing.
	Keith: Well how focusing on getting into yellow?  Build a b1 or r1 in Aldune or a b1 in Kenchi and the turn after that convert it to a y1.  To get the y1 one turn faster undo you move and build a r1 or b1 in Kenchi this turn and convert it next turn.
	Kenchi: Ok, I'll try that.

15) Keith: Trade G1 B1 Keith

16) Kenchi: Build Y2 Kenchi

17) Keith: Build G1 Keith
	Keith: There you go.  You have access to all the colors.  I see in the 4 player game you have already applied what you have learned here and grabbed a green ship.

18) Kenchi: Move Y1 Kenchi Aldune
	Kenchi: Yes, right. Guess I am learning after all.

19) Keith: Move Y2 Behemoth Aldune
	Keith: Be careful about putting three items of the same color in a system.  If I put a fourth I can trigger a catastrophe.  You are safe for the moment.  The Y2 at Behemoth is two moves away from you homeworld.

20) Kenchi: Sacrifice Y1 Aldune
Move B1 Aldune Kenchi

21) Keith: Build R1 Keith
	Kenchi: Thanks, I'll watch out for that.
And thanks for the other game's advice.

22) Kenchi: Build R2 Kenchi
	Kenchi: Hmmm....

23) Keith: Discover R1 Keith Y3 Okikiro
	Keith: You should probably undo that move.  If I move my y2 from Aldune to Kenchi I can create a yellow catastrophe in Kenchi and you will lose all of your yellow pieces there.
 
One threat you are facing is that if I sacrifice my r1 in Keith then I can attack and take one of your ships in Aldune.  You can move the y1 or b1 out of Aldune or even sacrifice the y1 in Aldune and more out the b1 so I can't sacrifice my r1 and take your ship.  Of course sacrificing my ship to get a ship means I don't gain a ship but you would lose one.
	Kenchi: I forgot about sacrificing...

24) Kenchi: Move R2 Kenchi Aldune
	Keith: Sacrificing and gaining extra moves and flexibility is the key to strong play.

25) Keith: Sacrifice Y2 Aldune
Move G1 Keith Okikiro
Move B1 Keith Okikiro

26) Kenchi: Build Y1 Kenchi

27) Keith: Build R2 Okikiro

28) Kenchi: Build R2 Kenchi
	Keith: Here is where the advantage of sacrificing comes in.  If I sacrifice my r1 I can attack anywhere on the board as long as I have a ship as big or larger than an enemy ship in a sector.  I can take your r2 in Aldune.
	Keith: For example:

29) Keith: Build G1 Keith
	Keith: However, I will do something else instead.

30) Kenchi: Build R3 Kenchi

31) Keith: Trade R2 Y2 Okikiro

	Keith: No moves, no polite message to wait.  No more game.
