1) jonaskoelker: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3
ZackStack: Hi Jonas! I understand you're pretty new to Icehouse. If you'd like I'd be happy to point out any particularly dangerous moves you make. Have a good game and have fun!

2) ZackStack: Homeworld R1 B3 G3
jonaskoelker: Good luck, have fun.

jonaskoelker: At http://www.superdupergames.org/?page=archive_play&gid=2121&idx=25 I think TwoShort has a better move than "14. move g2 yonder bluonia; ...". What do you think? [I'll give my answer below]

jonaskoelker: I think I know some of the important strategic considerations: always have a large ship in your homeworld; try to have more large ships than your opponents; having your ships near your opponent's homeworld (and secondarily near your opponent's ships) is good since you can threaten invasion and either conquest or catastrophe more often (and generally make it harder for your opponent to build up a fleet); similarly, you want your opponent's ships away from your homeworld and your ships; ideally both, by having more and bigger yellow ships than your opponent. Don't get locked out of a color. *Really* don't get locked out of yellow. Pick the banker opening if you can. The gun rule (get red the turn after your opponent). Did I miss anything major?

jonaskoelker: At the position I pointed to, I think TwoShort should instead sacrifice his Y3 at home to move Y3 and Y1 to Andy's homeworld, and his G2 to the small yellow star. This threatens both a yellow catastrophe at Andy's homeworld, and a takeover of Andy's ships. This forces Andy to sacrifice a yellow ship, bring all his yellows and one other ship home, and trigger a yellow catastrophe himself. If he brings home his R1, TwoShort can then invade Andy's homeworld with the G2 at Y1, and Andy is defenseless. If instead Andy brings home his G2, TwoShort can build a G3 at Y1 and invade with that the next turn, against which Andy can build no adequate defense.

jonaskoelker: I think TwoShort was already ahead in the position where he moved his g2, but I'm not quite sure which strategic element put him ahead. I'm leaning somewhat to the strength of the banker opening, which gave him an easy investment in the Y3 which he later cashed in on. But it's not clear to me how the race for big greens will turn out if both players play optimally.

jonaskoelker: How am I doing for a newbie? ;-)

3) jonaskoelker: Build G1 Jonaskoelker
ZackStack: You've clearly done your research. I look forward to seeing you put it into practice! :-)

ZackStack: I think you might be right about that better move... but it would have left TwoShort without a large at his Homeworld and if Andy got out of his impending predicament somehow it would have left Two at a disadvantage. I've been learning patience is an important tactic in this game...

jonaskoelker: Oh, you don't need any small blues? I guess I'll have to keep them for myself then ;-)


9) jonaskoelker: Discover B1 Jonaskoelker G3 Biggreen
ZackStack: Not right now... :-p

10) ZackStack: Discover G1 Zackstack B2 Tooblue

11) jonaskoelker: Build B2 Jonaskoelker

Build B2 Bigyellow
Build B3 Biggreen
Build B3 Jonaskoelker

16) ZackStack: Discover Y1 Tooblue G3 Verygreen
jonaskoelker: You don't need any blue? :-p

ZackStack: You'll have to trade them in for something else eventually :-)

17) jonaskoelker: Trade B3 Y3 Biggreen

18) ZackStack: Build G1 Zackstack
jonaskoelker: How will you make use of a blue piece in the stash? Trade to it? Build it?

jonaskoelker: I think I have strong answers to that until you have a second large ship; and I think I can build the large ships faster than you can.

jonaskoelker: Oh well, I guess I'll see :)
ZackStack: You are correct on all counts. That is a pretty nice blue strategy you put together. I'll have to try that myself sometime! :-)

19) jonaskoelker: Build B3 Biggreen

20) ZackStack: Build G1 Tooblue

21) jonaskoelker: Trade B3 Y3 Biggreen

22) ZackStack: Trade G1 Y1 Tooblue

24) ZackStack: Build Y2 Tooblue

25) jonaskoelker: Discover B3 Biggreen Y2 Medium_yellow

26) ZackStack: Build G1 Tooblue

27) jonaskoelker: Trade B3 R3 Jonaskoelker

28) ZackStack: Discover Y2 Tooblue B3 Moreblue
jonaskoelker: Behold the power of my fully armed and operational battle station! I foresee millions of ZackStack'ian souls crying out in terror, then being suddenly silenced. ;-)

ZackStack: Eek! Just do me a favor and hum the Darth Vader Theme whenever you move that sucker :-)

29) jonaskoelker: Sacrifice Y3 Biggreen
Move Y3 Biggreen Medium_yellow
Move Y3 Medium_yellow Zackstack
Move B3 Medium_yellow Zackstack

30) ZackStack: Build Y2 Tooblue
jonaskoelker: I don't think humming will be necessary. My battle station has long-ranged weapons, capable of destroying a planet from afar, so it will stay behind and let the star destroyers do the invasion.

ZackStack: Wow. Well played sir!

31) jonaskoelker: Sacrifice R3 Jonaskoelker
Attack G3S Zackstack
Attack G1S Zackstack
Attack Y1S Zackstack
ZackStack: That thinking about your moves strategy of yours really worked out nicely... I'll have to try it sometime :-p
jonaskoelker: Thank you :)

jonaskoelker: I think you could have stayed alive longer if you traded to a medium red instead of discovering the b3.

jonaskoelker: I'm surprised you never invaded biggreen with a green ship, threatening disaster in a few moves. Answering that threat would definitely delay and obstruct me.

jonaskoelker: Also, "capturing" the big pieces as stars seems like a good counter-move; if you could have done that earlier (I think--maybe--you could). It's hard for me to capture back those stars and letting myself rebuild them as ships without giving you the opportunity to re-steal them, which would delay and obstruct my amassing of large ships further.

jonaskoelker: But yeah, monopolizing blue works wonders :)

jonaskoelker: Thanks for the game, it was fun. I hope it was fun for you as well.
ZackStack: It was fun! And educational too... I had the same thought about big stars about two turns too late and didn't see the big 3 sacrifice coming (you'd been so focused on building on your "half" the sudden shift to the offense caught me totally by suprise!) I'm looking forward to a rematch sometime!
