	zoltar: I see that you are bidding on the Ice Towers set on eBay -- I bought one on eBay last year. I bid on a Zendo set (which unlike Ice Towers has the Homeworlds colors) a couple of months ago but I was outbid -- it sold for an outrageous $60.
	MikeYarrum: Yep, I figured that I might as well give it a shot - not planning on winning it, though. I mostly wanted the Zendo set because I already have a full set of Xeno pieces.

	zoltar: very sneaky, but you forgot that your plan to blow up my blue star could backfire...

51) MikeYarrum: Trade B2 G2 Sakaki
	MikeYarrum: True, but it's not as if I had much of a choice. You kinda got me up against a wall, here.

	MikeYarrum: Inside joke, Kaorin and Sakaki are characters from a Japanese cartoon, and K has a crush on S, but usually finds herself thwarted in her romantic attempts. So having her get supernova'ed right next to Sakaki... meh, I guess you'd have to get the reference.
	zoltar: I see -- I'd never heard of the cartoon.

53) MikeYarrum: Build G1 Sakaki
	zoltar: Yep, there was not much you could do, but giving me the b1 sped things up.

	zoltar: Your last move in the multi-player game was great, as it forced me to sac to wipe out the Y3 before it could escape, destroying all Jesse's threats against you.  Of course, now you've turned me into  an 'Iran' having weakened Jesse enough and have left me with an extra 3-pip ship.  Now you have to build and try to get the two of us to fight while you get strong and ready to attack -- you can't wait too long, and if I attack Jesse you have to respond, not only to keep me from winning, but because I'll be weak and over-extended at the same time -- so build fast and get ready for a big 3-way showdown!
