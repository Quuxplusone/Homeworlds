sordros: Very clever. I didn't see that coming.

Keith: Alas, I don't think you saw this next thing coming either. Though I have dragged my feet before taking my turn on the off chance you would look over the board and catch it.
Keith: With a yellow 3-pointer I could sacrifice and reach any system on the board from any other system. So any system with three of the same color was subject to catastrophe.

Keith: Thank you very much for taking up my challenge. Three others before you did not.

Keith: I feel a bit bad about playing hardball though such is the nature of a ladder game. Had this been an unrated game I would have offered a warning and encouraged you to redo your move.
sordros: You are right, I didn't see that coming either.
sordros: Don't feel bad about winning a game if you are following all the rules! 
sordros: I am the one that should apologize for not providing a suitable challenge!
Keith: Thanks for the game, and good luck climbing up the charts.
Keith: It is the nature of the ladder system to create some mis-matches since newcomers to the ladder always start at the bottom. No need to be concerned about your level of challenge. Homeworlds has a lot of learning curve. FWIW I beat Zoltar once using your grab the blue strategy while he used my grab the yellow strategy. So your approach was viable.
