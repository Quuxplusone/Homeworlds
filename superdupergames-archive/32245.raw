	Draw5PlayAll: Good game. I never expected that you would actually fall for the trap... I thought you would trade for an R1 (which makes my intent, getting the G3, impossible for the moment).
 
I would have been terrified if I had that bluebird homeworld for so long. 
	Felix: Well done. I definitely overlooked that. Rookie mistake! One of the drawbacks of these longer turn-based games vs real-time games is the ease of overlooking threats when coming back for a new turn.
