	xoet: guess i was wrong about venturing forth as for me I "trade y1 b1 xoet"  but I'm not sure why I did that?
	Kermit: well kinda right and kinda wrong. Any ship can move , BUT there must be a yellow ship or star in the system they are moving from. (if it is a ship ip must be owned by the same person as the moving ship.
The same is true of all abilities you can attack with any ship as long as you have a red ship or there is a  star in the system. you can trrade any ship as long as there is a blue star or you hace a blue ship in the system.
 
	Kermit: the one exception, sorta, is green when you build a new ship (which you can do with a green star or if you have a green ship in the system) you can only build colors of which you already have ships. for example, on my next turn I can build a ship in the namor system but the only color i cam buils is green. i could also move that green ship to another system since the star in the namor system is yellow. if i do this thow the namor system will go away as all uninhabited systems do.
	Kermit: one other thing to watch for if you haven't played before. Sacrifice, It allows someone to make three moves ANYWHERE whether they have that color in the system or not. for instance sacrificing a 1 point blue in kermit would let me trade my green in namor for another color. this can be sneaky epecially if a three point ship were involved.
	Kermit: oh, I said three moves..as many moves ans the dots on the ship you sacrificed. I have often seen a 3 pointer sac'd to knock someone out of the game though...so watch for it.

	Kermit: Dream_Control, NEVER have all the ships on your home world the same color fo mor than a turn. You are always beter off doing most of your building off of your homeworld or at the very least keeping the colors mixed at home. I  was planning to sacrifice my 3 point yellow move a g1 from namor to zodiac then then to your home. then move the g2 from zodiac to your homeworld and Catastrophe (that was all in 1 turn by way of the sacrifice). you saved me the trouble.

59) xoet: Trade B1 Y1 Xoet
	Kermit: All is not lost yet xoet but it does not look good. Also Dream_Control this is an unrated game and that is the best place to learn. First time I played homeeworlds i lost in a very similar fashion. I never saw the sacrifice coming and BAM I was out of the game. my first thought was 'what the.....' then I thought 'So THAT'S what a sacrifice is for!'
