	wil: thoughts on tournament length, lol?  I actually think it works..
	goulo: It's a lot of games for everyone!
It might have been good to break into 2 pools and round robin in the pools, then the top half (won most games) from each pool go to a second round of round robin.
The number of games was still OK, but perhaps only barely. :)

7) goulo: Build G1 Goulo

	goulo: Yes, I learned it back in 2003, and use it every day with my wife (I'm from US, she's Polish, we met at an Esperanto event years ago) as our default language, along with English and Polish. :)
	wil: Interesting.... I'm pretty sure that's the first ive heard of anyone using it.  Only heard it talked about.

54) wil: M G2 Y3 Citroneto
	wil: Is eto little?
	goulo: Yeah, the suffix "et" = little (similar to "ette" on some English and French words).
 
A lot more people are learning Esperanto in recent years, thanks to the internet making it easier to learn (e.g. lernu.net and duolingo.com) and to write/chat with people far away.

	wil: Do you think it has a chance to grow to its original intent?  
	wil: Do you have kids learning it?
	goulo: I doubt it will ever become a language everyone knows - that's a very ambitious goal, which probably no language will ever achieve. But the number of Esperantists keeps growing, and in practice, there are way more Esperanto speakers than I could ever meet, more books than I could ever read, etc, and I have friends and acquaintances in many countries thanks to Esperanto. E.g. this week I was corresponding with an elderly Japanese guy about musical instruments and boardgames, and the studies showing that mental activities like these help keep our minds alert as we age.
 
I don't have kids, but if I did, they'd speak Esperanto, English, and Polish.

	wil: I think you are the firat person I know of that speaks it...its ambitious goal I think hinders it.  Books, eh?  Are there movies? 
	wil: Now if they got kids to know they could learn a secret langauge their parents and teachers did not know..

	goulo: There are a few films, but since esperantists are a diaspora instead of concentrated in one place like a typical national language, it's harder for that kind of large collaborative project (films and plays). So there's plenty of books, like for any language, but not so much films or plays.
	wil: Hey whatchu doin sneaking in?  How do you say I'm on tilt in Esperanto?

Attack B2 Wil
	goulo: Ha ha, I'm not even sure what "on tilt" means in English, I had to look it up. (I'm not into poker at all, heh.) :)

	wil: I pulled the trigger to early...good game
	wil: I dont think it would have been any better sending in the r3
	goulo: I'm not certain whether my move really works or not. I worried you'd move some second ship in, then I'd not be able to capture 2 ships in one move, and if I sacrifice my r1 to capture 1, then I must spend at least 2 more moves I think to win, and meanwhile you need only 2 turns at my homeworld to defeat me. It was a tricky situation, but I figured this was my only realistic chance. :)
	goulo: Oh, but you couldn't move one to your homeworld, heh. So my move was clever after all. Tricky situation indeed. :)
	goulo: hmm, or you could have sacrificed a g to build a b3 at your homeworld.
	wil: I shoot from the hip...althiugg I should look longer when it is the end...it is just not in my nature
	goulo: heh, yes - it is easy to get swept up by the "heat of battle" and all that. :)
