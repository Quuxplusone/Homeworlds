Winner: Jesse

1) Jesse: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3
Jesse: It's been a while since I've played you. This should be fun.

2) TwoShort: Homeworld B1 G3 B3 *
Jesse: Ooh, I just noticed your ZPip challenge. Obviously, I haven't been following either the Icehouse list or SDG forums much, lately. This is the first I've heard of Andy's video. I believe it's the first time I've ever been mentioned on YouTube, and it feels good. :D

Jesse: Is your challenge still on? If so, let me just declare myself ineligible up front. I've already got a set, you see.

3) Jesse: Build G1 Jesse
TwoShort: Good to be playing you again too. The ZPip challenge is still on... At some point I noted that the two people on SDG I'd give a better than 50-50 chance of beating me the next time we played were the same two people who already had ZPips, i.e. you and Andy.
Jesse: Heh heh. Well, we'll see how this game goes...

19) Jesse: Trade G1 R1 Jesse

20) TwoShort: Attack B2N Gruber
TwoShort: Speaking of playing too hastily...
Jesse: This has its drawbacks for me, as well. I think I would have been better off if I'd done something like building another green at the HW, or a blue at Gruber, instead of moving out my y2, a couple of turns back.
Jesse: But yeah, I looked at this sequence before I decided it was okay to build another blue instead of swapping for a red. I really couldn't afford losing the moves that would have cost me, especially after scrambling into blue like I did.

TwoShort: Sorry for the slow play... that "life" thing...
TwoShort: As far as sticking it out or not, it's your call... I certainly like my position, but I can't find any short route to victory.
Jesse: No, sometimes the most reliable victory is a long, slow process. Still, it's not over yet. It's just Very Long Odds(TM).

Jesse: The slow play is not a problem, except that I would hate to win this one on time.

TwoShort: Sorry about that; I thought I'd get a chance to get online and make some moves while on the road, then it didn't work out that way.
