3) Danner: Build G1 Danner
	Broccoli_Commander: Hi, thanks have a good game too
 
For cycles I never encountered the problem but I'd suggest the following:
 
If a given situation is encountered twice we are not allowed to create it a third time.
	Broccoli_Commander: For instance player 1 plays X -> A and thus initiates a cycle like:
 
X->A->B->C->D->A
 
Player 2 is still allowed to play A->B (it might be the very best option; P1 is responsible for this play because he chose to play X->A in the first place) So we could have
 
X->A->B->C->D->A->B->C->D
 
but at this stage P1 must deviate from D->A: he started it so he must end it.
 
X->A->B->C->D->A->B->C->D->Y
 
Whaddya think?
	Danner: Ok, it seems fine to me.
