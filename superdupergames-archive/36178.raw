20) pould_: Discover Y3 Theta B2 Mu
	Babamots: Looks like you may have forgotten about red sacrifices. Having a red ship anywhere is like having a red everywhere.
	pould_: could you please explain that for me?
	Babamots: There's a special move called a "sacrifice". You put one of your ships back in the bank, but ANY ship that you control can use its power. I didn't have a red ship in Iconia, but my green ship could attack your ship once I sacrificed my red ship elsewhere.
 
If you sacrifice a small ship, then one of your ships can use that power one time. A sacrificed medium provides two actions of that power, etc. Since I sacrificed a medium, I could have attacked twice if there had been two of your ships available for capture (that extra action was wasted, but I didn't mind).
 
Here the latest version of the rules. Sacrifices are explained on page 5.

	pould_: cool, thank you

21) Babamots: Discover G2 Iconia Y3 Aldea
	Babamots: It's usually considered wise to keep a large ship at your homeworld. I can't do it yet, but I'm planning to get a medium to your home as soon as possible to get your helpless smalls.

22) pould_: Build G2 Pould_
	Babamots: Another of my plans is to sacrifice my g3 to build all the remaining yellow pieces.

23) Babamots: Move G2 Aldea Pould_
Catastrophe Pould_ G
	Babamots: So, the move I should make here is to win by moving my g2 to your home and triggering the catastrophe (four pieces of the same color in the same system can be instantly destroyed by either player, see page 9).
 
For your education, I'll do something else, and you can look for a way to defend yourself.

	Babamots: Looks like you've disappeared on me. Let me know if you want to try again!
