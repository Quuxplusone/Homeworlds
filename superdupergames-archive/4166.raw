Participants: zoltar (S), TwoShort (N)
Winner: TwoShort

1) TwoShort: Homeworld B1 R2 G3

2) zoltar: Homeworld B3 Y3 G3 *

3) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort
	zoltar: I suppose this might be the only defence against the banker...
	TwoShort: Gack! The micro-verse! Well, I've contemplated trying it in the past, but couldn't really figure out how it would go.  I guess we'll see...

4) zoltar: Build G1 Zoltar

5) TwoShort: Trade G1 Y1 Twoshort
	zoltar: what else could I do?

6) zoltar: Trade G1 Y1 Zoltar
	TwoShort: Well, I don't really consider the banker as overwhelming as you do. Even a merely small universe would let you move right to the 3 points to attack my investments or make your own.  In any case, I've never played with adjacent homeworlds, so I'm eager to see how it goes.

7) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

8) zoltar: Build G1 Zoltar

9) TwoShort: Move G1 Twoshort Zoltar

10) zoltar: Trade G3 R3 Zoltar

	zoltar: Am I dead already on the third move? Geesh!

12) zoltar: Attack G1 Zoltar
	zoltar: Better to have a big one, I guess,,,

13) TwoShort: Trade G1 Y1 Zoltar

14) zoltar: Sacrifice Y1 Zoltar
Discover G1 Zoltar Y2 Yuck

15) TwoShort: Build Y1 Twoshort

16) zoltar: Attack Y1 Zoltar
	TwoShort: Hey, I thought if I submitted a move not having seen your undo, my move shouldn't go through?
	TwoShort: Guess I want to do that anyway...


17) TwoShort: Move Y1 Twoshort Zoltar

18) zoltar: Discover Y1 Zoltar G2 Grok
	zoltar: One would think that there would be a safeguard so that your move would be rejected if it was in response to a move which had been changed. Is there such a safeguard on this site? I've never been in the situation.

19) TwoShort: Sacrifice G3 Twoshort

	zoltar: very sneaky

25) TwoShort: Trade G1 B1 Twoshort
	TwoShort: Not sure if I can finish you off though; I think those seperate outposts will give you flexibility

26) zoltar: Discover Y1 Grok B3 Blah

27) TwoShort: Build B1 Twoshort
	zoltar: I hope so. Though in retrospect a double-middle-star system may have been interesting, as I could both contest the big stars for the 'investment', as well as take key small stars to control the change of size at crucial times.

28) zoltar: Sacrifice G2 Yuck
Build Y1 Blah

	zoltar: It's over -- can't stop you from trashing my blue star

34) zoltar: Trade R3 B3 Zoltar
Catastrophe Zoltar B
	TwoShort: Looks that way...

	TwoShort: As for abandoning one's homeworld, I had a conversation with John Cooper a while ago to the effect that that rule should really be eliminated.  You'd still lose if you do it, but you might be able to wrest a draw out of an otherwise losing position by simutaneously destroying your opponent.  Since all the rule really does is eliminate what is otherwise an interesting emergent posibility, perhaps it should be done away with...
	zoltar: Hmm. I can't even sac my r3 to capture these, can I?
Oh well. I'm now convinced that the banker is a forced win. 
	TwoShort: Well, I'm not.  When you traded your yellow to blue, you could have instead sac'd your y3 to move in 3 ys from blah, causing a catastrophe and leaving me with no 3 pointer, while you'd still have had the R3...  I was already planning to get a red so I could destroy half my homeworld in a desperate defense...
	zoltar: Hmm. I never saw any of that.
