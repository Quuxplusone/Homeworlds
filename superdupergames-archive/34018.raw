	Thorolf: im screwed
	Thorolf: i didnt know you needed another ship of the same color in a system to build a ship
	Trydnt: you can take that move back
	Trydnt: you should either grow a g1 at home so after you trade the g3 for a red one you can grow another. Or keep growing the yellows since you need them to kill me eventually anyway and you can potentially trade them for reds. Your homeworld is protected by the red star for now so you don't have to worry about me moving in and taking your ships... yet :)
	Thorolf: thanks

13) Trydnt: Build R2 Trydnt

16) Thorolf: Move Y3 Alpha Thorolf
	Trydnt: you don't wanna move your large ship out of your homeworld or else I can move in and take over quite easily
	Trydnt: it also usually doesn't make much sense to double up a color on a star as that limits your capacity for growth. you want diverse portfolios of ships on each star preferably having one of each color (usually excluding the star color so you don't risk me blowing the star up)
