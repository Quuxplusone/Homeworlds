1) Simon: Homeworld B3 R1 G3

2) kanzenryu: Homeworld G1 B2 Y3
	Simon: Hi, enjoy. Since you're new, ask away if you have any questions whatsoever. :-) If you like, we can play with a 1-turn handicap (I will pass twice, because I'm starting player) or an even game with you moving first (I will pass once).

3) Simon: Pass
	kanzenryu: Hi, thanks for playing! I have no objection to getting squashed quickly... this is only my second game and one thing I'd like to learn is how quickly it can turn to custard.

4) kanzenryu: Build Y1 Kanzenryu
	Simon: Hehe, that's the spirit. Then let's still make it a game where you go first.

5) Simon: Build G1 Simon
	kanzenryu: Then it's a yellow star destroyer coming at ya.

	kanzenryu: Ouch... Was trying to move but had no yellow at home

20) kanzenryu: Build Y2 Glorp
	Simon: The opponent's yellows are important to assess frequently, to plan where & what to build, yeah. I can ignore making red ships so far, because you can't move yours out.

21) Simon: Trade G2 R2 B2

22) kanzenryu: Sacrifice Y2 Glorp
Move R3 Kanzenryu Glorp
Move R3 Glorp B2

23) Simon: Sacrifice G2 B2

Catastrophe B2 R
	kanzenryu: I suspect this will either be very good or very bad...

24) kanzenryu: Build Y2 Glorp
	Simon: I have to sacrifice to defend, but the net result is a 3-ship for a 2-ship.

25) Simon: Build G2 B2
	kanzenryu: That was a learning experience! Defending by sacrifice and catastrophe did not occur to me. More possibilities than meets the eye in this game.

26) kanzenryu: Discover Y2 Glorp G2 Staging

27) Simon: Sacrifice G3 Simon
Build G3 Simon
Build Y2 Simon
Build Y3 B2

28) kanzenryu: Build Y3 Staging

29) Simon: Trade Y2 R2 B2
	kanzenryu: Nice trick with building multiple ships per turn. I can't see a way to stop you from doing that.
	kanzenryu: Nice trick with building multiple ships per turn. I can't see a way to stop you from doing that.
	Simon: Setting this up is a common midgame target, and opening with a g3 ship is strong for this reason.

30) kanzenryu: Build G3 Kanzenryu

31) Simon: Sacrifice Y2 Simon
Move G1 B2 Glorp
Move G1 Glorp Kanzenryu
Catastrophe Kanzenryu G

	kanzenryu: Haha, I thought I had carefully checked for that. Okay, I guess I can safely resign at this point. Thanks very much for the game, it was a lot of fun.
	Simon: Thanks. Yeah, there were some neat tactical ideas. This might have given the impression that every possible catastrophe is a good play. But whenever you make one, you pay 1 turn + maybe a sacrificed ship + the ships to bring the count to 4. This is expensive, and making a developing move can be better on occasion.
	kanzenryu: It does tell me I need to pay far more attention to the possibilities of sacrifices! My wife just ordered me some of the pyramids for my birthday, so that should be fun when they arrive.
