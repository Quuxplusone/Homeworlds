Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2010.9.29, Ended: 2010.10.3
Participants: dlwillson (S), Keith (N)
Winner: dlwillson

1) Keith: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3
	Keith: Lets see if I can hold off a little longer this time.

2) dlwillson: H B3 Y1 G3

3) Keith: Build G1 Keith
	dlwillson: This is my favorite starting position

	Keith: Not with the red planet.  That seems to be the preference of the top tier.  Why is this your favorite starting position.

4) dlwillson: B G1 Dlwillson
	dlwillson: I like the early mobility and red always being a ship. They like the early trade to yellow and room for more yellow and planetary defense system.

5) Keith: Trade G1 Y1 Keith

6) dlwillson: T G1 Y1 Dlwillson

7) Keith: Build Y2 Keith

8) dlwillson: B Y2 Dlwillson

10) dlwillson: D Y1 Dlwillson G2 Spubit

11) Keith: Build Y3 Forrest

12) dlwillson: B Y3 Spubit

13) Keith: Discover Y3 Forrest G2 Ariel

14) dlwillson: T Y2 R2 Dlwillson

15) Keith: Build Y2 Forrest
	dlwillson: Too much green, I think. Sticking with it?
	dlwillson: To be clearer: Splitting your yellows is a no-brainer, but I don't think moving to another green is a good idea. I think you want to move to a blue, so you can start to trade off some of your yellow to other things. The advantage to going green is that if I trade out one of my yellows to keep you from building another battleship, you can just build the yellow I trade, and you still have a nice place to build the battleship on a subsequent turn. I guess green's not so bad...
	Keith: Since last game trading yellow meant you got it I was aiming clearing them out.  Unless of course a yellow catastrophe were to happen at your home world.  Maybe too much green.  Once the greens thin down enough you have that sacrifice a G3 and get it back cycle.  Though at this point I still have a G3 so maybe it is an opportunity.
 
I am sticking with my move.

16) dlwillson: D Y3 Spubit B3 Thingum

17) Keith: Build Y3 Ariel

18) dlwillson: M Y3 Thingum Keith

Catastrophe Keith Yellow

20) dlwillson: B G1 Dlwillson
	dlwillson: Have you heard of the gun rule? When the other guy goes for his gun...
	Keith: I have heard of the gun rule.  But all I could see was that Y3.

21) Keith: Move Y3 Ariel Keith
	Keith: When the other guy goes for his gun... blow him up?

22) dlwillson: B Y1 Spubit
	dlwillson: Yes. If the other guy is in the house with a gun,  blow him up, taking out half the house if necessary... :-)

23) Keith: Trade Y3 R3 Keith

24) dlwillson: T G1 B1 Dlwillson

25) Keith: Build Y2 Ariel

26) dlwillson: M B1 Dlwillson Spubit

28) dlwillson: Trade Y1 B1 Spubit
	Keith: That was fast.  Probably not a good sign.

29) Keith: Sacrifice R3 Keith
Attack B1 Spubit
Attack B1 Spubit
Attack Y1 Spubit

30) dlwillson: B G1 Dlwillson
	dlwillson: What's my objective now? A moment ago, it was to be the only guy in your house with a gun. What is it now?
	dlwillson: You still have the advantage of multiple valuable targets. I have only one viable target right now.
	Keith: I am not sure what your objective is now.  Overload me on blue?

31) Keith: Build G1 Keith

32) dlwillson: D G1 Dlwillson Y2 Dingo

33) Keith: Build B2 Spubit

34) dlwillson: Move G1 Dingo Keith
	dlwillson: Yes, and that was a decent remedy for the threat. It would have been better to build another red first.
	dlwillson: You lost a turn doing it that turn, because now you have go trade back into red. You should be fine, though.

35) Keith: Trade G3 R3 Keith
	Keith: I did not feel like I had time to build a red first.

36) dlwillson: Build G1 Dlwillson
	dlwillson: Let's play another game of Cannon. I'll challenge you.

37) Keith: Sacrifice Y3 Ariel

Move B2 Spubit Dlwillson
Catastrophe Dlwillson Blue
	Keith: Cannon sounds good.  You have me on the fence with Homeworlds.  I can't think it like I used to, however, my interest is rekindled and I am debating whether to put that much effort into it.

38) dlwillson: Build G2 Keith
	dlwillson: Actually, I've got a standing challenge for Cannon. Just join the game. But it's rated, so you better play to win. :-)
	dlwillson: Or, if you feel like walking me through a lot of strategy, just challenge me with an unrated game.

39) Keith: Build Y1 Ariel
	Keith: I will set up an unrated game with you going first.

40) dlwillson: Trade G1 B1 Keith
	dlwillson: I've lost this one, but I'll see how long I can hold on. Maybe a few more turns. We'll see.
	Keith: grrr too much focus on trying to finish you off.  

41) Keith: Attack B1 Keith
	Keith: Wait a minute.  The next green is a g3.
	dlwillson: I ~really~ wish SDG had more strict time limits on players. Like, if you haven't signed in in a year, your account drops off.
And, if you haven't taken a turn in 90 days, you auto-resign.
And, if you don't act on a challenge in 7 days, and you're not "away", you lose the match.
OK, I'm not sure that last one actually works, but you know what I mean. Some sanity limits would be nice and would make for more interesting reports.
	Keith: I guess it is not an issue but continuing to ignore my home system is.
	Keith: In theory there is removal after a year.  Aaron does not keep up with those things like he used to.  The auto resign would be good.  There are a lot of dead Homeworlds games.
	Keith: I am going to redo the same move.  I may be losing a game I had tied up but I need to learn how if that is the case.

42) dlwillson: Sacrifice R2 Dlwillson
Attack B1 Keith
Attack G1 Keith

43) Keith: Attack B1 Keith
	dlwillson: <insert randomly selected evil snicker>
	Keith: Now I get it.

Move Y2 Spubit Dlwillson

46) dlwillson: Trade G2 B2 Keith
Catastrophe Keith B
	dlwillson: This is the tightest end I've ever seen, I think.

	Keith: Thank you for the lesson.  I could not see that end game extending from not attacking the g1 when it showed up at my homeworld.
	dlwillson: Really, you played very well. The critical moments were the times you didn't go for your gun in time.
	dlwillson: I think you're as good or better than me, if you want to start playing rated games.
	Keith: I think I have two bad tendencies: 1) start a defensive move one turn late, 2) start an offensive series one turn early.  I am more inclined to sacrifice. 
 
Having to blow up half my house was interesting.  
	Keith: I am not sure yet if I want to get back into serious play\rated games.  If I do I will be taking turns a lot slower.  I had sped things up since I saw that it was your preference in the comments of one of your games.
