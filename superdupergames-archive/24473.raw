	wil: now this is synister yes?? only can attack left? I've never done this yet...
	Leonard_Daniels: Is it?  If it is, I'd forgotten.  Sinister doesn't affect who you CAN attack, though, does it?  I thought it just affected your victory conditions.

40) wil: Trade Y3 G3 Wil

41) Leonard_Daniels: Build R2 Leonard_daniels

42) Phil_Coulson: Move R1 Phil_coulson G1
	wil: i dunno...never done it...I'm asking...so it is a free for all?
	Leonard_Daniels: Pretty sure it's a free-for-all.  It doesn't say Sinister at the top of the page, anyway.  In any case, I've looked up the rules for Sinister Homeworlds and you can attack anybody you like, it's just that you win if the player to your left is eliminated.

43) wil: Build G1 Wil

52) wil: Sacrifice R2 Wil
Attack R2S G1
Attack Y2S G1
	Phil_Coulson: And I would have expected you to move the y1 to planet g1 rather than back to your homeworld!

53) Leonard_Daniels: Sacrifice Y3 G2
Move R1 G2 G1
Move R1 Leonard_daniels G2
Move R1 G2 G1
	Phil_Coulson: Shit. That doesn't work because you moved your y1 from the right place to a bad place so you can't help out next turn.
	wil: Help out??  What is this 'help out' notion?  Am I playing a team or two individual players?
	Phil_Coulson: No, but if any of us get too powerful the the others help out. In this case, had Leonard moved his y1 into the 'g1' system, that would be asking me to sacrifice and build a y3 and blow up all the yellow commodity in the system. It would help Leonard the most, but it would help me too as it would save my little ships, so I would take that offer. You would similarly do the same to me if I were intruding. That's the fun of 3-player games.
 
However, Leonard made a move worse than passing, and didn't build big ships. I have to wonder what that is about. As it is, you have a 90% chance of winning, Wil, as you will have all the yellow ships soon. If Leonard doesn't aggressively attack you now, I should simply resign. 

54) Phil_Coulson: Sacrifice B2 G1
Trade R3 Y3 G3prime
Trade Y1 G1 Phil_coulson
	Phil_Coulson: I think my position is lost no matter what, so I'll make a desperation move.

55) wil: Attack R1E G1
	wil: golly day....g3 prime looks like come kill me...  it can't grow, can't trade, can't move..witout a sacrifice in the home world...and the home world can't grow,    It is quite the stiuation...
	Leonard_Daniels: Phil, were you not listening when I told you I was terrible at this game?  Lesson for the future: never make plans based on the assumption that I know what I'm doing...

56) Leonard_Daniels: Sacrifice G2 Leonard_daniels
Build R2 G1
Build R3 Leonard_daniels
Catastrophe G1 R
	Phil_Coulson: Yeah, I've no idea what I'm doing here either. But I know you want to move everything out of your home world but one big and one small ship of the the two colors different from your stars.
 
and wil is right, I can't move my red ships. 

57) Phil_Coulson: Discover R3 G3prime Y1 Y1
	Phil_Coulson: My blue ship was dead in the water too, so might as well sacrifice it to change colors, I guess.

58) wil: M G1 Wil B3

59) Leonard_Daniels: Build G2 Leonard_daniels

60) Phil_Coulson: Build G2 Phil_coulson

61) wil: Build R1 Wil

	Leonard_Daniels: Sorry guys, still not used to this system; was on holiday for a couple of days in the Yorkshire Dales without internet access.  Haven't been playing a game over holidays before so it slipped my mind that this would be problematic.
	wil: It happens.   Now it is me and you Phil....   Are you guys both from England?
	Phil_Coulson: Nah, not worth it. Should have ended when one player is out, shouldn't it?
	wil: ah phooey....I like playing them out...I've yet to see a three player game last....someone always drops out....but a two player game with that large a bank is awfully interesting.    I was so ready to go get his ships!
