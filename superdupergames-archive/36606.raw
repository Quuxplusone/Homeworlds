	wil: Covid in England...what is going on?
	Trydnt: the government is feigning incompetence but they're relying on pretty standard psychological models of human behavior to undermine people's ability to adhere to and belief in the lockdown. They're planning to reopen shops in a few weeks. They consistently make their messaging confusing so people are less able to comply and then they can blame people for not following their rambling advice that didn't make sense. Cases are down but still highest in europe I believe, or even higher than the rest combined. The way they're easing the lockdown now I kind of expect to see a second wave begin in the next few weeks and they'll have to put the restrictions back in place and so the dance will continue
	Trydnt: or they'll just cut and run and string out all their voters to die and focus on attracting a new voter block. Thing is there are few blocks that have the size/vote share that the elderly population does so they'd likely have to try and bring together a more diverse range of people. Not sure the conservative mindset is capable of that. That's just the kind of evil I'd expect from them though. Most of their voters have spent years saying that people who didn't contribute to the economy were a burden and as time has crept up and they've all retired they may find themselves on the other end of the stick they've been swinging for decades. I hope enough people wake up and realize before the machine eats us all
