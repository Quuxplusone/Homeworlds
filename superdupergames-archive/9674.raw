Winner: Keith

1) stoneaxe: Homeworld R1 B3 G3
	Keith: Hello stoneaxe.  Decided to bypass Wyons I see.
	stoneaxe: He already has another Ladder challenge going.  Plus, he and I are already playing a non-ladder game. Is it unorthodox to bypass someone in the Ladder?  If so I was not aware!  Well in any case, thanks for accepting.  Good luck!

2) Keith: Homeworld Y2 B3 G3
	Keith: Trying to move up more than one rung is fair game and happens often. It lets you pick the opponent you think you have the best chance against. 
 
Wyons happens to be my favorite opponent in Grim Reaper.

	Keith: I must say I admire your willingness to jump into the deep end by choosing highly rated opponents.

25) stoneaxe: Build G1 Rez
	stoneaxe: Thanks!  I wasn't really trying to choose the highest rated opponents, just searching for some games.  The ladder seems like a fun little mini-tournament.  Plus, I'm learning a ton by watching all you experts tear me to shreds.   :)  This is a really cool game.  Its a lot like Chess somehow...

26) Keith: Trade Y3 R3 Keith
	Keith: I am glad to learn it is not discouraging you.  We should try an unrated game.  Then we can ask questions and discuss the game since learning, rather than winning, will be the goal.
 
My favorite games at SDG are Cannon, Grim Reaper and HomeWorlds.

Catastrophe Stoneaxe Red
	stoneaxe: I think I figured out your generous plan, but I'm not sure how I will stop it once you get more ships.
	Keith: That is the reason I delayed sending in reds till I had a green 2-ship.  Otherwise you could move them out before I had enough.
	Keith: I have at this point watched some of your moves in all of your current games.  Your learning very quickly.  I expect you will be climbing the challenge ladder soon.
