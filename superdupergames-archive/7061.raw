TwoShort: You're doing OK so far... As general strategic advice, the early game is largely about stash management: jockeying for position so that you'll get to grab more 3 pointers when they become available in some particular color.

TwoShort: Well, I really just mean that I usually throw in a little more discussion, particularly when playing newer players. I still play to win because I'm not really capable of making anything but the best move I see. But with the ZPIP challenge I've got a few more games going at once than I'm used to :)

TwoShort: Yeah, I think you're pretty doomed. I'll be happy to play it out if you want to see how long you can fend me off.

timotab: heh. OK. I'd done that myself on other people, but didn't expect you to pass one of your attacks, so thought I was safe for another turn. I'm very hosed
