Participants: Weishaupt (S), ts52 (N)
Winner: ts52

1) ts52: Homeworld Y3 B2 G3
	Weishaupt: This is my first time playing, FYI!
	ts52: Ok, are you familiar with the rules? Feel free to ask me questions. And post a move, then undo it, so I'll get email that you moved, and see your question.

2) Weishaupt: Homeworld G1 B2 Y3
	Weishaupt: I'm getting a handle on the rules. Thanks! Would be fine with strategy tips as well.
	ts52: To start, it's generally considered a good idea to start with blue, yellow and green in your homeworld, and make sure your homeworld system aren't the same sizes as mine (otherwise our homeworlds end up being close, in what's called a small universe, and it's easy to quickly attack each other.)
	ts52: Lastly, have fun! :)

	ts52: Since this is your first game, I wont kill you outright. But you should _never_ build up so you have 4 pieces of the same color in the same system. I could declare a catastrophe on your homeworld now and end the game. You also shouldn't build up 3 pieces of the same color unless you are certain there's no way your opponent can move a piece of that color in to create a catastrophe.

14) Weishaupt: Trade G3 Y3 Weishaupt
	ts52: Note I just created 3 green ships in my homeworld, because I know you can't get a green ship there this turn. 
	Weishaupt: A-hah, I see my mistake. Feel free to kill me if I deserve it though!
