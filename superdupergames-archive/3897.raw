	Keith: Darn!  I was hoping it was the strength of my play that was giving you pause.  ;-)   Moving is a drag even when it is an opportunity.  You have my sympathy.  Thank you for the notice.  I had wondered.

	MrStickman: To make matters worse, I think I may have broken my personal PC earlier recently. There was swearing. OTOH, I *think* I have an antique that'll be functional enough for internet and possibly even a little coding project (I want to try my hand at coding for SDG.) But that can all wait a few weeks.
	Keith: Uh-oh.  How broke is broke?  What kind of coding project for SDG.  Do you have a game you are going to get put on the site?  You are doing a very good job of resource management.  I bit the bullet and knew you would get a two pointer but you have immediately put me back in the same situation.

21) MrStickman: Discover B2 Lorem G2 Ipsum

22) Keith: Build G2 Keith
	MrStickman: "Broken" in this case means "the motherboard started comitting child abuse." It managed to kill the hard drive before Child Services stepped in and put the other components in foster care.
"Antique" in this case means the old Pentium I can put Windows 95 (eww) on and use to write Perl (which runs everywhere).
"Coding Project" refers to the handful of games I'd really love to see implemented. Aaron (bless his heart for making this site) seems to have his hands full with maintenance, and I'm a programmer who's been kinda curious about Perl anyway, so I'll try my hand at it.
Thank you for the kind words. I've learned Homeworlds is really played in the stash.
	MrStickman: Drat. The chat window doesn't preserve newlines.
	MrStickman: This is a test please ignore it.
< gt > lt & amp ' apos " quot

23) MrStickman: Build B1 Ipsum
	Keith: I have never been able to get line breaks which is why I had my topics all mashed together.  I think that may have been fixed.
 
Time to test.

	Keith: "Broken" - I am on my third mother board..
 
"Coding Project" - I am not a programmer.  My second to last programming class used punch cards.  However, in the interest of extracting information from the Cannon game database I have, with Aaron's guidence, acquired Perl, the database, and the "lama book" Learning Perl.

24) Keith: Sacrifice G2 Keith
Build G2 Midworld
Build G3 Keith
	MrStickman: The newlines are fixed. Thank God (or just Aaron). One of my internet pet peeves are self-publishers that don't ever hit the Enter key.

	MrStickman: I'm not sure where you're going with this. I suppose that means you deserve whatever you're trying to get...
	Keith: I said the same thing about your blue intentions... and bobbled it.  Maybe the next move will make it more obvious.

77) MrStickman: Trade Y3 R3 Mrstickman
	MrStickman: Well, I think I caught it, but I'm not sure I'm fast enough to stop it all....
	Keith: Maybe.  If I move another y2 in and you convert it I build one and create a yellow catastrophe.  (Thus the sacrifice of a y1 to move a y2 so I had a yellow to build.)  If you move the Y3 out I move my R3 in and start converting.  However, if you let me move a fourth yellow in and catastrophe you can then move your Y3 back home before my R3 can get there.  Hmmmm....

	MrStickman: Very well done! I was totally not expecting that final shot.
	Keith: Whew!  Thank you for the great game.  What a struggle.  I did not feel safe from the time you got all those blues.  I would like to play you again sometime either rated or unrated.
	MrStickman: Yes, absolutely. But not for a while. Homeworlds makes my head hurt.
	Keith: I feel worn down myself.  Sometime later then.
