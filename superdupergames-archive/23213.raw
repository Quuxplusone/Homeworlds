	Broccoli_Commander: Really nobody played you? I'm new here but it seems pretty active?!

4) Broccoli_Commander: Build Y1 Broccoli_commander
	SilentTitan: It is ... but been slow lately. for some reason.  After 6 months I finally got challenged for the top spot on the ladder. 
	SilentTitan: I guess that's not entirely true .. I was challenged a few times before. It has been a while tho..
	Broccoli_Commander: Oh you have the top spot on the ladder? Congrats :-D I just subscribed to it... I hope I can climb the bottom quickly, I guess the lower players are also inactive and I will have to wait for forfeits or whatever

5) SilentTitan: Trade G1 Y1 Silenttitan
	SilentTitan: LOL... it took me three years to get here and I fell into it because my bro-in-law challenged TwoShort and he failed to respond so he dropped to 6th.  Be hard to tell if I'm any good based on that last game we played.. eh?
