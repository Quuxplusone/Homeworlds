MadWuher: Thanks for the game. Just a quick question, why trade away your y3 for an r3?
Mouce: Heh, I didn't see that at all! I just made a stupid move, not noticing your threat... I traded the y3 for an r3, as you had no safe space to construct another y3, and I could have safely (perhaps) gained the y3 back in the next turn. A good move if you had no threat, obviously not a nice move given the position. I felt that I was playing nicely up until that point, too. Oh well! Live and learn. Thanks!
