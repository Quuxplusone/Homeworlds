Participants: Felix (S), wil (N)
Winner: Felix

1) wil: H Y2 B1 G3 Wil

2) Felix: Homeworld B1 G3 B3 *

3) wil: B G1 Wil
	Felix: I've never been able to get this opening to work successfully, but here goes.
	wil: I have, love the attempts at a second start freeze out

4) Felix: Build B1 Felix

5) wil: B G1 Wil

6) Felix: Trade B3 Y3 Felix
	wil: The question is always...do I put.an end to it by trading for a b3?  I think I can still catch up

7) wil: D G1 Wil Y3 Y3
	Felix: That's the question! Let's experiment, shall we? I'd be interested to know if there's a reliable way to defeat the strategy.
	Draw5PlayAll: Inform me.

8) Felix: Build B2 Felix
	wil: The b3 trade like you just did with yellow would get me there....but I think my heading to g2s may even freeze you out of Gs  unless you give up on a b freeze

9) wil: B G1 Y3
	Felix: Hmm, true. I have the option of gunning for a complete blue freez-out, but that gives you the opportunity to make most of the green, and even then, I think you could get to one of the blues before I manage to get them all... I guess the main benefit of my start is that it gives me earlier access to 2-pip ships

10) Felix: Discover B2 Felix B2 Range

Catastrophe Wil Green
	wil: Ending in silliness
	wil: Thx for the slaughter
	Felix: Silliness is fun. Thanks for allowing me to finally win with that odd blue opening!
	wil: Letting you?!?!!   
	Draw5PlayAll: I am just now trying it against ts52. I wonder what happens if the opponent picks a G1 or Y1 and you do a similar trick? (G1 = homeworld B2 G1 G3; Y1 = G2 Y1 Y3.)
 
I think the green one would be more successful and yellow less, since they started with a yellow star anyway.
	Felix: @wil Trying to be gracious here ;)
 
@draw5 Both of those would be less effective. The green is less effective because most opponents open with a green ship, so they will have access to green anyway and it doesn't really provide an advantage. The yellow version would be far too slow because you don't have any blue in your system so trading would be a pain.
	wil: I've done the no blue...having to go out to a blue star to create... But this is always a nice balance.... The second player can take these risks some times.
	Draw5PlayAll: @Felix No, I was meaning what if they choose, e.g. G1B2 stars and Y3 ship. Or similarly Y1B2 stars and G3 ship.
