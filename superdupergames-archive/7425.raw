Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2007.4.12, Ended: 2007.4.17
Participants: dsheldon (S), gypsydog (N)
Winner: dsheldon

1) gypsydog: Homeworld G3 B2 Y3

2) dsheldon: Homeworld Y1 B2 G3

3) gypsydog: Build Y1 Gypsydog

4) dsheldon: Build G1 Dsheldon
dsheldon: Good so far. I'm holding back from spewing forth the various theories on how to play the midgame until we get there.

dsheldon: In the beginning you want to get a good spread of ships, both colorwise and locationwise.

dsheldon: You also want to try and finagle things such that you get more large ships than I do.

dsheldon: Make sure you understand Sacrifice actions and Catastrophies (these mostly come up later, I'll point them out when we get closer), re-read those parts of the rules since they're pretty much how the game is won and lost.

5) gypsydog: Build Y1 Gypsydog

6) dsheldon: Discover G1 Dsheldon Y3 Jerome
dsheldon: See, right now you've got what is normally considered a dangerous situation: having three pieces of the same color in a system.

dsheldon: Right now it's OK because there is no way I could get a fourth there (and destroy them all), but after the opening rush of the game it would be a Bad Idea (tm) to repeat that.

7) gypsydog: Trade Y1 G1 Gypsydog

8) dsheldon: Build G1 Dsheldon

9) gypsydog: Discover G1 Gypsydog Y1 Yzerman
gypsydog: so how exactly do I get larger ships?

10) dsheldon: Trade G1 B1 Dsheldon
dsheldon: When you build ships you get the smallest one available in the color you are making. The way to get large ships is run out of smaller pieces.

dsheldon: The game, in the end, is about manipulating the global stash. Board position is a close second, but it's all about the stash.

11) gypsydog: Build Y2 Gypsydog

12) dsheldon: Build G1 Dsheldon

13) gypsydog: Build G2 Yzerman

14) dsheldon: Discover G1 Dsheldon G3 Bank

17) gypsydog: Trade Y1 B1 Gypsydog

18) dsheldon: Trade B1 Y1 Dsheldon

19) gypsydog: Build G2 Datsyuk

20) dsheldon: Sacrifice G2 Dsheldon
Build G2 Bank
Build Y2 Dsheldon

21) gypsydog: Move B1 Gypsydog Yzerman
dsheldon: now, I've set up two dangerous situations for myself. see if you can do some damage (if you want to).

22) dsheldon: Sacrifice Y1 Dsheldon
Discover G1 Bank B1 Colony

23) gypsydog: Move B1 Yzerman Datsyuk

24) dsheldon: Sacrifice G2 Bank
Build G2 Dsheldon
Build G3 Colony
dsheldon: A note on topography: Because of the nature of the rules, the galaxy ends up being kind of triangular. All the ones can get to all the twos and threes, all the twos to the ones and threes, and so on - but a two can't get to a two. Homeworlds are a special case because they have two stars. Usually (and this is true for this game as well) each of our Homeworlds only connects to one size of star. Yours goes to ones, mine goes to threes. Twos then, are kinda out in no-man's land. Now, this can change if one of our home stars is lost to a catastrophe, but that looks to be a ways off.

dsheldon: You're building up all these guys at Datsyuk and they can't get anywhere. Now, it can be good to have them out there for sacrifice actions, but that's pretty much it. Comprende?

25) gypsydog: Trade G2 R2 Datsyuk
gypsydog: I was actually kinda counting on that. I don't know if this strategy will work or not, but we're about to find out.

26) dsheldon: Trade G2 R2 Dsheldon

27) gypsydog: Build R1 Datsyuk
gypsydog: Wait a sec! I thought you needed one of a color to build that color in a system! How'd you do that?

28) dsheldon: Sacrifice G3 Colony
Build G2 Dsheldon
Build G2 Jerome
Build G3 Colony
dsheldon: Where, in dsheldon? I built a g2 there last turn (which I could do because I had a g3 even though the actual action came from the sacrifice of that same g2 in a system which no longer exists) and then this turn traded it for an r2 (which I can do because there is a blue star).

dsheldon: Trading (with the blue action) lets you go to any color, even ones you don't have access to yet. Was that your point of confusion?
dsheldon: And now, a lesson in denying your enemy pieces:

29) gypsydog: Trade R1 Y1 Datsyuk

30) dsheldon: Discover G2 Jerome R1 Striker
gypsydog: Yeah, I thought you could only trade for colors of ships you had colors in a system. Ugh. That would have made planning much easier. Ah well.

31) gypsydog: Build R1 Datsyuk
dsheldon: Now, what I've done here is position myself with three Green ships all one hop away from your homeworld (2 at Colony and 1 at Striker). The plan is, once I have a large Yellow ship, to sacrifice it and move all three green ships to gypsydog and triggering a Green catastrophe (because 3 ships + 1 star = 4 = BOOM!). This will obliterate half of your stars and make your homeworld (theoretically) much more vulnerable. It will also change the shape of the board because gypsydog will now be adjacent to 1s AND 3s because there will only be a size 2 star left in it.

dsheldon: Also, you really should diversify your homeworld fleet (yeah, I know, you thought you couldn't) because one catastrophe of the right color can knock you out completely.

32) dsheldon: Sacrifice Y2 Dsheldon
Move R2 Dsheldon Jerome
Move R2 Jerome Datsyuk
Catastrophe Datsyuk R
dsheldon: Now it's time to learn about sacrifice and catastrophe first hand:

33) gypsydog: Trade Y2 R2 Gypsydog

34) dsheldon: Trade G2 R2 Dsheldon

35) gypsydog: Move R2 Gypsydog Striker

36) dsheldon: Attack R2N Striker
dsheldon: Do you realize that this was a poor decision?

37) gypsydog: Build G2 Yzerman
dsheldon: Because Striker is a red star, any ships there can make attacks.
gypsydog: ah crap. yeah, i lost this one. this can only end badly now.

38) dsheldon: Sacrifice G3 Colony
Build G2 Striker
Build G3 Colony
Build R1 Dsheldon
dsheldon: Yeah, well, that was true a while ago. But do you understand enough to play a /real/ game yet? We haven't even begun the really deep stash manipulation stuff yet.

dsheldon: I lied, there isn't really anything that deep about, but it's a ton of fun to say stuff like that.

gypsydog: yeah, i think i could.
