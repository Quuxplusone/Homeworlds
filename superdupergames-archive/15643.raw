	Jesse: Oops.  Sorry about that.  Oh well, I was probably going down anyway.  Well played.
	zoltar: Thanks -- it was close up until that last move -- having all three Y3's is a huge advantage, as I just need to get a couple more blues and then move my pieces into position for the Doomsday Machine.
	Jesse: Yeah, I don't know why I missed that.  I'd been looking at it earlier, but for some reason just at that moment I only saw yellows on two systems.  :/
