Build G3 Jesse
jeep: That was a silly mistake last move, eh? Still, I'm getting so far behind in my games against you... Guess, I'm just not seeing it yet.
Jesse: It was kind of a silly mistake. It would have been difficult to avoid me getting the y3 anyway, though, since I could sacrifice (or use my factory) for it when the time was right.
Jesse: It's also difficult for you to avoid me getting that last g3, since I've been working towards factorying that one up, too. Removing that g2 from the stash makes that possible now.

32) jeep: Build R2 Jeep
Jesse: Sometimes, if you want to stop something like that, you need to remove the large piece from the stash by discovering it as a new system marker. I thought you might park your r2 on it, for instance. That would keep me from using it as a ship. Unfortunately, it would also give you some positional problems.
Jesse: At this point, I have much better production capacity than you, on account of my factories. On the other hand, you are better positioned to produce red ships. You may be able to make it difficult for me to actually produce anything without it getting clobbered.

33) Jesse: Move Y2 Ni San
jeep: Yeah, I've felt under the gun from the get go. I have a hard time getting a strategy working for me early. I'm probably too hesitant to commit to one. Trying to be too reactive. I'll have to consider it next time.
Jesse: It's usually not so much about about committing to a strategy, as keeping your strategy flexible. If you plan for multiple contingencies, you can have a main plan that allows you to not only react to your opponent's plays, but do so to your own benefit. Sometimes it doesn't work out that way, but it will happen more often as you learn common contingencies to plan for, and things to avoid that make your fleet inflexible.

34) jeep: Build R2 Moon
Jesse: One danger to watch for right now is that your large defender is the same color as one of your system markers, putting you in danger of losing both at once. Unfortunately, changing it gives you problems, as well.

35) Jesse: Build R3 Ni
jeep: At least I think I learned something new this time...

36) jeep: Sacrifice Y2 Moon
Move R1 Moon Ni
Move R2 Moon Ni
Catastrophe Ni Red

37) Jesse: Build Y2 San
Jesse: Did you intend to blast me (catastrophe)? If not, your plan is either too subtle for me to see, or you missed something that will seem pretty obvious in a moment.
jeep: Yes, I intended to catastrophe and missed typing it in...

jeep: I'm not thinking it mattered, though. Sure seems like a lost cause.
