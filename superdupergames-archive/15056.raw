Homeworlds Online (SDG# 15056)
Started: 2010.1.6, Ended: 2010.2.2
Participants: Asur (S), ZackStack (N)
Winner: ZackStack

1) ZackStack: Homeworld G2 Y3 B3
	ZackStack: Hey Ze' Mario!  Welcome to SDG.  Let me know if you have any questions about how things work.

2) Asur: Homeworld G1 Y2 B3
	Asur: Hello! I'll review the manual in a minute and play. Thanks.
	Asur: How do I see if I'm evil or good?

3) ZackStack: Build B1 Zackstack
	ZackStack: Evil and good are not necessary in 2 player games.  We just have to take out the other player's homeworld!
	ZackStack: Also... its a good idea to have different sized stars in your homeworld than I have in mine (say, small green and medium yellow).  With the movement rules that would keep me "farther away"  Feel free to undo, or we can just try this the way it is!

4) Asur: Build B1 Asur
	Asur: Ok, Thanks!

5) ZackStack: Discover B1 Zackstack G1 Emerald
	ZackStack: I should have thought to mention it when I placed my Homeworld... 

6) Asur: Discover B1 Asur Y3 Saphire
	Asur: No problem ;)
	Asur: You should construct another small blue ship, right? :P
	ZackStack: Yup.  You pretty well need to start with blue and green at your homeworld... and your first move is always to make a small ship.  From there you slowly get more options... but the game doesn't really get going for a few turns.

7) ZackStack: Build B1 Emerald
	ZackStack: Also... if you had left your homeworld sizes as they were... my small blue ship at emerald would have been "right next" to your homeworld instead of needing to visit a large first.

8) Asur: Build B2 Asur

9) ZackStack: Build B2 Zackstack

10) Asur: Trade B2 R2 Asur

11) ZackStack: Trade B1 Y1 Emerald
	ZackStack: Turn based works pretty well for this game... but I prefer having my opponent across the table to make it easier to chat about tactics :-)
	Asur: I know. I'm not a big fan of online versions for games. I tend to get lost... :)

12) Asur: Move R2 Asur Saphire

13) ZackStack: Trade B2 R2 Zackstack

14) Asur: Move R2 Saphire Emerald

15) ZackStack: Sacrifice Y1 Emerald
Move B1 Emerald Saphire

16) Asur: Build B1 Asur
	ZackStack: Good move... pleasantly aggressive.  I probably should have traded for a yellow on my last turn so I could sacrifice for two moves...

17) ZackStack: Trade B1 G1 Saphire
	Asur: Oh, you can move two ships at once? I didn't know that :)

18) Asur: Trade B1 R1 Saphire
	ZackStack: If you sacrifice a ship you may perform its technology actions once for each pip on the icehouse piece.  On my turn I sacrificed my little yellow ship to make one move with my blue ship (mostly to keep you from getting either).  Its generally a more valuable move when you sacrifice larger ships :-)

19) ZackStack: Sacrifice R2 Zackstack
Attack R1 Saphire
Pass

20) Asur: Build R1 Emerald

21) ZackStack: Build G2 Saphire
	ZackStack: Here I thought we could coexist peacfully around that star :-p  

22) Asur: Build B1 Asur
	Asur: Eheh. Sorry I took so long. I was kind of stuck regarding what I should do... :P I just realized I can't bring my red ships back home, ahah
	ZackStack: No problem.  One of my friend's comments during his first couple games was: "I can never do what I want to do!"  There is definitely a large amount of planning ahead necessary in this one!

23) ZackStack: Build B1 Zackstack

24) Asur: Discover B1 Asur G3 Diamond

25) ZackStack: Sacrifice B1 Zackstack
Trade G1 B1 Saphire

26) Asur: Move B1 Asur Diamond

27) ZackStack: Build B2 Zackstack
	ZackStack: There.  Now I'm ready to cause some trouble :-)

28) Asur: Trade B1 Y1 Diamond
	Asur: Eheh 

	ZackStack: That's a really bad move.  I can simply move my b1 ship from Saphire to Asur to cause a blue catastrophe.  You would loose all your ships at your homeworld and loose the game.  Feel free to undo!
	Asur: Just checking if you were paying attention.
-blush- :P

29) ZackStack: Discover B2 Zackstack Y1 Topaz

30) Asur: Move Y1 Diamond Emerald
	Asur: Sigh... I completely messed up the colors.

31) ZackStack: Build G1 Saphire
	ZackStack: Bummer.  Its no fun when your ships won't do what you think they should! :-)

32) Asur: Build Y1 Emerald

33) ZackStack: Discover B2 Topaz G3 Garnet

34) Asur: Discover Y1 Emerald R2 Stall

35) ZackStack: Build B1 Garnet
	ZackStack: Saphire is actually defended from that right now.  My G2 ship can use the attack action on your R2 ship since I have red technology in the system (my R1). Please undo or I will simply flip your ship to the dark... I mean... my side :-)

36) Asur: Build B2 Asur

37) ZackStack: Trade B2 Y2 Garnet

38) Asur: Move Y1 Emerald Diamond

39) ZackStack: Build B2 Garnet

40) Asur: Move B2 Asur Diamond

41) ZackStack: Build B2 Saphire

42) Asur: Build B3 Diamond
	ZackStack: Be careful... or its going to be business time! :-p

43) ZackStack: Trade B1 Y1 Saphire
	Asur: Garnet: Sacrificing your Y2 to move both blues to my homeworld, right, causing overpopulation?

44) Asur: Move B3 Diamond Emerald
	ZackStack: Yes.  Leaving two blue at your home would have won me the game.  I'll have to try something else now :-)

45) ZackStack: Sacrifice Y2 Garnet
Move B1 Garnet Asur
Move B2 Garnet Asur
	Asur: You wish. :P

	ZackStack: Let's see how this goes ;-)

50) Asur: Move Y1 Diamond Emerald
	Asur: Hummm
	ZackStack: I should have taken a longer look at the ships availible in the stacks before I did that... lets see how this works!

51) ZackStack: Build B1 Zackstack

52) Asur: Trade B3 R3 Emerald
	Asur: Talk about prolonging your eventual death. :)
	Asur: *my 
	ZackStack: Yeah... I should have picked yellow or green to blow up one of your home stars this turn.  I was greedy and hoped for another bad mistake :-D

Catastrophe Emerald Red

54) Asur: Build Y2 Emerald

55) ZackStack: Move Y1 Saphire Asur

56) Asur: Sacrifice Y1 Stall

57) ZackStack: Build Y1 Asur
	Asur: Nooooo
	Asur: Enemies forever, Santa! :)
	ZackStack: Well... at least until the end of this game :-)

	ZackStack: Bad time to pick being on your own I fear :-)
 
I'll be happy to play either game (or both) send me a challenge and I'll accept!
 
Thanks for trying out Homeworlds as well.  I prefer 2 player person... but have played the vast majority of games on here.
