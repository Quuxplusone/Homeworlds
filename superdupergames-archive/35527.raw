Homeworlds Online (SDG# 35527)
Started: 2019.11.19, Ended: 2020.1.17
Participants: Felix (S), Laurie_Menke (N)
Winner: Felix

1) Laurie_Menke: Homeworld Y2 B1 G3
	Laurie_Menke: Hi Felix! Sorry it took me so long to accept your challenge. Just as I accepted two tournament challenges, I also got a ladder challenge and a regular challenge from a new player. I couldn't turn either of those down, but couldn't handle more than 4 games of Homeworlds at a time, so I waited. Now that the dust has settled a bit, I'm ready to take you and Babamots on as well as NYCAvri's game in progress (and the new player game is still going!). Anyway, long story to say LET'S DO THIS!  Have fun!  :)
 
P.S. Just for the record, this game is for the Great Homeworlds Tournament of 2019, and I will fill out the required paperwork.  :)

2) Felix: Homeworld B1 G3 B3 *
	Felix: Haha, no problem! I understand that. I accept the terms of the tournament, and will begin drawing up the terms of surrender shortly ;)
 
Have fun!
