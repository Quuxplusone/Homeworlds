Participants: Draw5PlayAll (S), Felix (N)
Winner: Felix

1) Felix: H Y1 B3 G3

2) Draw5PlayAll: Homeworld G3 Y1 Y3 *
	Felix: Hello again. Have fun!
	Draw5PlayAll: Are we playing 2 games at once or am I remembering things wrong?

3) Felix: B G1 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: If I do not then I have to play an unfamiliar setup against a stronger player with a tempo less. I think we should make this interesting.
	Felix: I'm up for interesting and fun, and casual. I think you're quickly getting very skilled at this though and wouldn't necessarily consider myself a stronger player. As far as I know we just have this one game going right now

4) Draw5PlayAll: Build Y1 Draw5playall

5) Felix: T G3 Y3 Felix

6) Draw5PlayAll: Discover Y1 Draw5playall B2 B2

7) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: *access denied*

8) Draw5PlayAll: Build Y2 Draw5playall

9) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: The annoying thing is that I have to get blue quickly.

10) Draw5PlayAll: Move Y2 Draw5playall B2

11) Felix: Trade G1 B1 Felix

12) Draw5PlayAll: Build Y2 Draw5playall
	Felix: Yeah.... starting without blue is a really stiff handicap. That's why trying to do the insta-freeze start like you did is really only effective when done with blue.

13) Felix: Discover Y3 Felix G2 Roam
	Draw5PlayAll: Or green... if someone picks a G1 star you can do G1 B2 G3 and be in the blue economy via your star.
	Felix: That's true, but most people start with a large green ship, so there's not really any point in trying to freeze out green

14) Draw5PlayAll: Move Y2 Draw5playall Roam
	Felix: Wait... that's a bad idea.

15) Felix: Move Y3 Roam Draw5playall

	Felix: It was an interesting experiment though. And hey, now we know!
	Draw5PlayAll: Aww, it did not let me blow up your yellow star. Rematch?
	Felix: Sure! I'm always up for a rematch. Interesting game!
