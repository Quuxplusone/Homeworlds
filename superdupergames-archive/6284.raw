	TwoShort: Seriously though, TwoShort doesn't actually mean anything.  Many years ago I signed up for an account somewhere that would only allow a 6 charachter username, and none of my ususal handles fit.  In frustration, I came up with "2Short", as in 6 letters was too short, and eventually I decided I liked the sound of it.  Then when I ran into places (like here) that wouldn't let you start with a digit, I decied to spell out the 2 just to stay cryptic.  At at this point TwoShort has been my informal online persona for years, so I'm kind of attached to it, even thought the origin is sort of silly.
	jan: Thats great! I love that story. i had a similar experience trying to get my first email account. i tried many different versions of my name Jan Burger but to my suprise they were all taken. the closest i could get was jan burger 116 or something. my sweety sugested janthehero and it wasn't taken so i said i guess that's it.

	TwoShort: Yeah, usually my problem is being too agressive, but the small universe really rewards that.  Thanks for the game!
