	wil: nice game.
	wil: We have abandoned our homeworld with per our scorched earth scenario...taken our ark moment to establish a new base...and rule the galaxy in the next game.
	wil: never played one of these...it was interesting
	Draw5PlayAll: I hate seeing that a game ended not from my own actions... it seems like it will end up a loss.
	wil: Lol, your own actions ended the game...my resignation is the same as a win... As is an.ark.moment
