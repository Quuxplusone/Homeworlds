Winner: Babamots

1) thecolorbrown: Homeworld B1 G2 Y3
	Babamots: Good luck! I'll have to move slower in this. I've been neglecting work.

2) Babamots: Homeworld B3 R2 G3
	thecolorbrown: no worries. Same, I was in a zoom meeting the whole time. Unsurprisingly neither the game nor the meeting went well

3) thecolorbrown: Build Y1 Thecolorbrown

4) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots

5) thecolorbrown: Build Y1 Thecolorbrown

6) Babamots: Trade G1 Y1 Babamots

9) thecolorbrown: Discover Y1 Thecolorbrown G3 Endor

10) Babamots: Trade Y1 B1 Babamots
	Babamots: I've always used Star Trek worlds for my system names. Looks like you're thinking of using Star Wars worlds?

11) thecolorbrown: Build B2 Thecolorbrown
	thecolorbrown: I'm not sure. Star Trek is way better, I kind of hate Star Wars

12) Babamots: Build B2 Babamots

13) thecolorbrown: Sacrifice Y3 Thecolorbrown
Move B1 Thecolorbrown Endor
Discover B1 Endor R1 Hellitself
Move B1 Hellitself Babamots
Catastrophe Babamots Blue
	Babamots: Lots of people just call their systems boring things like "G3." System names that look the same as ship specifiers confuse me. Someone on here uses Muppets, like BigBird for a y3 system (I can never remember who does this, but D5PA will probably pop into the comments here to remind me :-D).

14) Babamots: Build Y1 Babamots
	thecolorbrown: probably stupid but i couldn't resist. never typed all that stuff out yet
	Babamots: I don't think you'll like this, but we'll see.

15) thecolorbrown: Build Y2 Endor
	Babamots: I do have to be super careful now. Without blue, yellow is my only ticket out of here. A green ship in a red system is a "Gilligan:" he'll never get away.

16) Babamots: Move Y1 Babamots Endor
	thecolorbrown: i'm definitely in a super precarious situation and will not be able to afford any mistakes...and so i hope that wasn't a mistake

17) thecolorbrown: Move Y2 Endor Thecolorbrown

18) Babamots: Build Y2 Babamots
	Draw5PlayAll: I have been summoned...
 
You are looking for ts52.
	thecolorbrown: I'm afraid I don't know what you mean

19) thecolorbrown: Build Y2 Thecolorbrown
	Babamots: I said that D5PA (short for Draw5PlayAll) would probably leave us a comment about who it is that uses Muppet names. He just did.

20) Babamots: Move Y1 Endor Thecolorbrown

21) thecolorbrown: Trade Y2 R2 Thecolorbrown

22) Babamots: Discover Y1 Thecolorbrown B3 Pakled
	thecolorbrown: That's a cool move.

23) thecolorbrown: Build R1 Thecolorbrown

24) Babamots: Discover Y1 Babamots Y3 Aldea
	Babamots: This is tricky. I'd better sleep on this one. I'll be back tomorrow.
	thecolorbrown: Good night, Wesley, good work. Rest well, I'll most likely kill you in the morning

25) thecolorbrown: Move R1 Thecolorbrown Endor
	Babamots: Moving my y1 to your home was actually a big mistake. It cost me two turns when I don't have any time to spare.

26) Babamots: Sacrifice G3 Babamots
Build Y2 Aldea
Build Y3 Babamots
Build Y3 Pakled
	thecolorbrown: definitely a tricky situation

30) Babamots: Sacrifice Y2 Babamots

33) thecolorbrown: Move Y3 Endor Thecolorbrown

34) Babamots: Attack B2 Thecolorbrown
	thecolorbrown: Crap. I think you got me by one turn.

35) thecolorbrown: Trade Y3 R3 Thecolorbrown
	Babamots: I'm not too sure yet. This is weird.

36) Babamots: Trade B2 R2 Thecolorbrown

37) thecolorbrown: Build R1 Thecolorbrown
Catastrophe Thecolorbrown Red

	Babamots: I think I've used "Undo" more in this game than I ever have before.
 
If I were to build an r1, you could have made it a tie by attacking the b2 repeatedly.
	thecolorbrown: yeah I think i'm going to just concede after all. Any color i change the r3 to, you just change to that color and start building to blow things up. Happens really fast if I choose b3 or g3 but then I can't build more without giving them to you. good game after all!
	Babamots: That was an exciting one. After you sacrificed your only large ship, I thought I would be able to get my large to your home and capture everything. But then there were too many other things to prevent or prepare for.
	thecolorbrown: Yeah, and I panicked for a few turns. I think if I had gotten right to the business of building up those r1s and throwing them at your homeworld, I might have been able to work it out. Especially with that red-herring y1 you send into my homeworld. Then again, even if you considered that wasted energy, I still had to take time to respond to it. Maybe it didn't cost you that much time after all. I'm gonna have to go back and study this one.
