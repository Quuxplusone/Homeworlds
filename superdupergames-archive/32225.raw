37) dlwillson: Move R3 Sea Sky
	dlwillson: I'm so used to playing against bankers...

38) Felix: M B1 Felix Tattooine
	Felix: Yeah... I do play it sometimes, but I've never been as effective as I could be at using that strategy. Plus it's less satisfying somehow to win with that setup since it's generally considered stronger.
	Draw5PlayAll: But I just send a spare R2 to your investment and scare it off! Why is it stronger than a 1-3? If I get small greens on 2-point stars, I can still move to large stars.

39) dlwillson: Trade Y2 B2 Sea

40) Felix: Move B1 Felix Endor
	Felix: @draw5 - it still gives the player a much greater control over the supply. Large pieces can be absorbed and kept from the opponent in a pinch. And small pieces tend to run out faster, limiting the ability of someone with a fortress to move out.

41) dlwillson: M B2 Sea Sky
	dlwillson: @draw5: You are uniquely positioned to understand the importance of being a banker: http://superdupergames.org/main.html?page=play_homeworlds&num=32303

	Felix: OUCH. Really nice. I didn't see that coming.
	dlwillson: I've been wanting to do that since you got the second big green, but I couldn't set it up right until then. Unfortunately, it was about as expensive for me as it was for you.

Sorry about that old chap. I'm afraid I tend to kick and squirm. But I think you have me in the wrong footing now.
	dlwillson: LOL! I read that in the voice of Mr. B, The Gentleman Rhymer.
	dlwillson: I suddenly became terribly afraid you were going to blow up Sky, and completely end my little game, so I started diversifying.

	Felix: Haha, I didn't know you could trade for the same color. That's funny.
	dlwillson: Thanks!
	dlwillson: I meant "Thanks!" to "nicely done"
	dlwillson: Excellent game! Now, to focus on work for a few hours!
	Felix: Yes, great game and well played. I thought I was a goner several times before you closed the deal. I have some work to do too, and then I should gather all of my wits for the epic ladder battle.
	dlwillson: o/\o
