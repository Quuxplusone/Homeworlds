	endo: Whoops... just realized you have a red sacrifice, so I can't do that just yet :)
 
Getting the reds was dangerous. No reds were gone from the bank yet, and since medium blues are available, there was no way for you to control red (which would be very powerful if you could do it, hovewer). Getting into the red economy a bit later in the game creates threats your opponent needs to respond to (typically by getting red himself), but here you weren't in range (no yellow sacrifices, no yellow on your G1 star), so I could continue creating more blue build capacity for myself. Being able to build a lot of ships in a color in which the large ships are going to be exposed in the bank is the main goal of the early game (and usually very useful later as well). I strongly believe Homeworlds is a first-player win with optimal play (draws are rare, and I don't think getting to see your opponent's homeworld choice before making yours can win you the game). That means you have to be extremely careful to make the moves that make the greatest difference, since throwing away even one move effectively makes your opponent the one going first.
	endo: Oh, and another thing: By trading away the last ship of a color on a star you lose your build capacity in that color on that star. Even if you get a new color, that's inferior to trading away one of two (or three) ships of the same color on the same star. So, in general, you should first build, then trade (two moves used, two colors available on that star), rather than trading before building (two moves used, but only one color available). In this case, even though red is a better color to build at your homeworld (because of the blue star), I didn't have immediate catastrophe threats, so you shouldn't have given up the blue ship there just yet. Continuing this logic, discovering new stars when you are supposed to get in some new color is something to avoid. It uses up TWO moves - one for building the ship you discover with, and another for the discovery itself. After the discovery, you are forced to either make a trade that does not increase the number of your color accesses (counting the same color on different stars separately), or risk giving your opponent a monopoly. That didn't happen in this game (blue was the color being contested, so splitting your blues was definitely correct), but see the initial moves in my ongoing ladder game against Simon for an example: http://superdupergames.org/?page=archive_play&gid=29118
	Felix: Wow, thanks so much for the detailed tips! I appreciate the help a lot. :) I'll keep that in mind in future and maybe have a better shot!
