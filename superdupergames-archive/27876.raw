	wil: lol... I've been wasting my time..  and we've just encountered an error in the system..I could sack my y3 and send in y2 and two Gs and catastrophe all your Ys and Gs but the system won't allow any moves after the first catastrophe.... which made me realize why am i focused on your ships when I only need to attack the star...
	mcowper: I saw that double catastrophe and was wondering if the system could handle it. I was kind of figuring that you would go after the star. I'm resigning. Thank you for a good game. We'll play again soon.
	wil: quite the back and forth...challenge anytime...thanx
