3) dethdukk: Build G1 Dethdukk
dethdukk: taking a handicap? or just trying a strategy?

4) TwoShort: Build B1 Twoshort
TwoShort: Demonstrating the error in taking a b1 star as first player. :)

5) dethdukk: Build G1 Dethdukk
dethdukk: hm... never seen this one. should be interesting.

6) TwoShort: Trade B3 Y3 Twoshort

7) dethdukk: Discover G1 Dethdukk Y2 Launch
TwoShort: It's a wacky tactic (which I'm inherently a sucker for), and at least reverses the 1st player advantage. Looking at it now, it appears it is actually slightly less devastating since you started with Goldilocks and not Banker.

8) TwoShort: Build B2 Twoshort

22) TwoShort: Build B2 Grogar

23) dethdukk: Build G2 Move

24) TwoShort: Trade B2 Y2 Grogar
dethdukk: hm. it is interesting. I wouldnt have thought you could lock me down quite that easily. I probably should have explored medium greens and gotten some G3 ships before you locked them into worlds

25) dethdukk: Move G2 Move Pull
TwoShort: Meanwhile, I've been thinking this strategy is really tough to pull off starting from banker; I usually do it from Goldilocks so I'm able to move out to a b2 and lock them down a turn faster.

26) TwoShort: Build B2 Grogar

27) dethdukk: Build R1 Pull

35) dethdukk: Build R1 Pull

36) TwoShort: Discover G3 Grogar B2 Boomer
dethdukk: so MadWuher tried using this same strategy with the game I am in with him... unless I am mistaken (which I might be) I believe I have escaped it by trading my G3 starting ship for a B3.

37) dethdukk: Discover Y1 Pull Y1 Mobile
TwoShort: Nice work. It's clear that this opening isn't effective vs. as many first player homeworlds as I previously thought.

38) TwoShort: Sacrifice G3 Move
Build B2 Grogar
Build B3 Grogar
Build G3 Move

dethdukk: ya got me, not much I can do about it now. good game, I learned a lot that I should be able to use.
