4) zoltar: Build G1 Zoltar
	zoltar: Angel, have you played before? You really don't want to have stars the same size, as it puts your homeworld directly next to mine in distance. Also, you need to have green to grow ships. You're only first move here would be to exchange your R3 for a G3. Perhaps you want to undo your move and try "H R3 B2 G3" which would be a much better stating move. 
	zoltar: Do you want to alter your starting position while you still can, or should I just make a move?

21) wil: Build R2 Wil
	wil: first time in a three way playin it safe...
	zoltar: Weak moves aren't necessarily saver. You could have bought an R2 then flipped it to blue next move, and that would have made your homeworld much 'safer'. 
	wil: nice tip!  thx, I didn't see that.  Yes growng bigger pieces when you can, gotta keep that in mind.  (currently refraining from backing up so to cement the lesson)

22) zoltar: Build R2 Zoltar
	wil: This zero/time is up feature when you've only been gone a couple of hours needs fixing....when someone is way behind and finally takes action, the next player is suddenly behind...
 
So what do we do now, play a two player game with lots of pieces?   You've got an easy shot waltzing in and aquiring a  g3 for  free...

23) wil: Discover R2 Wil G2 Wtf
	zoltar: Yeah, if it didn't have the 'hard time' option, then now we could choose to make Argel resign or terminate the game. up to you if you want to continue, but yeah, it gives me an advantage.

24) zoltar: Discover R1 Zoltar G3 Greenslime
	wil: I like losing...being new it is the best way for me to learn.  If you don't mind, I'd like to play it out and see how you take advantage of the advantage and how I can counter...

36) zoltar: Build B1 Greenslime
	zoltar: Yeah, any time an opponent constructs either a Y2 or Y3, you've always got to ask yourself, "is there any weakness a double (or triple if the case) move can exploit, either by focusing on hyperloading one color in one location, or making two simultaneous threads in two different locations.
