	Broccoli_Commander: I saw your game against inundator, I was quite disappointed by the ending (not by the result itself, ofcourse :-D)
After turn 19:

The situation was very interesting and I almost feel like he should have beaten you or at least have a sizeable chance of doing so(although it is counterintuitive at first sight). What would you have done if he had played
 
s y3 ace
m g2 ace inundator
m y1 ace inundator
m g1 gene inundator
?
 
And frankly tell me if you don't care :-D (after all he did _not_ play this...) I won't take any offense.

	dlwillson: D'oh! Dammit. Timed out, plum blossom... Sorry about that, BC. I'm going to take a break from SDG. I'm obviously too busy.
	Broccoli_Commander: Hey no problem, I got close several times as well.... Now I get why 1/1/X is not a good idea. 
Have fun in whatever keeps you busy, and hope to see you soon again on SDG dear Sir!
