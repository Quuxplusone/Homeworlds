Homeworlds Online (SDG# 32351)
Variants: "Hard time"
Started: 2017.6.19, Ended: 2017.6.20
Participants: Ausmuh (S), Felix (N)
Winner: Felix

1) Felix: Pass

2) Ausmuh: Homeworld G3 R1 B3
	Felix: Hello again! I wanted to see if the system would just let me pass my first turn since I actually tend to prefer going second. It does! If you'd also rather go second, though, just pass again and I'll take my turn first.
	Ausmuh: Hey, groovy! No worries here, I've thought about that myself. It seems Pyramid Arcade has encouraged some interesting thoughts for Homeworlds. I saw the thread at BGG a player exploring same sized homeworlds as an option too.
 
This is the only game I'm starting this time so I shouldn't overwhelm myself! GL;HF

3) Felix: Homeworld R2 B2 G3 *

4) Ausmuh: Build B1 Ausmuh
	Felix: That player on BGG was actually me! Haha, thanks for reminding me that I want to experiment with it more!
	Ausmuh: That's awesome! I really think there is something there and it's just uncharted territory. I look forward to seeing that chapter develop.

Move R1 Felix Ausmuh

22) Ausmuh: Attack R1N Ausmuh
	Felix: Not positive if this will work out... but here goes!
	Ausmuh: I was wishing I could attack both of those when they came. :) Stressful being connected like this. I like it!

23) Felix: Build R2 Ausmuh
Catastrophe Ausmuh Red

24) Ausmuh: Trade B1 R1 Ausmuh
	Felix: It definitely changes the tone of the whole game and makes it much more intense rather than being a slow, more casual build in the beginning like most games!

25) Felix: Build Y2 Felix

26) Ausmuh: Discover Y2 Zog G1 Alt

27) Felix: Build G1 Felix

28) Ausmuh: Build G2 Zog
	Ausmuh: My green might face the same fate! I could really use a R2 to quell this uprising.

29) Felix: Sacrifice Y2 Felix
Move G3 Felix Ausmuh
Move G1 Felix Ausmuh
	Ausmuh: If I move a y2 in to apply pressure, you simply attack it. It doesn't seem like I could take your ships faster then you could blow up my green. Hmmm

30) Ausmuh: Attack G3N Ausmuh
	Felix: Yeah, I think I'll be able to blow up your star first!
This has been a strange game, but pretty fun! If you want to have a rematch, we can play a more normal game that isn't so tight.
	Ausmuh: All's fair in love and war. :) I don't mind losing to small universes. I dig the unexplored. But I will accept your standing challenge again for sure.
 
I liked your clever thinking on passing the first turn and I think small universes have a place in the game. Also curious about identical homeworlds too.

31) Felix: Build G2 Ausmuh
Catastrophe Ausmuh Green
	Felix: Very fun little game! Thanks for playing. I do think there are untapped possibilities when it comes to intentionally creating a tiny universe with same size stars, but I haven't really figured them out yet. I think the game is balanced enough that it won't have a HUGE impact on the strategy, but I do love finding those little nuances to this game that make a difference!
 
I look forward to our rematch. I just set up an unrated standing challenge if you want to play without putting your rating on the line every time.
