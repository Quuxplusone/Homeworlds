Catastrophe Zoltar Green

	zoltar: Thanks, this was my first game.  I'm not even sure what happened!
	TwoShort: Well you were doing fine until you built a third green at your homeworld when I had one in striking distance.  It's sort of the classic early-game blunder.  Anyway, anytime you'd like to play again, just let me know; I'll even try to be a bit less cut-throat :)
