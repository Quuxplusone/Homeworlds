Werebear: Intergalatic News Services has learned that a horrible calamity has struck in the agentofchaos home system. During a brilliantly executed fireworks display, that drew fascinated audiences from as far away as Mengubah, the star fleets orbiting the home world began colliding. Apparently, the fireworks had a mesmerizing quality that distracted the star ship crews, and before it was all done, thousands of lifeboats had launched down. All hands from all vessels survived, and the agentofchaosians thought that the gigantic star ship explosions were just part of the show. Happy partying continued long into the night, as the lifeboats landed with great relief and celebration.
agentofchaos: Hmm, an investigation is being launched into those fireworks... Foul play is suspected...
