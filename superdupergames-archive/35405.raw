	Draw5PlayAll: How exactly do you run your AI? Do you just put the position into the computer, ask for ai_move, and then manually convert it into SDG notation? Or something else?

Build Y1 Gamma
Build B1 Greed
Build G3 Draw5playall
	ajo: Essentially yes. As of a month-ish ago, you can run it with `--sdg` to get the output automatically in SDG notation. I'm haphazardly working on something that could slurp the game transcript from SDG, reconstruct the position, and then submit its move automatically. But for now it's still mostly manual.

Attack: /A fight broke out in the ([]) system! (\w+)'s (\w\d) ship was overtaken by (\w+)./
Construct: /(\w+) created an? (\w\d) ship in the ([]) system./
Trade: /(\w+) traded their old (\w\d) ship for a shiny new (\w\d) ship in the ([]) system./
Move: /(\w+) moved their (\w\d) ship from ([]) to ([])./
Discover: /(\w+)'s ship (\w\d) ventured forth from ([]) and discovered a new (\w\d) system! It has been named ([])./
Sacrifice: /(\w+)'s ship (\w\d) was sacrificed in the ([]) system./
 
Inside the []'s you need to know all the valid characters for system names.
	Draw5PlayAll: [A-Za-z0-9_-'] to be exact.
