	nycavri: TaGG!

2) Draw5PlayAll: Homeworld B1 R3 G3

3) nycavri: Build G1 Nycavri

4) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: Interesting. You appear to have skilled explorers in your home world but you lack a planetary defense system. We are going to build another construction ship before taking on any adventurous actions.

5) nycavri: T G1 Y1 Nycavri

6) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall
	nycavri: We come in peace . . . ?
	Draw5PlayAll: We are risk-takers, and we build another construction ship in our system. There is no risk of a suicide bomber blowing up all our green.

7) nycavri: D Y1 Nycavri B3 Deacon
	nycavri: Yet . . .

8) Draw5PlayAll: Trade G1 Y1 Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: I take note of your actions and decide to implement warp drives in one of the small Constellation-class ships. As always, we have to remove the construction capabilities.

9) nycavri: Build G1 Nycavri

10) Draw5PlayAll: Build Y2 Draw5playall
	nycavri: Looks like you're all set to escalate  / accelerate . . .
	Draw5PlayAll: Ah, but we have an Ambassador-class movement ship in our system. We hope to use it to explore strange new worlds.

11) nycavri: S G1 Nycavri
Build Y2 Deacon

12) Draw5PlayAll: Discover Y2 Draw5playall G2 Greenville
	nycavri: And you've stolen tempo . . .
	Draw5PlayAll: Well, in that case... We discovered a medium-sized planet covered in forest. The local aliens have construction facilities that we could use to our advantage. 

13) nycavri: T Y2 G2 Deacon

14) Draw5PlayAll: Build Y2 Greenville
	nycavri: Not enjoying how loneyly my mothership is . . .
	Draw5PlayAll: We're building another Ambassador class ship with warp drives.

15) nycavri: B G1 Nycavri

16) Draw5PlayAll: Build Y2 Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: Hmmm... I could sac the G1 and build three times but I don't think I have enough influence. Instead we decided to build an Ambassador-class movement ship.

	Draw5PlayAll: What's interesting is that even though I am in danger of an overpopulation (I have 3 of a color in two systems) but you can't get anything there to call.

20) Draw5PlayAll: Trade G1 B1 Draw5playall

21) nycavri: T G3 Y3 Deacon

	Draw5PlayAll: We have successfully launched an invasion force to the base of those two mean attackers. Our long-range action technology used the Galaxy-class warp ship in BigOcean to move three suicide yellow ships into your homeworld. The energy from the ranged action system destroyed the four warp drive ships and your small yellow planet.
	nycavri: Thanks for the game, perhaps the favorite Homeworlds contest I have played.  You mentioned Bluebird, then missed the fact that destroying my yellow world would give me direct access to your own Homeworld . . .
	Draw5PlayAll: Actually, I knew it too late. I was hoping you wouldn't realize it. I didn't have much else anyway. Oddly enough, your planned attack would NOT have connected our homeworlds.
	Draw5PlayAll: Interestingly enough, it moved my homeworld into the middle fray, as if it was simply another star system.
