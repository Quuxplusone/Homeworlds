	Trydnt: Do you have a name for this situation? I call them poisoned stars
	Trydnt: Mostly because in Ice Towers I called towers poisoned towers when they had two pieces of the same color at the top and the top one was small since anyone who put a piece on top of those would immediately lose that piece to a split
	Babamots: I don't have any other name for it, so poisoned star sounds pretty good. Got any other terms that should go in my glossary? I'm assembling on here:

	Draw5PlayAll: - "Crash" an investment (e.g. my G1 is investing at a star, so you send your R2)
- Banker, Goldilocks, Fortress
- Borg: A large ship (usually red) sent to a peripheral system of only smalls and mediums (or a medium sent to a system of all smalls). Resistance is not entirely futile because you can often sac one of the ships and move others away, but it is still annoying.
- "Undermine": blowing up a populated enemy colony by sending in 3 ships to explode the star. I always envision this as sending in smalls and mediums to destroy a system with 1-2 larges because you can't use a Borg.
- "Slow Undermine": the above, but in 2 separate turns; like the Borg, the opponent has 1 turn to evacuate as many ships as possible.
 
"Gilligans" can also be useful outposts for trying to destroy your opponent's red star.
	Trydnt: There is a super-slow undermine too where you can move all three in one at a time so long as the second one big enough to attack all the ships there (and you have red) so they're forced to attack it and can't move out the first one. It's a good way to clinch a win if you are short on Y3 pieces in the late game
	Trydnt: I always called crash a hostile takeover
	Trydnt: Wil and I called stars that neither could access from their homeworlds no man's land. Might be worth including with a mention that depending on which half of their star you blow up that star might now be closer to their homeworld. Also since you can get to both your colonies and your opponents colonies from there, having two ships of the same color in no man's land, along with a y2 piece means you can sac the y2 and move them to any colony to destroy 2 opponent ships of that same color.

	Babamots: I may want to take a couple of days to come back to this with a fresh perspective. I've started to have dreams about this game, which always means I've been overthinking.
	Trydnt: If I'm feeling particularly stuck sometimes I'll build the universe with my pyramids and see if that helps me see any new pathways. The chaotic arrangement of tiles on SDG can obscure some things

65) Trydnt: Sacrifice Y3 G2
Move G1 Risa Betazed
Move G2 Risa Betazed
Move G1 Trydnt Betazed
Catastrophe Betazed G
	Babamots: I set up the pyramids sometimes if I need to explore lots of possible futures. I can usually work through "feeling stuck" on SDG's display.

	Babamots: Shoot, I wish I'd been in position to move when you made that first move. Well, I think that's me done in. GG!
	Trydnt: well played. this seemed the slower route to victory but definitely more certain
