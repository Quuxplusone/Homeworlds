	Draw5PlayAll: Why are the pieces arranged pseudo-randomly in a 5x5 grid?

28) Felix: Build G2 Felix
	Felix: You mean why does the visual layout differ each time? Not sure. There must be some algorithm telling it how to lay out the grid depending on which systems are created first. And then the ships just spawn randomly in each block I suppose.

30) Felix: Sacrifice G3 Felix
Build G3 Felix
Build Y3 Wild
Build Y3 Erness
	Draw5PlayAll: Like how wild is actually on my side while Icehouse and erness are on yours? I hope SDG2.0 puts them in a better position relating more to the connections.
	Felix: *shrug* I don't know how it works, really. I've just gotten kind of used to seeing the connections wherever they are, rather than needing them to be laid out in order. It may not make that much sense, but then again, we are in outer space :)

I could delay the game for 4 more moves but there is no point.

Catastrophe Draw5playall Green
