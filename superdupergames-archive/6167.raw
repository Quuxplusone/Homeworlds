Homeworlds Online (SDG# 6167)
Started: 2007.1.27, Ended: 2007.4.23
Participants: jan (S), Keith (N)
Winner: Keith

1) Keith: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3

2) jan: Homeworld G2 Y3 B3
Keith: Hello jan. Welcome to SDG and have a good game.
jan: Hey Kieth, i am excited to try this. i have played the table top version of homeworlds before. i think im getting how to write orders. thanks jan
jan: Kieth, Do you know why i am getting the message that there are no G2 or Y3pieces in the stash left?
Keith: That is a mystery to me. My order looked like this:

3) Keith: Build G1 Keith

4) jan: Build B1 Jan
jan: hey thanks i got it! is there a way to name your systems? also what does the setting 2/2/8 mean?

5) Keith: Discover G1 Keith Y3 Midworld
Keith: Whenever you discover a new system you will get to name it. For example "discover g1 keith y3 Midworld"

6) jan: Build B1 Jan
Keith: The 2/2/8 means you start with two days to make a move, each move adds to days to your remaining time, the maximum is 8 days. That way if you run into an emergency or even take a week off you don't run out of time to move. Though I won't force a surrender if I know the other player needs extra time.

7) Keith: Build G1 Keith

8) jan: Trade B1 G1 Jan

9) Keith: Trade G1 B1 Keith
jan: hey Kieth i saw someone posted a homeworlds challenge that says "hard time" and ladder challenge or something and it didn't have a join game option on the right do you know what this means?

10) jan: Build B2 Jan

11) Keith: Build B2 Keith
Keith: There is a Homeworlds ladder. Sort of like an ongoing king of the hill competition Homeworlds style. GreedyAlgorithm has directly challenged eugman to a match. Hard time means there would be an automatic forfeit if someone ran out of time to make their move.

jan: that looks a little more reasonable ...
Keith: The homeworld yellow catastrophe would have been a disadvantage for me but not as much as my being able to put a g3 in your home system backed by an r1. Now that you have a red backup I better do something about the yellow situation.

jan: sorry my internet has been down
Keith: Glad to see you made it back and that it was not something like your health going down.

jan: good game
jan: i will start a new life on the lovely planet of goblin
Keith: Thank you for the game. Have you thought about joining the Ladder?
jan: Im afraid im a poor play by internet player. i find that i am constantly getting sucked up into other aspects of life and keep going over time.

Keith: Your going overtime was not a problem for me. Perhaps we will have that SDG face to face gathering some day and you can have at me in real time.
