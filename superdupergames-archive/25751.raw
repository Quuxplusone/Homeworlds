1) wil: H B2 R1 G3
	wil: Procedural question, I had a challenge against Zoltar in play.  It was neither accepted or rejected as far as I can see... What happens there?
	wil: I gueSs if they don't answer -kll start...but where did you come from outta the blue?  Undefeated in Zemdo or HW... Impressive climb on the ladder...everently no newbie...  
	TeeTeeTee: Heh, I'm not sure what to say to that. I'm not sure how your challenge to zoltar was deleted, but as (at the time) all the players above you were inactive or playing ladder games, and as you had asked to play another binary game with me at some point, I thought you'd be fine with accepting a ladder challenge...

2) TeeTeeTee: Homeworld B1 Y3 G3
