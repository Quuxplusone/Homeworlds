Participants: Babamots (S), BlueSkies (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) BlueSkies: Homeworld R1 B2 G3
	Babamots: So this is from my "training game challenge." Are you a pretty new player?

2) Babamots: Homeworld G3 Y2 B3

3) BlueSkies: Build G1 Blueskies
	BlueSkies: Hi Babamots, I am a complete beginner.

4) Babamots: Build B1 Babamots

5) BlueSkies: Trade G1 Y1 Blueskies
	Babamots: Well, so far so good! Let me know any time you'd like help analyzing the position. I'll start saying stuff about the game spontaneously when it's a little more complicated.
	BlueSkies: Ok this is great. I appreciate any advice you may have.

6) Babamots: Build B1 Babamots
	BlueSkies: I was wondering, what is the usual protocol on superdupergames? Do games tend to be played in realtime or over a matter of days?

7) BlueSkies: Discover Y1 Blueskies G3 Biggreen

8) Babamots: Discover B1 Babamots G1 Betazed
	Babamots: Right now, I'm trying to build all the little blue ships so that you can't trade any of your little ships to get blue (this is "freezing you out" of blue). You are in a good position to try to do the same to me but with yellow. Neither of us will succeed unless the other makes a mistake, though.

	BlueSkies: Sorry, I hate to do this, but I think I will have to come back to game at some later point. Thanks again though.
	Babamots: It's normal for purple to only make one or two moves a day (sometimes less). It's fine if you're now leaving for a day or two. If you'll be gone more than a week, we'll need to pause the timer. Also, I composed my last chat before you moved. I will be able to freeze you out of blue now.
	Babamots: Purple=people. That's the trouble with typing on a phone at the bus stop.
