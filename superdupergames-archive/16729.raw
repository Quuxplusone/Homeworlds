22) ZackStack: Trade G2 Y2 Deepsea
	ZackStack: I could have sacrificed the y2 in my home system to send one of my greens from DeepSea to your homeworld to cause a catastrophe... you might want to do something about that :-)
	daselva: hello Zack thank you for your generousity...I´m a beginner and I´m trying to understand this game that I´m finding very intersting.The present situation is a new and interestingsituation for me.I´ve played like I did because I thought that by not having yellow power in DeepSEa you could´t go from there to my HW.Besides the two systemes are not conected... What can you tell me about this?
	daselva: hello again...I understand that by sacrificing y2 in your HW you could bring one of  your greens from DeepSea to blue and then from there to my HW,but once again,there is no yellow power in Blue...

23) daselva: Trade B1 Y1 Blue
	ZackStack: By sacrificing a ship of a certain color you may use its power even in a system that does not have that color.  For instance if you sacrificed the Y1 at your homeworld you would be able to move one of your ships at Blue.  This can lead to some very unexpected moves!
