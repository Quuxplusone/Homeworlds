16) MadWuher: Build B2 Edora
	mschlat: Okay, this is about the place where I'm feeling pretty lost.  About the only thing I'm focused on is not giving you a chance to build a 2 ship.
	MadWuher: you'll notice that I already have access to the size 2 ships (blue in this case) while you don't have any blues available. Some ways to fix this: trade your G3 for a B3 and then create B ships, take control of another colour (all that seems to be left that I don't have is Red).You'll notice I chose blue because a b1 was already used in your homeworld giving me a quicker monopoly.

17) mschlat: Build R1 Mschlat
	MadWuher: At this point, I have a few options. Keep building the blues until I get to size 3, or start diversifying my colours at the Edora system. Let me warn you, that if you trade your g3 for a b3, you will be 1 step closer to a blue catastrophe in your homeworld (and you won't be able to build anything there anymore).

18) MadWuher: Build B2 Madwuher
	mschlat: Yes, I don't like the G3 for B3 option.  I'll try more focus on red.

31) mschlat: Discover R1 Mschlat G2 Oneaway2
	MadWuher: One thing to think about, you have no size 3 ships in your home system. If I can move a size 3 ship there then you cannot attack it (you can only attack ships the same size or less than the largest ship you have there) and I can start to attack your ships. The other thing you should think about, since I now have access to yellow (and can use a sacrifice to move any of my ships) I can move my R2 from Edora into your home system (discovering another planet if I have to) and cause a catastrophe there, leaving you no ships in your homeworld (so I would win).

	MadWuher: Thanks for the game. Want to play another? Feel free to ask me any questions you may have about homeworlds.
	mschlat: Yeah, I'd like to play another, but I don't understand what happened in this one.  It's hard for me to see what happens as a result of sacrifice (so I don't understand the last turn and how I've lost).  I'm going to try and review with some Icehouse pieces.
	MadWuher: sacrifice a red piece and attack at any system (as long as the ship I use is = or greater in size than yours). sacrifice an r2, get 2 attacks.
	mschlat: I finally figured that out - I was thinking the B3 was in my system to set up a catastrophe later on, not give you a chance to use a red sacrifice.
	mschlat: Yes, I'd like to play another.  How do we do that?
	MadWuher: I was about to say "choose one of my challenges from the challenges screen" but I think it might be better for you to setup a new challenge against me. Select the "challenges" screen, scroll down to homeworlds, and click "New Challenge". In the next screen, you can choose any of the options you want, and choose MadWuher from the "challenge whom" option. This sets up a challenge against me of your choosing. Otherwise, you can select any of the other open challenges that I or other players have available.
