	Babamots: I like this situation a little better than before my move, mostly since we're now even on large ships.

81) Felix: Build Y2 Felix

82) Babamots: Attack R1N Cardassia
	Felix: Yeah, I think I am actually worse off at the moment after you got my r2.
 
In an unrelated note, I finished my first game against wil and filled out the game end form, but it looks like the tournament table didn't update but still says the game is in progress. There was no place to enter the game number on the game end form. Is it something you just manually update, or do I need to do something else?

83) Felix: Discover Y2 Felix G1 Glorfindel
	Babamots: The tournament table only looks the player names from the finish form. The table should be showing the winner. I'll investigate.

84) Babamots: Trade Y1 G1 Babamots
	Babamots: Found the problem. Each form submission created a new row on the spreadsheet, and references to the top row were automatically changed to refer to the next row down (to the old empty cell). It's fixed now.

	Felix: Good game! That was a fun one. You put up a heck of a fight with all those unexpected aggressive catastrophes on me. I like that aggressive play... loads of fun. Thanks for playing and setting up this tourney!
	Babamots: Looks like I missed something. I'll have to go back and see what happened.
	Babamots: Yeach, standard Bluebird. I was really looking forward to beating you. Maybe next time.
	Felix: You gave me a run for my money, for sure. Excellent play! I'm sure we'll meet again in the bracket, and you may take me down when it really counts!
	Babamots: I'm kicking myself pretty hard because I got up in material and then just got sloppy. Good luck in your other games! I hope I can make it into the bracket to face you again!
