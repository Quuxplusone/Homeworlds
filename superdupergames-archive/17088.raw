Catastrophe Rootbier Y
	rootbier: guess i did it again. you have found my very clear weakness.

17) AdamBadura: Build R1 Adambadura
	rootbier: i must say that i find your backlash against my needing extra time on the last game (no undo/very short clock) to be more than a little off-putting. i'd go so far as to say it seems childishly vindicative.
	AdamBadura: I didn't temper with time. It was a default one. I shut off Undo indeed. Actually for no reason. Or to be more specific we decided to play so with my friends. I even actually prefer to play with Undo. But still mechanically I turned it off. Sorry for that. Next time I will try to remember that you prefer Undo.
	AdamBadura: As for your style of playing. I think you keep making a mistake of not having R technology. I prefer to have R3 ship in my homeworld. But an R1 builded later will do as well in many cases. But you have not R ship at all...

18) rootbier: Trade G1 R1 Rootbier
	rootbier: Standard clock is 3(start)/1(inc)/10(max) -- you must have accidentally bumped of the "0" at the end. It looked pushy after our previous conversation about time and thinking and life chaos. Sorry for the accusation.
 
And yeah I'm simply not used to no-undo -- I find it too hard to visualize certain things online.
 
I am in no way unclear on the way I have been screwing up. And I know how to defend myself -- used to always grab myself an r1 at home... but lately I have been shying more and more away from red. I simply don't like the color :D 
Very few people have made anything out of it - but then I think most don't start with an R3.
	rootbier: or.... not too hard to visualize ... but too easy to miss certain things.

	rootbier: GAH! No undo! and I forgot to trigger my cat cuz i spent so long deciing on the non-yellow move action. I would take it as a real kindness if you would consider those yellow ships at home dead and trigger the cat yourself at the end of the turn.
