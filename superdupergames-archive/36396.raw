Homeworlds Online (SDG# 36396)
Variants: "Sinister"
Started: 2020.6.5, Ended: 2020.7.22
Participants: Draw5PlayAll (S), eliscinsky (W), capi3101 (N), dimitrivv (E)
Winner: capi3101

1) capi3101: Homeworld G1 B3 Y3
	capi3101: Greetings all, and best of luck.

2) dimitrivv: Homeworld R3 G1 B3

3) Draw5PlayAll: Homeworld B2 R1 G3
	dimitrivv: Hi all, my first multiplayer game, I'm excited. I'll try not to make it end too quickly... :) GG

4) eliscinsky: H B3 R2 G3
	Draw5PlayAll: I should have an easy time with two G1s gone...
	dimitrivv: I actually see that I already made capi3101's life easy to come visit me... that was a quick bad start... :S

5) capi3101: Build Y1 Capi3101
	eliscinsky: Greetings everyone. I hope this is a good game for everyone. Please remember this is a Sinister game. So your focus will be the person to your left to attack and remove, but Beware of the person to your right as they will be doing the same to you. Good luck, have fun, here we go.
	capi3101: Okay...so dimitrivv is my target and eliscinsky is going to try to do me in. 
 
Green is going to disappear pretty fast, looks like. 
	capi3101: Still starts the same way.

6) dimitrivv: Build B1 Dimitrivv
	Draw5PlayAll: I think I will go ahead and target dimitrivv because e will be attacking me and I do not want capi to steal a quick win.
 
Then again, maybe capi emself is a better target...

7) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall
	dimitrivv: I guess I'll have to juggle my defense against two then :S but if I can, I will probably have to focus on attacking capi3101 just to get the threat out of the way myself, since I'm too much of an easy target with these stars otherwise...
	capi3101: I suppose all of y'all might be situational targets. I mean, I don't have a direct quarrel with Draw5PlayAll, but I might have to make moves to foil your plays if, as a result of them, you wind up winning the whole shebang.
 
This could be a very interesting match...
	capi3101: Changing topics, when it comes to naming new systems, what conventions do y'all use? My own self, I either do the NATO phoetic or the Hebrew Alphabet. Lately I've been doing the two of them backwards.
	eliscinsky: As for naming systems .. I use either Star Trek worlds, or fruit names, or sometimes codes like G3a, or just random names.  LOL sorry.  Think I'll try fruit and veggie names this game.

8) eliscinsky: B G1 Eliscinsky
	Draw5PlayAll: You may or may not be able to figure out MY current naming conventions as a result of this game.
 
Obviously my previous post was a total bluff designed to trick eliscinsky into a false sense of security. After all, I would *never* come out and admit something like that directly without hiding something behind my back...
 
...or was it?

9) capi3101: Build Y1 Capi3101
	eliscinsky: LOL!

10) dimitrivv: Trade B3 Y3 Dimitrivv

11) Draw5PlayAll: Trade G1 Y1 Draw5playall
	dimitrivv: I don't have a star naming convention, so I'll probably make names up on the spot :)
 
And regarding strategy, I think I stated the obvious, actual strategy of course will depend on the play state :P

Discover R1 Pea G2 Avacado
	dimitrivv: I couldn't find the info: how do you use the sacrifice and catastrophe actions on SDG? Do you give all commands at once, or one after the other? (but then, how does the game know to wait before handing over the turn?)
	capi3101: You just put them in line by line. So you'd start with "s y3 dimitrivv" on the first line, then below it you'd type "m b1 dimittrivv Tav" on the line below that. For any sacrifice plays to which you're entitled but which you don't want to move, you'd put "pass" on a line by itself. And then the catastrophe plays are in whatever piece of the sequence you'd want them in, but again they're on their own line.
	capi3101: Andy Looney recently posted a rather clever situation on Facebook where the player catastrophed their own star early on in the sequence to free up the material needed to catastrophe their opponent's homeworld for the win...
	capi3101: (No wishful thinking going on in the examples there on my first post. Just clarifying. Nope. None whatsoever...)
	Draw5PlayAll: You realize that if dmitrivv suicides then you do not get credit because ey didn't die by YOUR move? You would just have to target me.

	dimitrivv: Haha yeah, I thought of spicing things up a bit with the reds :D
I've played just a few games of Homeworlds so far and this is my first multiplayer, but I'm having a blast! So simple yet so strategic and varied!
	capi3101: Y'all are focusing too heavily on red. Quoth Scotty: "Without engines, there'd be no fighting..."
	capi3101: Now that I've said that...

	Draw5PlayAll: In all seriousness, I'm predicting capi will win.

87) Draw5PlayAll: Build Y1 Draw5playall

94) dimitrivv: S G2 Mystique

101) capi3101: Discover Y1 Resh B3 Tsade

102) dimitrivv: Move B1 Heh Clover
	capi3101: Going to come up at least one short.

103) Draw5PlayAll: Move Y3 Mystique Tav
	dimitrivv: Well, I was half forced to do this and it was too cool not to do it anyway :P I think this helped capi a lot in the end but well... we'll see.
	dimitrivv: There were too many ships on Avacado.
	eliscinsky: Well, that's what happens when you put all your eggs in one basket. Guess I rolled a 1.  Time to rethink and start over.
	eliscinsky: And yes, capi no longer has to worry about me attacking and can focus completely on you dimitrivv. 
	Draw5PlayAll: Capi, you know you can't win if dimitrivv kills me first...

104) eliscinsky: Sacrifice Y3 Eliscinsky

	eliscinsky: Hmmm, the banter is getting interesting. LOL

105) capi3101: Build Y3 Resh
	capi3101: Wow...I need to come see what's going on between turns more often...
	capi3101: I'm reasonably certain you're not in danger of elimination, Draw5PlayAll...
	capi3101: ...though as expected, the game has gotten very interesting. Do you assist the player who's attempting to kill you by attacking the player trying to kill them, or not? We've seen it once already.
	capi3101: I do this wrong and I imagine we'll see it again...
	Draw5PlayAll: In a sense, we have an uneasy alliance. You want to destroy east, and I want east NOT to destroy me.
	capi3101: On the other hand, if I make a move that would result in dimitrivv's defeat on the next turn, and he lacks the resources needed to deflect said attack, it would fall on the other two of you to come to his aid or lose the game yourselves...
 
I think I still want to maintain the status quo. For now at least.

106) dimitrivv: Move B1 Clover Draw5playall

107) Draw5PlayAll: Sacrifice R1 Dreams

110) dimitrivv: Discover Y1 Clover G2 Envy
	capi3101: My star empire is now listed on Uber, apparently.
	capi3101: Got a bad feeling about what's going to happen this round, but it may turn out better than I suspect it will.
	eliscinsky: PSA: From the Looney Labs HW Rules PDF.
 
Sinister Homeworlds: In this variation, your goal is to eliminate the person currently to your left. If anyone else causes that player's elimination, then the game continues without them. Eliminated players pieces remain in play.
 
MY take ... If you don't eliminate the player to your left ... you don't win.  Until you eliminate the NEW player to your left.
	Draw5PlayAll: Yeah, I think if, say, I were to die not by dimitrivv's actions, then they would have to kill eliscinsky.

111) Draw5PlayAll: Trade B1 R1 Draw5playall
	dimitrivv: I don't really have good moves :)

112) eliscinsky: Trade G1 B1 Eliscinsky
	Draw5PlayAll: Neither do I.

113) capi3101: Attack R2E Clover

	capi3101: Let's try changing the plan slightly...

115) Draw5PlayAll: Sacrifice Y3 Rocket
Move Y3 Tav Dimitrivv
Move R3 Dreams Dimitrivv
Discover B1 Dreams Y3 Recycling
	dimitrivv: Draw5 hypnosis... "build B2 Draw5PlayAll... build B2 Draw5PlayAll... build B2 Draw5PlayAll..." :D (although that wouldn't necessarily make me win)
	dimitrivv: actually, that's probably the only way to slow down capi?
	dimitrivv: I unwillingly probably suggested his best move :P (since capi's victory is as much his loss as it is mine)
	dimitrivv: for completeness at this point, capi would then be forced to sacrifice a Y3 to catastrophe yellow on Envy
	dimitrivv: (I would normally avoid suggesting upcoming moves explicitly like this; in fact my initial comment was meant as a gaming suicide joke... and it's impossible to delete the comments)

	Draw5PlayAll: Then again, maybe not...

121) capi3101: Move R2 Shin Dimitrivv
Catastrophe Dimitrivv R
	Draw5PlayAll: Yeah, I have to.

122) dimitrivv: B B2 Dimitrivv
	eliscinsky: I think it's aboot to get wery interesting!
	capi3101: Well, crap.
	capi3101: Ill either win or lose it right here. Might as well try for the win.

123) Draw5PlayAll: Trade G3 Y3 Dimitrivv
	capi3101: Action Stations.
	eliscinsky: CAn a single player own two (2) binary star systems?  I suppose you can.
 
As I said ... It's getting VERY interesting.
	dimitrivv: It's crowded in here... 

124) eliscinsky: Build G1 Eliscinsky

125) capi3101: Sacrifice Y2 Blueberry
Move R3 Clover Tav
Move R3 Tav Capi3101
	Draw5PlayAll: Well, fortunately for me, capi seriously weakened themselves with that attack... (actually, we are ALL rather weak...)
 
I think the moment East loses their last ship the dimitrivv system loses its significance as a Homeworld system.

126) dimitrivv: Trade B2 R2 Dimitrivv
	capi3101: Yep. That went about like I thought it would. Back to the drawing board for us all...

127) Draw5PlayAll: Sacrifice R1 Draw5playall
Attack R2E Dimitrivv

128) eliscinsky: Discover R2 Eliscinsky G1 Kiwi
	dimitrivv: Probably won't last long at this point :) but it was a fun first multiplayer

129) capi3101: Trade R1 Y1 Capi3101

130) dimitrivv: B B1 Dimitrivv
	Draw5PlayAll: I can let eliscinsky do the honors.
	eliscinsky: Well, as gracious as that offer from Draw5PlayAll is, I believe that honor should go to capi3101.  It is after all his responsibility to remove his left hand opponent.
 
To that end I grant thee dimitrivv a boon. That boon is a "stay of execution" and is so ordered, and is to last one turn (mine).  Good Luck dimitrivv!
 
Happy hunting capi3101.
 
P.S. I hope I don't regret this.

131) Draw5PlayAll: Move R2 Dimitrivv Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: You see, I am intentionally trying NOT to let capi be the one to defeat dimitrivv, so that I still have some chance of winning.
	capi3101: Looks like you get to live to fight another day, dimitrivv. Don't waste the opportunity.
	capi3101: Myself, I'm looking at Babamots's list of red flags. I've got number four going on right now, and I need to rectify that ASAP.
 
I won't call it a 'mistake', but that attack sequence cost me dearly...

132) eliscinsky: Build Y2 Eliscinsky

133) capi3101: Sacrifice Y1 Tsade
Move R2 Clover Tav

134) dimitrivv: S B1 Tav

	Draw5PlayAll: Oh hey, thanks for that red.

135) Draw5PlayAll: Sacrifice R2 Draw5playall
Attack R2E Dimitrivv
Attack B1E Dimitrivv
	eliscinsky: So I got it on good authority that if Draw5PlayAll (S) takes out dimitrivv (E), then capi3101 (N) will have to eliminate Draw5PlayAll's original (S) HW instead.  As Draw5PlayAll will become the new player to his left.  The captured (E) HW is no longer a target, but just another star system.

136) capi3101: Pass
	Draw5PlayAll: I hope this is how SDG implemented it, anyway.
	eliscinsky: True.  There is that.

137) Draw5PlayAll: Pass

143) Draw5PlayAll: Move B2 Dimitrivv Shin

144) eliscinsky: Build B2 Kiwi
	Draw5PlayAll: Hold it. Eliscinsky got skipped. Please undo your move and pass, and then I will also pass and we can right this.
	eliscinsky: Okay, why was I passed over?  It should have been my turn.  I've seen this in another SDG 4 player HW game, that when one play is eliminated the next player sequence goes crazy and skips the next logical player.
 
capi3101 are you willing to undo your turn and pass?
Then Draw5PlayAll also pass?
All to allow me a fair turn.
 
V/R (W)
	eliscinsky: Hey TY Draw5PlayAll
	eliscinsky: capi3101 I promise not to take your r1 -- LOL
	Draw5PlayAll: My best guess is that SDG calculates the current turn based on N mod P, where N is the number of moves and P is the number of players.
So N was, say, 50 = 4*12 + 2, which would make it my turn (since I went after 2 players).
After I killed east P became 3 but N was 51 which is divisible by 3 and thus it thinks it is capi's turn (who went first).
	Draw5PlayAll: What is V/R (W) by the way?
	eliscinsky: V/R = Very Respectifully
	dimitrivv: so it happened... :P my moves were quite dumb anyway at that point... I'll monitor the rest of the game, good luck :)
	dimitrivv: btw, I understood that in multiplayer games, if a player is eliminated, all the assets would stay on the board as normal stars and neutral ships (that can be captured); but in this case my homeworld and any ships there got removed from the board... sounds like a bug?
	dimitrivv: oh, nevermind, my homeworld simply got rearranged, I should have checked better the star names before commenting
	capi3101: Sorry, y'all. I may have mentioned a while back that I need to come by more often to see where things are between turns. Move will be undone momentarily.
