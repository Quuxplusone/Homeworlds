16) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots
	Babamots: The new stuff isn't really in the spirit of Star Trek. I'm all about TNG.

17) Layana: Trade G1 B1 Layana
	Layana: I loved TNG, too, and really enjoyed DS9. 

18) Babamots: Trade G1 B1 Babamots
	Babamots: My wife and I watched all of DS9 together and now we're working on TNG. She likes DS9 better overall, but I hope she would agree that many individual TNG episodes are better than all but a few DS9.

19) Layana: Discover Y2 Layana R3 Trill
	Layana: I think that's a fact. There are so many brilliant TNG episodes. It's the metaplot that makes DS9 great (starting at season 3).
