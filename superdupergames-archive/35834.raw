Homeworlds Online (SDG# 35834)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2020.1.2, Ended: 2020.1.6
Participants: Donegal (S), Babamots (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) Babamots: Homeworld B3 Y1 G3
	Babamots: Hi Donegal! I don't remember seeing you around before. Are you brand new?

2) Donegal: Homeworld G3 Y1 B3

3) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots
	Donegal: Yes, it's my first game
	Babamots: I'm glad you're trying it out! This is pretty much my favorite game.
 
Let me know if you have any trouble with the commands or other questions. Anything you do to build more ships and diversify is fine for a couple of moves.
 
Since our homeworlds have the same size stars, it'll be a "small universe" game, which tends to be a little shorter.

4) Donegal: Build B1 Donegal

5) Babamots: Trade G1 Y1 Babamots
	Babamots: I'm afraid your choice of homeworld stars is about to put you in a bad position. It will be educational though. :-)
 
I hope you don't mind some heavy advice/teaching....
 
I'm going to trade my g1 for the last y1 piece. You won't be able to trade your b1 for y1, so you'll have to find another way to get yellow. Here are the choices I see:
1) wait until you get a medium ship of some other color and trade for a y2,
2) trade your b3 for y3 right away,
3) get locked out of yellow permanently (almost certainly fatal),
 
Option 1 probably won't work. By the time you get a medium blue, I may have used all of the y2 pieces. 
 
Option 2 works pretty well in most games (I do it all the time), but because it's a small universe, I can reach you more quickly. Here's a possible way for the game to go:
 
me:
trade g1 y1 Babamots
(I freeze you out of yellow)
 
you:
trade b3 y3 Donegal
(You get into the yellow economy in the only way you can)
 
me:
build y2 Babamots
 
you:
build y2 Donegal
(You need a second yellow ship if you're going to compete for the yellow pieces)
 
me:
sacrifice y2 Babamots
discover y1 Babamots g2 Whatever
move y1 Whatever Donegal
catastrophe Donegal y
(You lose a home star and your only large ship. There's no coming back from such an early, heavy loss)
 
BUT, instead of building the y2 in your homeworld, you could move you y3 to a new g2 system in order to build in a place where there isn't a yellow star to mess you up.
 
Long story short, I think you should trade b3 for y3 on this turn.

6) Donegal: Discover B1 Donegal B2 P1
	Donegal: Why cant i move if i have a yellow piramid?
	Babamots: I guess you tried to move to a new system? If you're moving to a new system, you have to use the "discover" command and specify the star type and name of the system you're moving to. For example, if you want to move your b1 to a brand new medium green system and give that system the name Billy, then the command is
 
discover b1 Donegal g2 Billy
 
Or, if you're asking why I was talking about yellow ships so much, it's because they're extremely important for sacrifices and making big attacks. It's almost impossible to win without a few yellow ships that are medium or bigger.

7) Babamots: Build Y2 Babamots

8) Donegal: Trade B1 R1 P1

9) Babamots: Discover Y2 Babamots R2 Romulus

10) Donegal: Build B1 Donegal
	Babamots: When I issued the challenge for this game, I forgot to ask the site to have me go second. I think the first move advantage should usually go to the newer player.
 
I think you should build ships at your home for a turn or two. I'm getting ahead on material.
 
It's worth noting that your red ship is a little stranded at that blue system: can't move, can't build.

11) Babamots: Sacrifice G3 Babamots
Build Y2 Romulus
Build Y2 Romulus
Build Y3 Babamots

12) Donegal: Move B3 Donegal Romulus

13) Babamots: Trade Y3 R3 Babamots
	Babamots: Good! You should pick on enemy systems that have lots of ships smaller than yours.
 
However, you have left your home without a large ship, 
Which is always dangerous. And without yellow power, I think I can now invade your home with a large red before you can defend (I'll sacrifice a y2 to move my r3 your home on my next turn). Major kudos to you if you can find a way to defend this! :-)

14) Donegal: Attack Y2N Romulus

15) Babamots: Sacrifice Y2 Romulus
Move R3 Babamots Romulus
Move R3 Romulus Donegal

	Babamots: I looked closer and you actually can defend this position. If you can't find it, let me know and I'll tell you.
	Babamots: I think maybe you didn't read my advice. Your position isn't as bad as it looks. Your good move is
 
sacrifice y2 Romulus
move r1 b1 Babamots
move b3 Romulus Donegal
 
I have to sacrifice my other y2 to retreat. Otherwise, you'll attack my only home ship and win.
 
Thanks for the game. I hope you learned a little and will want to play again. :-)
