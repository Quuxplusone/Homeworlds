27) andylooney: Sacrifice G1 Clampett
Construct Y3 Bigblue
	andylooney: I'm having a problem here. I should be able to do this:
Sacrifice g1 clampett
construct y3 bigblue
This is a maneuver we call "cashing in an investment." But it's not working! I'm getting this message: "There are insufficient Y3 pieces in the stash." This is true at the start of the turn, but the sacrifice action puts the y3 into the stash, thus allowing my construct action. I think the computer needs to have this fine point explained to it. I need help before I can take my turn!
	rootbeer: I think you're right. Aaron?

	Aaron: If you "sacrifice G1 clampett" then there is no Y being put into the stash, just the G.  I don't see where the yellow piece could come from.
	rootbeer: It's the yellow sun of Clampett, when it's returned to the interstellar flux.

	Aaron: Ahh!  I see now.  You are correct.  This is a bug.  I *think* it's an easy fix.  I'm very distracted at this moment, but I will try to get to it tonight.  Sorry!
	Aaron: OK, I think it works now.  Give it a shot.

28) rootbeer: Sacrifice Y2 Rootbeer
Move Y1 Emerald Bigblue
Move Y2 Emerald Bigblue
Catastrophe Bigblue Y
	andylooney: Yay! He fixed it! Thanks Aaron!
	MatrixFrog: I still say it would be fun to visit the hyperspatial flux. Although I suppose by visiting any star in it, you've automatically pulled it out of the flux. It's like wishing to speak in a silent room.
