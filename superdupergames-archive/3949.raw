6) Keith: Trade G1 Y1 Keith

7) gluco: Discover Y1 Gluco G3 Zx
Keith: I did not intend to mimic your moves but if I did not grab a y1 you could grab it and it would be very difficult for me to get yellow (except for converting my g3).
gluco: Couldn't you build a b1 and trade for y2 later? granted that is 2 moves though

8) Keith: Build Y2 Keith
Keith: I need a b2 to trade for a y2. So it would take a while to work through the b1s and you might work through the y2s at the same time.

Keith: Lets see if this will work.

20) Keith: Attack R3 Gluco
Keith: I think you were focused on sending three yellow ships into Keith and did not realize why I had pulled a gun.
gluco: kewl move...not sure the situation is salvagable the way I understand the rules, but I will try something...

Keith: The only way I saw to draw it out was to keep building new ships because I can only convert one per turn.
Keith: As a general rule of thumb if the other guy has a red then you had better have one too.
Keith: Then again, as a general rule never move your 3-pointer out of your homeworld system.
gluco: My thoughts were you would sacrifice the r3 and make 3 captures, so building more ships would not help. Was I right?
gluco: Also, I could not sacrifice the g3 'cause then I had no build capability.
Keith: You are right. I overlooked that. I was thinking you build a green I convert a green until there were four greens.

Keith: You are also right about not being able to sacrifice the g3. I think the game would prevent you from even trying.

Keith: I am all for trying another game if you are.
gluco: OK, let's start another one.
