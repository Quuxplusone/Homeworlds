	wil: Very cool... you can't straigten ou the universe but you can play.  It is often best to set up a mock set hat home when it gets compilcated.  Where are you from?  How did you find the game?

	wil: very cool, I used to live near tahoe and visit my sister in SF...
	wil: ah...yes you can only build the color that you already have in your star system (need blue to build a blue)  Hence the reason you have to have a blue and green in your homeworld otherwise you can't build or change
	wil: It takes a while to build when you have to keep changing colors...you had faster games
