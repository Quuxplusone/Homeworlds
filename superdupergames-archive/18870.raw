	Aristos: The Aristos Empire sends greetings to the Shmil1 ambassador. We appreciate the visitations of our neighbors from the north, but it is now time to withdraw your green ships from our homeworld. Failure to do so will be more calamitous for you than for us. We will allow both of your ships to withdraw, if you wish to do so. Failure to withdraw at least one ship in the next standard move will constitute rejection of our generous offer.

	Aristos: We regret to inform you that an accident occurred in our home system. Citizens from both of our empires died in the conflagration. Rest assured we are studying the records to find the cause. Until then, we recommend all ships from other empires stay out of our home system. It is apparently unstable. We may be sending refugees from our world to our neighbors. Please treat them kindly and welcome them into you systems.

	Aristos: Greetings! We mentioned that refugees from our world might come your way. They have arrived. Please make them welcome! You may notice they are heavily armed.
