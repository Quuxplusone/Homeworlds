1) MobyNostromo: H G3 Y2 B3
	wil: This is a great game...takes a while to learn....ask any question Long the way.
	MobyNostromo: Thank you. I'll do my best to make this game interesting for you.

2) wil: H B2 Y1 G3
	wil: Is it your first game?  Do you want me to point out anything?

3) MobyNostromo: B B1 Mobynostromo
	MobyNostromo: Not really my first game because I'm in the process of playing three other ones, but I have yet to finish any. I think I'm getting the general hang of it, so go ahead and destroy me - it might be the best way I learn.

4) wil: B G1 Wil
	wil: It is...watching different attacks come at you is perfect...  I shy away from using G3 as a star...keeps you from getting a factory there.

5) MobyNostromo: T B1 Y1 Mobynostromo
	MobyNostromo: What's a factory?

6) wil: T G1 Y1 Wil
	wil: When you sacrifice a piece you get to use the power of the piece anywhere in the galaxy....when the green bank is empty, and I have a g3 and g1 I can sack my g3 for 3 grows, grow the g3 Right back and still have two more grows for any color anywhere in the galaxy that I have those.colors whether I have a green in that star system or not.

7) MobyNostromo: B Y2 Mobynostromo
	MobyNostromo: Now I understand. I like the idea behind that, like loopholes (or wormholes) in the rules that nurture different strategies. It's definitely something to keep in mind during my next setup.
