	Felix: We have detected aliens out there, so we are retrofitting one of our construction vessels with a warp drive. To do so, we are forced to remove the construction facilities aboard. We hope to explore the surrounding planets soon and see if any of these other life forms are peaceful.
	MagicJohn: Aliens?? Out there?? Where??   No Way!!!  We believe/know that we are the center of the universe and all that dead space "out there" revolves around us.

	sompm: "Sir, the meat has discovered warp drive."
"They WHAT? How do they control their ships?"
"They build pistons and variable resistors  and push them around with meat. Alternatively they use sensitive gold films and electromagnets to record and interpret their meat sounds."
"Oh dear. We told everyone there was nobody here because they wouldn't believe our stories. Are we comfortable with the introduction of meat-based life forms to the galactic community?"
"I'm not sure, sir, but we need to decide quickly or we're going to have an inefficient little Von Neumann meat farm on our hands."

15) Felix: Build Y1 Felix
	MagicJohn:    Com Officer: "Sir Magic, we have indeed intercepted communications from space, and there is some indication that there are multiple alien life forms in our sector. We must somehow protect ourselves from the alien presence and from a populace that may no longer accept our current line of dogmatic "Center of the Universe" BS. We must formulate a plan.."
   S.M.: "Contact Agent Orange."
	Felix: *Squishy meat sounds*
Translation: Sir, detecting the presence of weapons technology in a nearby sector. Suggest developing our own meat missiles to defend ourselves from threat.

16) MagicJohn: Build G1 Magicjohn

17) sompm: Discover B1 Sompm G3 Halc
	MagicJohn: Agent Orange:  "Assemble the council. Advise immediate discontinuation of clandestine population control measures that limit Trog population.... May soon need cannon fodder."

18) dijek: Build G1 Dijek
	sompm: Dateline: an untended base in an empty sector of the outer dark regions. Unregistered materialization that set the network abuzz, conspiracy theories gaining some footing today when a transformation pod made a system-leap, consuming relatively huge amounts of energy to get from one empty, worthless system to another supposedly empty, worthless system. Speculation abounds, some saying that an industry deep-scanner found an unexpected reserve of underground ice or helium atmosphere; aqueous water and resource scans had already ruled the sector out for physical exploration. Might this be good for the local economy, or will foreign exporters exploit the rim worlds again? Stay tuned to 15/3, your source for fourth-arm section-five local news.

	Felix: Good game!
	MagicJohn: Felix,
Sorry about the "spite check" but I had to whack you once before I joined Spock, Scotty and Bones in the great vortex in the sky. Good Game!
	Draw5PlayAll: What vortex? Where is Kirk?
	Draw5PlayAll: And what happened to all the R3s again?
	sompm: Thanks for the game, y'all!
	Felix: John,
Quite understandable. I'd have done the same :)
	Draw5PlayAll: I believe this game was from when Felix said "Never tried a 4P game before. Who's up?" or something in the challenge description.
 
What did you all think of the four-player setup?
	Felix: A bit chaotic, but I enjoyed it. Definitely entertaining, but perhaps less strategic.
	Draw5PlayAll: Well, in the two 4P games I have seen, someone has time forfeited.
	sompm: It felt like it needed a bit more active politics to make a whole lot of sense. Normally in a Homeworlds game I make quite certain to be immune to whatever my opponent could do in a single turn. With three adversaries, so much can change in one round, it's not worth considering every permutation. Also, if the rest of the group wanted you gone, they might very well be able to do so before you had a turn to safeguard against it. With a little more table-talk we might get alliances and betrayals and a little more ability to make "unsafe" moves without worry.
	MagicJohn: I agree with the Sommer. Communication should probably be limited to open comments (written in the game comment window)so all would have opportunities to "negotiate" and propose alternative scenarios. I considered a number of moves in the last game that would have relied on some "help" from the next player but did not feel right about leaving "hints" in the dialogue between plays. I would like to try a more political game. I suspect that anyone that cannot stand a little well-meant betrayal should take a pass but are any of you thick-skinned commanders up for another game?
	Draw5PlayAll: I wish we had a 2v2 mode where opposite seats are partners. You can do this unofficially but it is so easy to break the alliance.
	sompm: Ooh, I would play that. We would have to use house rules, run it as an unrated game so we can declare an alternate victory than SDG will recognize. Not sure if we would want to do SW/NE or NS/WE to allow or prevent teams getting two turns in a row.
	Draw5PlayAll: I said "opposite seats", implying that teams will not get two turns in a row.
 
MagicJohn proposed a challenge for 4P which I entered, but I am not 100% sure about what he means by "politics". I do not want to debate about You-Know-Who and You-Know-As-Well.
 
We could even custom-implement Good/Evil rules as long as a fifth person monitors the game.
 
Partners should choose identical homeworld configurations (e.g. both goldilocks, both banker, etc). This is so they can send resources to each other more easily.
 
Main problem is that players 1 and 3 can gang up on player 4, and then after 4 dies, 2 is an easy target. Though maybe 2 could send extra resources and cause some catastrophes, so it evens out.
 
But it becomes nearly impossible to do the factory since you have TWO opponents who could each sac a Y2 and send a G1 to blow up the overpopulation.
	MagicJohn: Maybe the "rules" could be altered to forestall immediate attacks on #4.  Maybe no invasions for X number of turns...
	Draw5PlayAll: P4 can simply not connect his homeworld to the opposition and then get help from 2 in stopping the attack.
 
1,4 vs 2,3 seems fairer in this regard but then you have a team making 2 consecutive turns.
	MagicJohn: But after the first move both teams would move in consecutive turns..... might work?....
	Draw5PlayAll: So to recap:
1,3 vs 2,4.
Advantages: team members do not get to make 2 consecutive turns.
Disadvantages: player 4 is an easy target for attack.
1,4 vs 2,3.
Advantages: Balances number of turns.
Disadvantages: after the first move, teams get 2 turns in a row.
 
Honestly, I think we should have a vote. I vote for 1,3 vs 2,4.
