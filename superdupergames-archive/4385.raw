zoltar: The other major rule is that you need to build a red ship as soon as your opponent does. Note that if you had even a lowly R1 in any of your systems, you could now simply sacrifice the R1 and capture my B3. But I'm now threatening to sacrifice my R1 and capture your Y3.

30) zoltar: Sacrifice R1 Greendale
Attack Y3 Lamp

31) mjbuyck: Move Y1 Lamp Mjbuyck
mjbuyck: aaah... I totally forgot about the sacrifice rule again. That takes some getting used to, the idea that you can sacrifice one ship to have another one do something on the other side of the solar system/galaxy.

32) zoltar: Build G2 Zoltar

33) mjbuyck: Trade G1 R1 Mjbuyck

34) zoltar: Build Y2 Lamp
zoltar: Yes, it takes several games to get a feel for sacrifices. Think of it as giving the power of the color of the sacrificed piece to any star in the system where you have a ship, so you can act as if that star were of the sacrificed color. The hardest part is the multiple sacrifice rule, such as sacking a Y3 to move a piece three times, all the way from my homeworld to yours.
mjbuyck: which I do realize that I just avoided, thank you.

35) mjbuyck: Move Y1 Mjbuyck Panda
zoltar: Now normally here I would instinctively trade a ship somewhere for a red ship to balance yours. I instead decided to rapidly build yellow ships for several reasons: I have more large ships; you don't have large yellow ships to threaten to move pieces to attack me; the red star gives me defence of a red ship in my homeworld (red stars are an advantage in the middle game because of this but a disadvantage in the opening, where red isn't used); and I can secure a lasting advantage if I control most of the yellow technology.
mjbuyck: And I can't store yellow because I you'll just blow me up, nice.
mjbuyck: I've probably hurt myself too much by trying to keep the b1 pieces away from you. :P

36) zoltar: Sacrifice G2 Zoltar
Build Y3 Greendale
Build Y3 Lamp

37) mjbuyck: Build R1 Mjbuyck
zoltar: Note that I couldn't get away with this trick if you had a Y2 somewhere (you would sacrifice the Y2 to move your Y1 twice and cause a catastrophe in Lamp, destroying both my Y3 ships).

38) zoltar: Move Y3 Greendale Panda

39) mjbuyck: Move Y1 Panda Greendale

40) zoltar: Trade Y2 R2 Lamp
zoltar: Oops, I typed that in wrong.
zoltar: Btw, a beginners mistake would have been to sacrifice my Y3 at greendale to move the Y3,Y3, and Y2 from Lamp to your homeworld and cause a catastrophe. While it would blow up one of your stars, it would liquidate my entire yellow fleet, and I would have only a slight advantage; whereas if I keep most of the yellows, I have a much larger advantage with all the added mobility and the threats of sacrificing.

41) mjbuyck: Build Y2 Greendale

Attack Y2 Greendale
Attack Y1 Greendale

mjbuyck: hmm... just kill me?

45) mjbuyck: Trade B1 G1 Baxter

46) zoltar: Build G2 Zoltar
zoltar: my best option is to simply use my advantage to get the rest of the large pieces before you can, and then attack, as you can't stop my buildup.
