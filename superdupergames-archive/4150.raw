zoltar: Hello again! I was hoping to play you again soon. As you see, my rating is inflated from beating up on beginners. Though I finally won a game (for the first time ever) with world champion Andy Looney in person last week. Whew who! Though I had the advantage you have in this game: I went first and played "the banker" setup. Which means I'll have an uphill battle the whole game here.

20) zoltar: Trade Y1 R1 Zoltar

21) TwoShort: Trade G2 R2 Twoshort

22) zoltar: Move R1 Zoltar Yellowstone
TwoShort: I've lost 4 out of 4 against Andy in person, despite beating him 3 out of 3 online. He's got the "banker" set up nicely in our current game though. I've started from this homwworld before, but this is my first experiment with the early trade of my capital ship to lock up the y3s.

zoltar: Aha -- the factory. That gives you 4 battlestars to my one. Well, I think I blew this game. Glad to be reminded I'm still a beginner! We should play more, TwoShort. I'm going to take on Andy again tomorrow night, but I think it will be another dozen games before I beat him again...
zoltar: The 'investment' part of the banker setup seems to be a crucial middle game strategy. My position is already lost.
TwoShort: And here I was thinking you had more abiltiy to move your shipd around, and were in a better position to get the big reds. Call them like you see them I guess, but it didn't feel over to me...
