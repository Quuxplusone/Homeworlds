	Jesse: Okay, read the strategy tips on the wiki, if you haven't already.  It's not my intention to give tips during the course of this game, but rather to handicap it by passing my first few turns after setting up my homeworld.  I have no idea how many passes is appropriate for any given skill difference, so why don't we try 3?

	twopercentright: why can't i discover a new star from a Grainne?

32) Jesse: Discover G2 Jesse Y2 Draal
	Jesse: I can't answer that question without knowing what command you were trying to enter.  One possibility is that you were trying to discover a small system, but you can only move to medium and large systems from Grainne.  Another possibility is that you were trying to discover a g2 system, but there isn't a g2 marker available.  Or, it might have just been a syntax error.
