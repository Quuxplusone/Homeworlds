Winner: Trydnt

1) Trydnt: Homeworld B3 G1 R3
	Trydnt: have you played before?

2) fogus: Homeworld B2 R1 G3
	Trydnt: I'd recommend "homeworld b2 r1 g3" as your starter. it's a good one for beginners.

3) Trydnt: Build R1 Trydnt
	fogus: I have played, but it's both been a while and I was also quite confused. :)

4) fogus: Build G1 Fogus
	Trydnt: So you essentially need blue and green in the three pieces you start with (2 stars and a ship). This will allow you to grow and then trade for other colors so you don't get locked out of any color. if your opponent starts building the bigger ships of a certain color and you don't have any you will struggle to catch up before they get a pretty big material advantage. It's all about keeping a diverse collection of ships and spreading them in a way you can defend while you keep growing. there are things to watch out for like having too many of a color in one place or building the last of a certain size ship that might open up a larger one for your opponent to grow

5) Trydnt: Trade R1 Y1 Trydnt

6) fogus: Build G1 Fogus

7) Trydnt: Build R1 Trydnt
	fogus: So one thing that I've found quite confusing is the tactic of shutting people out of certain colors. Therefore, my move is an attempt to try out that path. :)

8) fogus: Trade G1 Y1 Fogus
	Trydnt: yes it's generally good if you can lock your opponent out of a color but it is slightly less effective with green if you opponent moves to green stars

9) Trydnt: Trade R1 G1 Trydnt

10) fogus: Build G2 Fogus

11) Trydnt: Build G2 Trydnt

12) fogus: Discover Y1 Fogus G3 Foo
	fogus: Is there a general rule of thumb around achieving the first 2-pip piece? Instinctively it seems like a good thing, but I'm unsure about the deeper implications.

13) Trydnt: Discover G2 Trydnt B2 B2

14) fogus: Trade G3 Y3 Fogus

15) Trydnt: Build R1 Trydnt
	Draw5PlayAll: Do not get the first 2 if your opponent gets the first 3...
	Trydnt: yeah bigger pieces are better but always be warry of taking the last piece of a certain size when there are larger pieces behind it that you'll open up for your opponent

16) fogus: Trade G1 B1 Fogus

17) Trydnt: Build R1 Trydnt

18) fogus: Build B1 Fogus
	fogus: That last move felt like a flail on my part. I can't see a way to progress my piece count, but at the same time I want to diversify if possible.

19) Trydnt: Move R1 Trydnt B2
