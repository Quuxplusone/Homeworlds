	Keith: This has been an excellent struggle.  Sorry but I must head off to a nine hour workshift.

42) zoltar: Trade R3 Y3 Zoltar
	zoltar: Ok, maybe we can continue late tonight -- I think I'm losing.  I can at least force the supernova of one of your stars, but it has been at considerable cost.  Whether or not that can compensate for your lead in development we'll soon see.
	Keith: I have a development lead but so far I am not on offense.  All my ships are at least two away from your homeworld and my ship colors are not much of a catastrophe threat to your homeworld stars.

43) Keith: Sacrifice G2 Balderdash
Build R1 Zoltar
Build R2 Zoltar
Catastrophe Zoltar Red
	Keith: I think I can make it difficult for you to get that fourth yellow at my homeworld.

44) zoltar: Build G1 Betazed
	Keith: Or maybe not.  An expensive catastrophe indeed.  A y2, y1, y1, and g1 of yours.  Though I did waste a turn converting your y1.

45) Keith: Move Y3 Midworld Zoltar

	zoltar: Oh you're right, I meant to change my Y3 back to red, but I spaced out.  Good game.  Play again?
	Keith: Yes we should play again.  If you had changed your Y3 back to a R3 then I could have moved my R1 in an catastrophied all the ships at your homeworld.
