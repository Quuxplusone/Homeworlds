2) Jesse: Homeworld B1 Y3 G3
	AnalogKid: Hi!
 
This is my first time playing on SDG (and my first Homeworlds game) so I am just learning how all of this works.  :)
	Jesse: Hello.  Welcome to SDG, and I hope you enjoy Homeworlds.  It can be a difficult game to wrap your head around at first, so feel free to ask about anything that comes up.

3) AnalogKid: Build G1 Analogkid
	AnalogKid: Thanks.  I've been reading up on Homeworlds so I hope that I won't have too many questions about how to play. (Playing well is different issue ^_^ )

16) Jesse: Trade B3 Y3 Pollux

17) AnalogKid: Move B2 Analogkid Aldebaran
	Jesse: I think you'll find that giving up your green there will make things difficult in the upcoming turns.  It's usually better to diversify when you have the chance.

18) Jesse: Build B3 Pollux

19) AnalogKid: Build G1 Aldebaran
	AnalogKid: I am in central Ohio and we are without electricity now and my laptop battery is almost gone so I will not be able to play for a few days ...
	Jesse: I am also in central Ohio.  I hope your power is restored soon, if it is not already.
	AnalogKid: Hello, I'm back now.  Sorry for the one week delay.  Power was out until Saturday and it then took a couple of days for things to return to normal.

20) Jesse: Trade B3 Y3 Pollux
	AnalogKid: I see a little better now what you meant about giving up my green in my home system.  I was a little focused on issues of blue though ...
	Jesse: Yeah, blue was awkward for you, which is why I rushed it.  You did the right thing, getting in.  You don't necessarily need a lot of blue to stop me from abusing it, so you would probably have been better off trading your B3 back to yellow, rather than your green.  Another possibility would be building another green first, and trading that one.  I'd lean towards trading the B3, though, since you don't want to keep it blue in the long term anyway.
	Jesse: t b3 y3 pollux
	Jesse: Grr.  I hate when I do that.  XD

21) AnalogKid: Move Y1 Analogkid Aldebaran

22) Jesse: Discover B2 Pollux G3 Markab

23) AnalogKid: Trade B3 G3 Analogkid
	Jesse: Do you see the immediate threat I'm making?
	AnalogKid: No -- I'm not sure that I see any "immediate threat" but I can foresee a few possible problems 3-4 turns from now ...

24) Jesse: Build B3 Pollux
	Jesse: That was a good move, because I was threatening to destroy your large ship and half your home system.  With a Y3 sacrifice, I could make three moves: Move my B1 from Pollux to Markab, then move the B1 and B2 from Markab to your home system.  That would have left four blue pieces there, so I could call a catastrophe to send them all back to the global reserve.

25) AnalogKid: Discover B2 Aldebaran G2 Altair
	AnalogKid: Well, that was lucky then because I thought it would take at least two turns for you to do that :)  And it would have ended the game unless I had moved another ship home.  I had no idea that you could move the same ship more than once in a turn -- it had never occurred to me.

26) Jesse: Build B3 Markab

27) AnalogKid: Move Y1 Aldebaran Pollux
	Jesse: It's an easy thing for a beginner to overlook or not realize, which is why I'm pointing it out.
	AnalogKid: Thanks :)

28) Jesse: Trade Y3 R3 Pollux

29) AnalogKid: Build Y1 Pollux

Attack B2 Altair
Attack Y1 Markab

37) AnalogKid: Move Y1 Markab Analogkid
	Jesse: Sending in your little yellows to try to blow up my Y3 was a nice idea, but it didn't have much chance of working, and it left them vulnerable to capture when I got some red ships.  On the other hand, with your material disadvantage pretty much any course available to you is unlikely to help much.
	AnalogKid: Hello - sorry for the long delay!  BGF is now over so I should have more time now to play on SDG.
	AnalogKid: Well, I did not necessarily think that I would be successful but I was trying to disrupt a perceived threat.  Of course, I did not think my efforts would end in my being completely shut out of blue!  (BTW, I had a chance to play Homeworlds last night with another local player at BGF).

38) Jesse: Sacrifice Y3 Altair
Move B3 Pollux Markab
Move B3 Markab Analogkid
Move B3 Markab Analogkid
	Jesse: Cool.  How'd it go?

39) AnalogKid: Attack B3S Analogkid
	AnalogKid: Well, I lost half of my homeworld very early in the game, but then both my opponent and I floundered around for awhile, uncertain of what to do.  Finally, I saw an opening, got lucky, and managed to destroy the only ship in the opposing homeworld.

40) Jesse: Sacrifice R2 Markab
Attack G3 Analogkid

	Jesse: Yeah, in the middle game it can be difficult for beginning players to figure out what they need to be doing.
