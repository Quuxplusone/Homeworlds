32) ts52: Build R2 Grover
	wil: It is funny, when I see that a move has been made in an HW game....  I never expect that it is this one that needs attention...  It is a completely different game though...  Cutthroat is right...  somewhere along the line, you gotta cut someone out...without making yourself vulnerable.

33) wil: Discover Y2 R1 B2 B2
	TeeTeeTee: Yeah, this game can be quite unforgiving at times. A few turns back, I was very tempted to build a y3 instead of trading for an r1, thinking that I could get away without a red ship for another turn. I noticed just in time, though, that I would have been knocked out immediately if I'd done that.
 
There's another element in the three-player game that isn't there in the two player-game: if it's in the players' interests (or at least they think it is), then they can work together to knock someone else out, as they have two attacking turns to the defender's one turn. Everyone has to guess: would they? (And wil: is it worth an r2 to find out? :P)

34) TeeTeeTee: Move R1 Teeteetee B1
	wil: exactamentary.....  and funny enough this is the fastest moving game I am currently in!

35) ts52: Discover R3 Grover Y3 Zoe

36) wil: Build G1 Wil
	TeeTeeTee: ts52: wil is going to sacrifice his g3 to build three yellow ships on the next turn. If you want to stop him having more large ships than you (and me), then you need to block off a large yellow, either by trading your r3 for a y3, or by discovering a y3 star.
	wil: Captain, received a transmission on SETI, evidently someone thinks we would risk losing our current fuel reserves by reducing our ability to build and simultaneously increasing our refining capacity....  our scientists looked at this and determined it wasn't worth the risk of a potential well site catastrophe which would destroy all reserves and exploration in one or more systems...  first contact and what are they thinking?

37) TeeTeeTee: Discover Y3 Bigbird B3 G3
	ts52: Ok Tee, you convinced me. Here's hoping I don't regret it.
	TeeTeeTee: Good call. If I was wil, I'd have definitely sacrificed the g3.

	TeeTeeTee: If I were you, wil, I would have sacrificed the g2 to build a y3 on your last move.
	wil: And that is why you are top dog!!  Thanx I missed that.  I don't take enough time on moves.
	wil: I was concentrating on slyly causing the eliminating of all the small ships and securing my fortress...

61) wil: Sacrifice R1 Wil
Attack R3E Grover
	TeeTeeTee: Damnit, ts52- just when things were about to get interesting...
	ts52: oh crap. sorry guys... things got hectic here and I lost track
	ts52: can we try again without hard time?
	ts52: looks like you can only specify one person to challenge. wil, if you join up, we can try again.
	TeeTeeTee: I'm sorry, but I won't play without hard time... perhaps we can try another three-player game later on, when things are less hectic.
	ts52: Ok, that's fair.
	wil: Dang it!  My record holds... can't complete a multi person game.

66) TeeTeeTee: Move R1 Teeteetee G3
	wil: I knew I shouldn't have sacked that single pip...  my fortress was strong....

	wil: well that is that.... I think I still way prefer the binary game...
	TeeTeeTee: Yes, I prefer binary too, but I did enjoy this game: Ternary Homeworlds plays very differently to binary. There's a much greater degree of guessing each players' intentions and working out whether it's in players' interests to collude or not. There were instances in that game when two players could have caused serious damage to a third, if they could work together - but there was no guarantee that the player you were working with would do what you expected... 
 
Also, nobody wanted to start attacking because the third player would continue to acquire ships while the other two were sparring. (For my part, I noticed that by sacrificing and discovering a y1 world, I could be in a position to attack your homeworld - but doing this would quite likely have put ts52 at an advantage. I couldn't see any obvious way to attack ts52's homeworld.)
 
It was surprising just how quickly the game changed once ts52 timed out, though. Once ts52 was out, there were lots of free large ships to claim, and no reason to not attack... 
	wil: There is another method where you can only attack to the left...keeps folks from ganging up...hmmm I wonder if it also allows one to use the stars to the right...interesting...
