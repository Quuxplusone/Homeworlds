29) Babamots: Discover G1 Kurl Y2 Iconia
	Babamots: So if you name several systems of the same color, do you pick other muppets? I can only think of a few muppets of each color. Are there any green ones besides Kermit and Oscar?
	ts52: Typically I don't have too many. For green I typically have kermit, oscar and robin (kermit's nephew). For red I use elmo, but if I get more than that I have to scramble a bit. For blue I have gonzo and grover. And yellow is bigbird, and if I squint zoe.

30) ts52: Discover G2 Gonzo Y3 Bigbird
	Babamots: I also thought of Little Bird and Bert. Telly is kind of red.
	Babamots: Pepe and Animal are pretty red. Cookie Monster, Harry Monster, and Sam Eagle are blue. Scooter and Janice are yellowish. Dr. Teeth and Sherlock Hemlock have green skin.
	ts52: Excellent! I've used Scooter before, but Animal is a good one, as in Dr. Teeth. Thanks!

Kurl
 
Betazed seems to be a blue or green. Galorndon seems to be always blue.
	Babamots: Not on purpose. I pick Star Trek worlds for my system names almost totally at random.
	Babamots: Sometimes "Ferenginar" is an investment, or "Kronos" might be for an aggressive move. 
	Babamots: Sometimes "Ferenginar" is an investment, or "Kronos" might be for an aggressive move.

	Draw5PlayAll: But what are Xindus & Kurl & Cuellar?
Heck, maybe you should just give me a full list of your system names and their meanings, without any spoilers.
	Babamots: Here are the names I use most often:
Iconia: Home of an ancient race that built mysterious gateways allowing instant travel between distant worlds.
Romulus: Home of the manipulative, secretive Romulans. 
Galorndon: Site of a tense standoff between the Federation and the Romulans.
Kronos: Home of the Klingon warrior race.
Betazed: Home of a telepathic race including TNG's Troi.
Cuellar: Site of a secret Cardassian fleet in defiance of their treaty with the Federation.
Kurl: Home of an extremely ancient, long-extinct race. Captain Picard was given a rare artifact from Kurl by his archeology mentor.
Xindus: A planet shown in ENT that's home to 5 intelligent lifeforms.
Vulcan: Home of a highly intelligent, logic-loving race that is friendly to the Federation.
Ferenginar: Home of the greedy, scheming, big-eared Ferengi.

	Babamots: I'm having a hard time NOT thinking about this game, but I also need to focus on other things for today. I'm hoping that posting this note will give me enough closure of thought that I can get some work done :-).

73) Babamots: Sacrifice R2 Babamots
Attack R1S Ts52
Attack Y2S Ts52
	Babamots: Two by two, ships of blue :-).
	ts52: :) Well played. I was too focused on the attack by catastrophe to notice the threat of just attack. Something I have to learn to look for.

74) ts52: Build G2 Ts52

75) Babamots: Attack G2S Ts52
	Babamots: (Red alert)
	Babamots: I prefer winning by hostile takeover rather than by system marker catastrophe. It takes fewer ships, and it does seem to me that people are less likely to see it coming.

76) ts52: Build G2 Ts52
	ts52: Indeed. I think at this point I can only delay the inevitable.
	Babamots: You can make it another last another three moves, I think.

77) Babamots: Build G3 Ts52
Catastrophe Ts52 G
	Babamots: (red alert)
	Babamots: I probably don't need to tell you "red alert" when a passing move from you would be an immediate loss :-).

	ts52: Not my best move, now that I think about it more, but taking your r1 only buys me one or two more turns, and you're not going to make a big enough mistake for me to capitalize. Good game.
	Babamots: Good game! I'll record it for the tournament.
	ts52: Thanks!
