2) mneme: Homeworld G3 B1 Y3
	TwoShort: Howdy.
	mneme: Hey!  I figure my butt needs some more kicking, after a several-seson gap.  Has anyone won that ultra-small challenge?

3) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort
	TwoShort: Not so far...

4) mneme: Build Y1 Mneme

5) TwoShort: Trade G1 Y1 Twoshort

9) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

10) mneme: Discover B1 Mneme B2 Azure
	TwoShort: Trying to turn my favorite blue freeze-out tactic against me eh?
	mneme: Might as well. (actially, I used it before it was used against me, so...)

11) TwoShort: Discover G1 Twoshort B3 Bluonia

12) mneme: Build B2 Mneme
	TwoShort: I just mean I've been playing it a lot lately; It's a great tactic, and I'm annoyed I let you get it started.  I guess I get to test my latest theory on how to respond...
	mneme: we'll see how it works -- I'm playing against it in another game, so I'm curious as to how your response will work.

13) TwoShort: Discover G1 Twoshort B3 Bluotron

14) mneme: Discover B2 Mneme G2 John
	mneme: I was wondering if you'd do that.

15) TwoShort: Discover Y1 Twoshort B3 Bluzilla
	TwoShort: Well, this wasn't actually my plan, but it looks too fun to resist :)

16) mneme: Trade B2 R2 John
	mneme: Heh.  No way I could have predicted that. :)
 
I should have moved to green before building -- that would have been, well, smarter.  :)

17) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

18) mneme: Build Y1 Mneme
	mneme: and this...is where it gets ugly.  Ah well

26) mneme: Build B2 Mneme
	TwoShort: Dangit; I was hoping you'd do what you did first :)

27) TwoShort: Trade G1 Y1 Bluonia
	mneme: heh.  Yeah.  That one lets you get away with a cheap solution, if one that doesn't cost me as much either.  Despite the insane amount by which I'm losing...one of my choices lets me get into blue freeze mode again, and is therefore clearly superior.

28) mneme: Discover B2 Mneme G2 Emerald

29) TwoShort: Move G3 Bluonia Emerald

31) TwoShort: Sacrifice R2 Bluonia

48) mneme: Sacrifice G3 Mneme
Build B2 Forest
Build Y2 Forest
Build G1 Azure

49) TwoShort: Build B3 Mneme
	TwoShort: Hmmm... I'm always suspicious of the plan that jumps into my head before coffee in the morning :) but I don't see why it won't work...

50) mneme: Attack B3 Mneme

51) TwoShort: Build B3 Mneme
	mneme: we'll see.  it certainly forces the green sac (or I lose green in my home system, which is...ungood).  I don't see a checkmate here, but I may be missing something.
	TwoShort: I didn't see a checkmate either; I just thought I was forcing you to lose green :)  I hadn't really considered the green sac... so we'll see...

52) mneme: Attack Y2 Mneme
Catastrophe Mneme B
	TwoShort: DO NOT BLUEBIRD!
	TwoShort: Oops, that was supposed to go in the notebook. :) I guess I've given away my cunning plan to avoid screwing up.
	mneme: hmm.  Now I need to figure out wtf that means...

53) TwoShort: Trade Y3 G3 Twoshort
	TwoShort: It means I need to be sure I don't let you get to where you can throw two yellows into my homeworld and win.  I picked up this name for such a blunder from Andy Looney, who named it after an Amsterdam cofeehouse he once made it in, as detailed in his YouTube video "The Bluebird Mistake".

54) mneme: Sacrifice Y2 Mneme
Move Y2 Forest Bluonia
Move Y2 Forest Bluonia
Catastrophe Bluonia Y
	mneme: Ah.  I was kinda hoping you'd let me get two yellows into your homeworld and win. :)

55) TwoShort: Build G2 Twoshort
	TwoShort: Between the blue catastrophe suddenly putting your homeworld next to mine, and me getting all over-eager to finish you off, it's exactly where I might have screwed that up...

56) mneme: Sacrifice B1 Forest
Trade G1 B1 Mneme
	mneme: *nod*.  I was keeping it (and the threat forcing you to take non-growing action) in mind.  I didn't expect you to fall for it, but it was worth a try. :)

57) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

58) mneme: Build B1 Mneme
	mneme: *@*#@.  The system should force you to pass if you don't cause a catastrophe and one is available, just like it forces you to pass to avoid other optional moves.  Is that why you didn't catastrophe my home system, or did you decide that if I didn't, it was a win for you anyway?
	TwoShort: I agree it should force you to explicitly pass.  In my case, I intentionally skipped it because I figured you had to trigger it or waste a move capturing my B3 if you really wanted to force me to trigger it.  By making you do it, the pieces aren't in the stash and your homeworlds adjacency doesn't change until the end of your turn.  I don't know that it made any difference in this case, but I just habitually try to inflict whatever inconveniences I can :)

59) TwoShort: Move G1 Twoshort Mneme

60) mneme: Attack G1 Mneme

61) TwoShort: Move G2 Twoshort Mneme

	TwoShort: Yeah, I'm afraid so.  Excellent game though, thanks!
