Catastrophe Grissom Green
	Grissom: Absolutely! I have a good amount of time between now and the end of May.
	hellajoey: Cool. If I remember correctly you have children and you live in Gresham. I live in SE. So maybe a happy hour thing near me on your way home would work well? Seems like you could stop by on your way home sometime? If that's not as good a weekend afternoon also works.
	hellajoey: I should warn you a full game could take us a couple hours.
	hellajoey: Something I've been thinking of trying but haven't is playing with a chess clock. We could try that for limiting game time.
