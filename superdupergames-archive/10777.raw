	dsheldon: I'm not sure it will help you much this time, but you need to be much more aggresive.  Since the beginning of the game you've overdeveloped near your homeworld.  So far you've brought one medium ship within a jump of my homeworld while I frequently have had several larges threatening yours.  I put some notes on the Icehousegames wiki about this last week:
 
http://www.icehousegames.org/wiki/index.php?title=Homeworlds_strategy#The_Early_Game_-__Building_Up
 
We're past the opening, but it's still something to think about.  For reference, the simple rubric here gives you a score of 11 to my 21, which doesn't even give an accounting of your unfavorable color distribution.
 
I hope this doesn't come across as grandstanding and is taken as the constructive advice it is intended to be.
	nycavri: No problem, d.  I know I can use the help!
 
I've found when I'm agressive, I lose quickly.  Of course, when I'm defensive, I still end up losing, but less quickly!
 
I was concentrating on stalling you with my green catastrophe gambit, but since it has looked to me that I was always one move away from losing a home star, and have played the only move I could see which defended against this.
 
I have to go back and see if there was somewhere where I could have been more agressive, but if memory serves, this would only have been possible if you missed an obvious opening . . .
 
 
I continue to either get greamed by experts, or beat rookies on silly mistakes.  Neither is especially satisfying.  I really would like to play Homeworlds with someone at my own level . . .
	nycavri: I think the pace of play also hurts me here, where it doesn't on other SDG games.
 
I have a pretty good idea of my/your next few moves once I look over the board but, even with the notes, I often miss something when I come bac for my move sometimes days later . . .

	dsheldon: Maybe you would have an easier time if you don't have so many active games.  Our game is he only one I'm in right now.  It makes it pretty easy to concentrate, even with several days between moves.
 
I would be overjoyed if I could ever play against you face to face.
 
Have you tried looking for SDG players with a similar ranking?  The interface to do that is pretty clunky, but I'm pretty sure it's possible.
	nycavri: It's true, I do prefer a certain type of game here - one where I can see the whole situation in one look.  Penguin Soccer is like that, and Blam!  Also games like Photonic Attack and Diagonals.
 
Where are you based?  I'm in New York.  My full time job in Summer Camping means I don't get to do any of the big f2f cons (althought I did get to NonCon this year, which was great).
 
The problem with the ranking system is that to get a score as low as mine, you have to have an awful lot of games under your belt.  Most people quit on a game long before their score gets into the 1400s . . .

	dsheldon: I'm in Pittsburgh, I also never get out to cons and, with a baby on the way in September, it's not something I expect to be able to do for a while.  But my sister lives in New York City and it's not impossible that I would find my way out there sometime.
	nycavri: Congrats on your "package in the mail"!  My wife goes off the pill this summer . . .
