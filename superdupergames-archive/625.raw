1) jeep: Homeworld B3 G1 Y3

2) jesse: Homeworld Y2 B1 G3
jeep: Hello! Well, I figure I'll try this out. I'm currently (and temporarily) in China, with sporadic access to the internet, but I should be able to move every other day, at least. Multiple moves per day, when I make them, if you are online too. ;)

3) jeep: Build Y1 Jeep
jesse: Hello. It's no problem if you can't move very often. It's nice if you can, of course, but definitely more important that you make the most of your time in China. What are you there for, by the way?

4) jesse: Build G1 Jesse
jeep: I'm working. 10-16 hour days. Bleh.

5) jeep: Discover Y1 Jeep Y2 Trav

6) jesse: Discover G1 Jesse B3 Ungo
jeep: Terrible sorry! My laptop died. I'm on a loaner right now. I should have decent access except for the day I will be flying.

7) jeep: Trade Y3 G3 Jeep
jesse: It's okay. Adverse conditions do come up now and then.

8) jesse: Build G1 Jesse
jeep: They've been coming up way too often in my life lately. ;) Heck, I couldn't even type "Terribly" correctly in my last message though. I've been in China too long.
jesse: Huh. I thought you were going to try to freeze me out of yellow.

9) jeep: Move Y1 Trav Jeep
jeep: Yeah, I skipped a step in my plan. ;) I'm not very good at this game yet. heh.

10) jesse: Build G2 Ungo
jeep: Bleh, I have too much time to forget what I'm doing and what I have already done.

11) jeep: Build Y1 Jeep

12) Jesse: Trade G2 Y2 Ungo

13) jeep: Discover Y1 Jeep B2 Tradago

14) Jesse: Build G2 Jesse
jeep: If this is too painfully slow, let me know and I'll resign (or force me to). I'm home now and slowly recovering and catching up. I would expect that I will soon be playing at a "normal" pace, but it might take me a while to get there.
Jesse: I don't mind the wait now and then, although it would be great if you could get back to a normal pace.

jeep: I feel like I should just concede to get to the next game. I learned a lot, but this is only my first game, except one against another complete newbie and we were trying to figure the rules out...

26) Jesse: Sacrifice G3 Jesse
Build G3 Jesse
Build G3 Sol
Build R1 Jesse
Jesse: You have played well, considering that. It does look like an appropriate place to concede, if you wish. However, I would also be happy to play to the end if you prefer. Either way, thanks for the game, and I look forward to playing another sometime.

jeep: I'll play again, if you want. I learned quite a bit in just one game. I'm sure I'll learn more in the next. Is there a challenge feature?
