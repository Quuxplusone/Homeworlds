Homeworlds Online (SDG# 29809)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2016.6.1, Ended: 2016.7.6
Participants: Felix (S), AcetyleneLamp (N)
Winner: Felix

1) AcetyleneLamp: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3
	AcetyleneLamp: I can't get the names of the systems to show up.

2) Felix: Homeworld B3 Y2 G3
	AcetyleneLamp: Nevermind
	Felix: It takes some figuring out. The language for submitting orders is a bit finicky, but just play around and you'll get it. Is this your first game? Hope you have fun and let me know if you have questions!

3) AcetyleneLamp: Build G1 Acetylenelamp
	AcetyleneLamp: I attempted to play this before and asked for some help in figuring it out and I had to just give up because I never got a reply (The one time I attempted to play Zendo went similarly as well). I decided to give this another chance after watching the video about how to play Homeworlds that Looney Labs put on YouTube and that cleared up things a little.

4) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	AcetyleneLamp: I'm hoping the new version of SDG that's in the works will have a less fiddly/confusing input system for games, I think that would improve this site a lot.
	Felix: I hope so too! And sorry you never got a response before. I'm happy to help you figure the game out, since it's really a great game! You're off to a great start with your choice of piece sizes and colors. In my opinion, the homeworld colors/sizes and the large green ship you have are the best starting combination.
	Felix: When you're entering orders, it helps to abbreviate the words. Rather than saying "built g1 felix" I just type "b g1 felix" and the system will take that. Each command can be shortened to its first letter like that. The names of systems must be typed out fully though.

36) Felix: Build Y1 Rygar
	Felix: Oopsie. Watch out for that overpopulation threat!
	AcetyleneLamp: I'm confused as to how that happened, I thought it had to be four or more pieces of the same color in one system for a catastrophe.
	AcetyleneLamp: Oh, wait, you moved a blue ship in and caused it.

37) AcetyleneLamp: Build G2 Giedi_prime
	Felix: Yeah. Any time you build three ships of the same color in a system, you should make sure that there's no way your opponent can get a fourth ship in there to cause a catastrophe.
