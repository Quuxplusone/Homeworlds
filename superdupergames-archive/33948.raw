	Broccoli_Commander: I'd say the game can really go either way. It's funny because it's possible to counter my yellow freeze out by getting a y3 yourself and I thought I would get a bigger lead since you did not... but in the end I'm pretty impressed by the position you are in. You are ahead in several aspects. Interesting!
