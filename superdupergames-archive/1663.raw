	illvilja: Oops...  this is the message window, not the order window :-).

3) JunkMan: Homeworld G1 B3 Y3
	illvilja: Cool... that were better!  Ok, ok, Lexicon... I'm a copycat.
	Lexicon: Well, we'll just need to refrain from destroying each other.  Now where's that bennyb at?  Too many new players jumping on, starting games, and not following through.
	illvilja: Well, patience is a virtue... but I slowly realize that there might be a point with the "Force surrender" button.
	illvilja: That is a problem with game servers where anonymous ppl "too easily" can sign up for a game. As the sign up phase don't require "enough effort" it does not weed out all the ppl who are quite inactive.  Not that I would sort bennyb into that cathegory, he might have other reasons for not doing his move.
 
Oh, BTW, Junkman... are you there?  Just pinging...

	Lexicon: He hasn't been on in 2.5 weeks.  Unless y'all want to wait longer, I'm going to resign him tomorrow.
	JunkMan: I'm here, I didn't even remember that I was in this game, it's been so long.  I'm all for giving people time, but being gone for the better part of a month is too long.  I vote for resigning him if he doesn't move today.

4) Lexicon: Build Y1 Lexicon

	Lexicon: Fine by me.
