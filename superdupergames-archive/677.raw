Attack R1N Matrixfrog

39) MatrixFrog: Trade G2 R2 Matrixfrog
MatrixFrog: I realize that what I'm about to do kind of sucks, but I can't see anything better at the current moment.
MatrixFrog: Wait. Nevermind. Hold on.
MatrixFrog: Okay, I think I got it.
MatrixFrog: No I don't. I suppose you've won.

40) Jesse: Sacrifice R2 Jesse
Attack R2N Matrixfrog
Attack Y1N Matrixfrog
Jesse: Right, you're pretty well defenseless at this point. This kind of move is why I built an extra r2 before launching the attack.
Jesse: Imagine how much more preparation I would have needed if you still had a large ship at home.
Jesse: Thanks for the game!
