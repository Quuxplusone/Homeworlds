ts52: This is very curious. I'm sure I'm going to lose, but I'm not sure how.... And I know I don't want to do anything. Not sure if it's really legal to pass, but SDG seems to accept it.
jeep: I think passing is actually legal. If nothing else, you could do a "no op" type move like: s g1 cookiemonster; b g1 cookiemonster

43) jeep: Move Y1 Thumb Jeep
ts52: Right, that makes sense.

44) ts52: Pass

45) jeep: Move B3 Jeep Movement

46) ts52: Pass
ts52: This is tough. With no transportation, I'm left to wait and watch you make your move...
jeep: Nod, I'm about to make a move that would take several moves to undo if I later decide it's wrong, so I'm going to think about this for a little bit and not make the move at midnight. ;)
jeep: Okay, here's a move I can undo if needed and I know I want to make it. ;)

47) jeep: Move B3 Jeep Movement

48) ts52: Pass

49) jeep: Move Y1 Jeep Thumb

50) ts52: Pass

51) jeep: Move G2 Thumb Cache2
jeep: *sigh* changed plans and had to undo a move I made earlier. :(
ts52: I'm still curious to see how you're going to get through. I'm starting to wonder if we've hit a stalemate.

52) ts52: Pass

53) jeep: Move Y2 Cache2 Thumb
jeep: No, pretty sure my new plan will work, it's just slow.
jeep: Bah, I guess I got off a line in my planned moves. I wasn't supposed to move both blue3 to movement, only 1... yet another wasted move. Good thing there isn't a 50 move rule here. ;)

68) ts52: Pass
jeep: I hope not. ;) But it's a tricky plan, so I don't want to make it in a rush. I'm on vacation and will make my move when I'm settled at my destination and not on the road.

Then I'll have the opportunity to set up the doomsday and I'll be able to execute it before you have a chance to invade my space. At least, that's the plan.

jeep: I guess I need a red to make this plan work, eh? Hmm...

97) jeep: Discover G3 Lock R1 Slayer2

98) ts52: Pass
ts52: Yeah, I really didn't want to give one up, but I think it's my only shot at survival... ironically it may hasten my demise. :)

99) jeep: Move B1 Lock Slayer2
ts52: And since I have no yellow, I can't move two ships in there to be able to take either of those systems. Yeah, I'm pretty much screwed...

ts52: Yeah, unfortunately the only way to stop you was to get a small star of my own that I could park blues on, to keep you from building the doomsday machine. But there was just no way that was going to work. Excellent game. Now I know, never let yourself get shut out of yellow!
jeep: Thanks for the game. It was good. Shut out of any color is bad. Shut out of yellow is really bad.
