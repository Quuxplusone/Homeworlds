	dlwillson: On behalf of people that name systems after the piece, would you explain why you do that?
 
To me, the system-names are part of the beauty of the game, and piece-named systems create confusion between systems, ships, and pieces. Moving a b3 to b3 seems less elegant than moving a b3 to arcturus.
	Trydnt: I don't name them when playing with the set so partially habit. The star designations are arbitrary. Most real stars are named things like T-368/b nowadays since they discover so many all the time and a functional designation is more useful. It's much the same here as the name tells you what size it is and means you're less likely to make a mistake in not realizing which size piece you're moving to. Also it's faster to type B3 or something than arcturus so makes coding commands easier. Though if that were the only reason I'd just name them A, B, C, etc... so yeah a balance between speed, efficiency, and less margin for error
