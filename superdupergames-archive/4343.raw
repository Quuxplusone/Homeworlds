	zoltar: I just realized that I chose the same star sizes as you, rendering this a "small" world. I didn't mean to do that, as we are only two steps instead of three from each other's homeworlds. I would have redone that move had I noticed it in time. The game will still be ok, but a lot of the interesting themes will be missing.

22) zoltar: Move Y2 Zoltar Gundam1
	gundam_blade: I'm new to this and confused.  I know you sacrificed your red, but I thought you can only use actions in the system you start with, therefore I thought I would be safe because you didn't have any red to start with in greenbelt.

23) gundam_blade: Trade G2 R2 Gundam1

24) zoltar: Sacrifice R1 Greenbelt
Attack R2 Gundam1

25) gundam_blade: Build Y2 Gundam_blade
	zoltar: no, you can use that power anywhere on the board.  The requirement is that I had to have a medium (or large) ship in the system to capture your medium ship.  Think of it this way: when you sacrifice, it's as if any star you want can become the color of the piece you sacrifice, so here the gundam1 system becomes for the move as if it were a red star instead of the blue star.  I just read your comment after my move, or I would have suggested you undo the move. They will not let you roll back the position more than 1/2 move (you can undo your move once).
