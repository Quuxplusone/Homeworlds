Participants: Babamots (S), LanguiDude (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) LanguiDude: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3
	Babamots: Hi LanguiDude! From your profile, it sounds like you're pretty new to the game. I can give suggestions if you'd like to benefit from my experience, such as it is. :-D

2) Babamots: Homeworld G3 B1 B3 *
	LanguiDude: Heya Babamots. Yeah, I'm very new to the game. I appreciate the offer. I won't mind one bit if you throw out tips here and there. And I hope you don't mind if I pick your brain about why you made certain moves... :-)

3) LanguiDude: Build G1 Languidude
	Babamots: I won't pull any punches, but I'll try to give you warnings about my plans.
 
At the moment, I'm setting up for an "instafreeze." I'll build the last b1 piece on my next turn, so you'll frozen out of blue ships. You will want to trade your g3 for b3 (after a turn or two, but NOT now) so that you can get blue ships. Otherwise, I'll be building medium and large blue ships very soon and I'll have a material advantage.
	LanguiDude: Oh dang, I didnt even realize I was setting myself up for that when I made my Homeworld consist of a b1. Very interesting.
	LanguiDude: Well, I guess I mean Id never thought of that as the second player.

4) Babamots: Build B1 Babamots
	Babamots: Yeah, a b1 or g1 star sets you up for that. It's only really a problem if you don't know how to respond to it.

5) LanguiDude: Trade G3 B3 Languidude
	Babamots: You can trade for b3 on this turn if you want. It will put us basically on even footing.

6) Babamots: Trade B3 Y3 Babamots

7) LanguiDude: Build B2 Languidude

8) Babamots: Build B2 Babamots

9) LanguiDude: Discover B2 Languidude G3 Adama

10) Babamots: Trade B1 G1 Babamots

11) LanguiDude: Trade B2 Y2 Adama
	LanguiDude: I'm never sure how long one should spend building ships at home. I usually feel like getting out into space "early" is advantageous - but that's more of an instinct and less about  reason or experience.

12) Babamots: Build B1 Babamots
	Babamots: If you head out too early, you sometimes get forced to lose diversity in a system. I like to only trade for new colors in a system where I already have (at least) two ships of the same color.
	Babamots: For example, you just lost your only blue ship in Adama. It's harder for you to build blue now.

13) LanguiDude: Build B2 Languidude

14) Babamots: Sacrifice Y3 Babamots
Discover B1 Babamots Y2 Iconia
Move B1 Iconia Adama
Move B1 Adama Languidude
Catastrophe Languidude B

15) LanguiDude: Build Y1 Adama
	Babamots: Our homeworlds are now connected, so you need to be ready to invade or be invaded at a moment's notice (if one of us wins the race for a red ship by more than one turn, that person will win). You don't have access to blue at the moment, so you'll need to build another ship, discover a blue system, and trade for a red.
	Babamots: I'm planning to trade my ships for yellow and red to try to catch you before you can defend yourself.

16) Babamots: Trade G1 Y1 Babamots

17) LanguiDude: Discover Y2 Adama B1 Brill
	LanguiDude: Assuming I can get out of this, that leaves you in a pretty vulnerable position. (But that IS a bold assumption...)

18) Babamots: Move B2 Babamots Languidude
	Babamots: I'm afraid I'm going to win this race. It was close and pretty interesting though.

19) LanguiDude: Move Y1 Adama Languidude

20) Babamots: Trade B2 R2 Languidude

21) LanguiDude: Trade Y2 R2 Brill

22) Babamots: Attack G1 Languidude

	LanguiDude: oh duh, that does it
I was "planning" to build a bunch of ships to drag it out...
	LanguiDude: gg!
	Babamots: So if you didn't notice, the problem in this game was building that blue ship in your home. It let me catastrophe your blue ships and blue star (albeit at the cost of my own y3).
	Babamots: It set you back a bit more than me, and when quarters are tight like that, a tiny advantage tips the scale pretty easily.
	LanguiDude: Yeah, something something "don't let your 3p ship be the same color as a looming catastrophe" - a brutal lesson, but well learned :-D
	LanguiDude: (or at least don't do it unintentionally)
	LanguiDude: this was fun, though - I issued a rematch challenge :-)
	Babamots: GG! And I hope you learned some. Would you like to try again/another lesson?
