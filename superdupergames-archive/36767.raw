	Babamots: That's what I hear about the game of go: you should lose your first 50 games as quickly as possible (or 100 or 500, depending on whom you ask).
 
Getting slaughtered is the traditional way to learn Homeworlds as well, though I'm trying to change that a little by compiling my wisdom on my site and making it available.

	Layana: Cool how you gained a foothold, cut off your homeworld and, due to the scarcity of yellow in the global stash, can threaten an overpopulation without fear of repercussion. I'm starting to like this game :)
	Layana: I meant due to the scarcity of yellow you can get ahead in the big ship count

20) Babamots: Discover Y2 Bajor B3 Bolarus

21) Layana: Move G3 Layana Bolarus
	Babamots: I wouldn't say I "cut off" my homeworld since either of us can always discover a new medium-sized world to connect to me. But yeah, the game is pretty wild. I love it.

22) Babamots: Sacrifice G3 Babamots
Build Y2 Bolarus
Build Y3 Bajor
Build Y3 Babamots
	Layana: So are there any "standard" opening moves I should be aware of?

	Babamots: There's only thing I know of that I would call a standard opening, and that's when a player attempts an instafreeze, and the other player properly trades their original large ship for the frozen color. But even in that case, there are only two or three scripted turns.
 
I think the main thing in the opening is to keep a close eye on the bank and try to think at least two turns ahead. I'm always checking "What will happen if we keep building the colors that we've been working on? Who gets bigger ships faster?" If I'll get the bigger ships, I keep building. If my opponent will get bigger ships, I'll look for a way to change things up (block their builds, trade to start developing another color, threaten an attack on a colony etc.).
	Babamots: By the way, do you know how to review a game once it's over? You can get to an "archive" view from your game history (link on your home page).
