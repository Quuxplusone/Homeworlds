Homeworlds Online (SDG# 6478)
Variants: "Unrated, Sinister"
Started: 2007.2.15, Ended: 2007.6.18
Participants: jan (S), dsheldon (W), Gort (N), zoltar (E)
Winner: zoltar

1) Gort: Homeworld G3 B2 Y3
	dsheldon: OK!  This game filled up sooner than I expected.  This should be great.
 
Phooey, why do I /always/ go last?

2) zoltar: H B2 R1 G3
	Gort: If I take too long to move, send me an email, Zoltar. Then don't wait long before you resign me. Thanks, and Good Skill!

3) jan: Homeworld B3 Y1 G3
	zoltar: Ok.  How do you play 'sinister' btw?  

4) dsheldon: Homeworld R2 B1 G3
	jan: yes what are the differences with sinister? dsheldon. ...playing this game i can't being reminded of H. Sheldon. Harry Sheldon from Issac Asimov's Foundation trilogy. have you read it?
	jan: or was it Harry Seldon?
	zoltar: No, I haven't read it.  But I think you have to destroy one particular opponent to win, and each has to destroy a different one, but I don't know which one. 
	dsheldon: Everyone has to destroy the player to their left (sinister:left::dexter:right, get it?).  If someone else destroys the player to your left, play continues and you now target the new person to your left (your former target's target).
 
And no, I haven't read The Foundation Trilogy, but I do have a cat named Asimov. ;)

5) Gort: Build Y1 Gort

6) zoltar: Build G1 Zoltar
	zoltar: b g1 zoltar

7) jan: Build G1 Jan
	zoltar: Ok, that makes sense!  I suppose that makes the opponent across from you your ally, unless they are about to kill your worst enemy, and which case ironically you'd want to save the team trying to destroy you.
	dsheldon: Less of an ally, more of a guy that really doesn't care.  It's not like he's going to intentionally destroy huge numbers of his own ships to help you out.
 
For additionally irony, if the player to your left is about to win, it is very likely that you will want to destroy the player across from you.  That way, the game continues with three players.
 
So yeah, not an ally at all.

	Gort: Didn't think you'd do it, Zol... I'm in trouble now!
	zoltar: Yup. The problem is that dsheldon can checkmate you in 3 moves or so, and the game is over, so weakening myself to weaken you more doesn't help me.

24) dsheldon: Build G2 Deep
	zoltar: So I'll just make a wimpy move instead...
	Gort: I figured three moves gave enough time for me to come up with something... but no matter; our people persevere. Your alien ways are strange and disturbing to us. We must eradicate you.
	Gort: PS: Thanks for using your time machine.

	zoltar: Geez Gort, with an undefended homeworld, aren't you dead in 2 moves?
	zoltar: Then again, it's dsheldon that would have to kill you to win, and he's weak right now.  That explains your crazy aggression.
	dsheldon: hey, just because I've got four ships to jan's nine, uh...  yeah, little help here?
	zoltar: Perhaps Gort will help you and is planning to invade  Exos, in which case I have no reason to attack him; but as he has three ships in my homeworld, if he attacks further I'll have to place my G3 in his homeworld next turn; as for now, Jan is still not an immediate threat to you, having no ships within one jump of your homeworld.
	zoltar: Then again, Gort has only one yellow piece and can't attack anyone right now; if jan moves tons of pieces into orbits of large stars, by then my homeworld crisis will hopefully be over and Gort will have yellow ships, so we can attack the ships right outside your homeworld.

	zoltar: Jan has been gone for 4 days again...
	dsheldon: I've noticed.  I am loathe to eject him from the game however, as he's the one trying to kill me and I don't want to appear vindictive.  That, and you (Zoltar) will likely annihilate me in short order.
	zoltar: I'd hate to eject anyone because their time was up.  Jan had internet trouble before. This is my first "Sinister" game -- and it's rather interesting.
	Gort: I certainly don't mind waiting.
	zoltar: Attention: Jan hazz knot moved in one cycle of Earth's moon, Luna.  Perhaps the Earthling hazz been sucked into a black hole.  Shall we terminate Jan's fleet now?

	zoltar: Very well.  Zoltar will not destroy your species and supernova your homeworld, but will instead claim your ships for the Zoronian Armada, and make your species loyal minions under the protection of the Great Galactic Emperor Zoltar!!!
