Homeworlds Online (SDG# 13845)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2009.7.17, Ended: 2009.10.15
Participants: jonaskoelker (S), AnalogKid (N)
Winner: AnalogKid

1) AnalogKid: Homeworld Y3 B1 G3

2) jonaskoelker: Homeworld Y2 B1 G3
	AnalogKid: Hello! Thanks for accepting my challenge :)
Have you played Homeworlds before?

3) AnalogKid: Build G1 Analogkid
	jonaskoelker: No, this is my first game.  I don't even have IceHouse pieces, though I have ordered my first set very recently.  I've read the game between Andy and Russell and a few strategy discussions on the icehouse mailing list.  I felt tempted to open with "homeworld G2 Y2 R3", then build, move, attack, but I think that fails when you make the first (real) move (you build, I build, you convert small to red, then I can't move)... oh well...

4) jonaskoelker: Build G1 Jonaskoelker
	AnalogKid: I think you chose a much better opening.  The "banker" homeworld is a good option for new players and the supposedly choosing a homeworld only one hop away from your opponent is not.
 
I have only played Homeworlds twice now myself.  So, I am a newbie too.  I like playing on SDG because you can take several days to think about a turn ^_^
	jonaskoelker: Yeah, that's what I hear.  I also hear Andy prefers "homeworld B2 R1 G3", but maybe yellow will work out fine.
 
In any case, behold the constructive power of my fully armed an operational battlestati... erm, factory ;-)


5) AnalogKid: Trade G1 Y1 Analogkid
	jonaskoelker: By the way, instead of building a small green, could I have sacrificed my large green an built three small ones?
 
Or would I lose because I didn't have any ships in my homeworld?  What if I had G3 R1 in some other system; could I sacrifice the G3 and build three greens?  What if I had just the G3?
 
My interpretation is that star systems "die" "as soon as possible", so I when I sacrifice the lonely G3, its star system disappears before I can use my three build actions. Similarly, the green-producing ability it gave itself would be gone (but other green ships could give it to compensate).
 
Do you know what SDG's interpretation is?

	jonaskoelker: "supposedly choosing a homeworld only one hop away from your opponent is not [good for newbies]."
 
That's interesting.  I think it might--the game would be more tactical (as opposed to strategic)--you need to think a few moves ahead and examine them thoroughly, but you don't need to understand much of the broader, long term strategies that are useful if you want to conquer a large(st) world.
 
I think it's also easier to know how good your position is---you'll probably either be thinking "I could win if only he didn't have that damn..." or "Whew, I would have lost if I hadn't found the defense against [maneuver]."  I think the mid-game in large worlds are closer to "roughly evn", "slightly advantageous" and "moderately advantageous" in range.
 
But I speculate :)

6) jonaskoelker: Trade G1 Y1 Jonaskoelker
	AnalogKid: The 3HOUSE booklet, in the "Game Over" section says:
 
"It's OK to temporarily abandon your Homeworld as long as you have a ship there again by the time your turn is over."
 
(I believe SDG follows this rule).  Additionally, the rule about immediately returning abandoned stars to the bank only applies to non-homeworld star-systems.
 
However, you still could not have sacrificed your large green effectively because you can only build ships of the same color as another ship you control in the target system.  i.e. The colors of your stars and the sacrificed green ship are not usable.  So, you would not have been allowed to build ANY ships if you had sac'd the G3.  If you had had other ships anywhere, you could build new ships of the same color(s) in their systems, being careful to have a ship at your homeworld in the end.
	AnalogKid: I have read of some advanced players starting with a small universe (and presumably a red ship).  I am too new of a player to judge the effectiveness of that strategy or to judge the relative merits of starting with red vs. yellow in the homeworld.  I want to explore the B-Y G3 option for awhile before I move on to the others. :)

7) AnalogKid: Discover Y1 Analogkid G2 Ramandu
	jonaskoelker: So, for instance, if I had (only) a Y3 at my homeworld, I could sacrifice it if I used (at least one of) the moves to move something back there.  Isn't that also the only way in which I can temporarily leave my homeworld empty?

8) jonaskoelker: Discover Y1 Jonaskoelker G3 Alderaan
	AnalogKid: Yes, my understanding is that sacrificing a yellow ship as you describe would be OK.  I was also thinking you could sac your last ship at the homeworld if it was red and take control of an opponent's ship in that system.  However, I see now that that fails too.  The G, R, and B actions all require a ship in the target system (as do sacrifice actions).

9) AnalogKid: Build G1 Analogkid
	jonaskoelker: "We are on a diplomatic mission.  These aren't the death star blueprints you're looking for" ;-)

27) AnalogKid: Build Y2 Ramandu

	AnalogKid: Hi, I see that you've been swamped for awhile with your games, but I'm wondering whether you intend to continue this one.  If so, I'm willing to wait, but if not, I'd like to start another Homeworlds game with someone. (But I don't want two games going at once ...)
	jonaskoelker: Hey, AnalogKid.  Sorry for falling off the planet.  Resigning me was fine.
