38) dougforte: Build G1 Dougforte

39) Laurie_Menke: Move Y1 Colorado Dougforte
	dougforte: It's okay, I appreciate learning, even if it seems to take me a while.  :)
	Laurie_Menke: Oh, no... you're learning quite quickly! I've been telling Andy that he'll have to look out for you soon. This is just a game that takes a long time to get good at.  :)

40) dougforte: Trade G1 R1 Dougforte
	dougforte: Thank you!  I agree, I think it will be several games before I'm able to put up any real challenge.
	dougforte: Is Andy also on the ladder?

41) Laurie_Menke: Sacrifice R2 Colorado
Attack R1 Dougforte
Attack G1 Dougforte
	Laurie_Menke: No, he finds it hard to play on SDG because of the random way new star systems are added to the universe. He prefers to put the pieces in a very specific way and SDG can't do it that way. But hopefully you'll get a chance to challenge him in person sometime soon.  :)

42) dougforte: Build Y1 Dougforte
	Draw5PlayAll: AFAICT they are sorted in alphabetical order.
	Laurie_Menke: Huh... I'd never noticed. I don't think there's any way we could use that fact to create what Andy wants, but I'll have to think about that.
	dougforte: Ah, I see.  I haven't played these games IRL, so for me getting used to how the user interface works here is just part of learning the game, but I certainly understand having issues with it (or any interface in general).
	dougforte: Also real pieces can be quite nice, and I'm sure that's true for some of these pyramid sets.  :)

43) Laurie_Menke: Build Y2 Dougforte
Catastrophe Dougforte Y
	Laurie_Menke: Oh absolutely, dougforte! You'll probably find more people to play with here on SDG, but nothing beats playing with the real pieces.  :)
	Laurie_Menke: Oops! Don't forget about catastrophes! Either side can call a catastrophe. Would you like to undo that last move?
	dougforte: Ah, thanks for the reminder.  :)  At least I checked ships this time, but I'll have to remember to look at all pieces, including system markers...

	dougforte: Good sacrifice!  I'm lucky there's still a move for me, options seem to be limited...
	Laurie_Menke: Yes, I'm afraid you're nearing the end of your game unless you pull off something unexpected.
	Laurie_Menke: Thanks for the fun! I expect you to be a force to be reckoned with very soon!  Feel free to challenge me any time!  :)
	dougforte: I will, once I get off the bottom of the ladder, of course.  :)
	dougforte: Very soon may be optimistic, there's still a lot for me to learn.  Anyway, thanks for the game!
	Laurie_Menke: :)
