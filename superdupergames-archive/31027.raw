	Draw5PlayAll: I used the correct form, Qo'noS, as a red star a while back since red = warriors.

21) mi_spero: Move R2 Mi_spero Tamaran
	Babamots: I prefer to use the English spelling for consistency (I don't insist on saying "Deutschland" either).

22) Babamots: Sacrifice G3 Babamots
Build G2 Kronos
Build Y2 Babamots
Build G3 Babamots
	mi_spero: Well, Deutschland makes more sense. I don't speak German, but it's more than a bit weird that the Germans speak Deutsch, the Dutch speak Nederlands (or something like that), and the Netherlands isn't even a country, it's a region. Some words obviously weren't borrowed into English by linguists.
	Babamots: I'm OK with calling Netherlands a country since its American municipalities are pretty minor. I always forget what the deal is with "Holland," though. I'm also stubborn enough to keep saying "Ivory Coast."

Move G2 Kronos Mi_spero
Catastrophe Mi_spero G

	Babamots: Sorry about the double whammy tonight with catastrophes in both games. I guess this Kronos was pretty warlike as well :-(.
	Draw5PlayAll: What is Wadi?
	Babamots: It's the home system of the game-loving people in the DS9 episode "Move Along Home."
	mi_spero: Ehh, to be expected given my skill at this game. :D
	mi_spero: gg
	Babamots: gg
