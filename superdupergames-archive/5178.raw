Catastrophe Hedge_o_matic Yellow

	Hedge_o_Matic: Geh!  Peak Oil did me in.  I really suck at this game, online, it seems.  Without physical pyramids, I'm totally lost.  I'd say "good game", but this can't have been a very satisfying victory for you.
I'll do better next time!
	jeep: :(  I was actually hoping that there was some sneak attack in there someplace that I didn't see.  Thanks for the game.
	Hedge_o_Matic: I'll play a few more online games, and challenge you when I think I can actually offer a challenge...
	jeep: I'm not very good at the game, so it shouldn't take long.  ;)
