	Laurie_Menke: Hi ts52... I just wanted to let you and w00t know that I'm making a list of games to ask Aaron to end due to abandonment.  I know you are both currently active on SDG right now, but this game seems abandoned, so I am going to include it on the list unless one of you says not to in the next 24 hours.  I hope that's the right thing to do.  :)
	ts52: Laurie, that's fine. In this case I can terminate the game, but since I've forgotten about my SDG games on more than one occasion, I have a tendency to let time lapse for up to a month before I do.
	Laurie_Menke: ts52, Aaron did his sweep but didn't take this one out, so I guess you'll have to do it yourself if you want to.  :)
	ts52: Thanks Laurie. I'll give it another week or so.
	Laurie_Menke: :)
