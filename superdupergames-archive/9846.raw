Winner: ahoodedfigure

1) ahoodedfigure: Homeworld G3 B3 R3 *
	ahoodedfigure: Oh, shit.  I'm first.  Watch me screw up.  I never did get to experiment like I wanted to before.  You mind starting a new one if my experiment doesn't work?

2) peio: Homeworld Y3 G3 R3 *

3) ahoodedfigure: Build R1 Ahoodedfigure
	peio: no prblm, I know the feeling  ;) 
	ahoodedfigure: My tactic works better if I go second.

4) peio: Build R1 Peio
	ahoodedfigure: Sheesh.  About damn time.  I don't know how many commands I did before that worked.

5) ahoodedfigure: Trade R1 Y1 Ahoodedfigure
	peio: same ! Each turn it takes me 4 times b4 it takes my order.
I thought one could build a given color in a system as long as the system piece is of that color ?!
	ahoodedfigure: I thought that was what the rules said.  Apparently this thing thinks it has to match a ship type.  So, what good are the planet colors?

6) peio: Discover R3 Peio B2 Whrdahellrwee2
	ahoodedfigure: I had a baby!  I always wanted to have a baby!!

7) ahoodedfigure: Build Y1 Ahoodedfigure
	peio: Finally, I get to name a system ! (2nd move of 2nd game !!)
	ahoodedfigure: Yeah...  and that's a real nice...  name.  "name."

8) peio: Build R1 Peio

9) ahoodedfigure: Trade Y1 B1 Ahoodedfigure

10) peio: Move R1 Peio Whrdahellrwee2

11) ahoodedfigure: Build Y1 Ahoodedfigure
	peio: I sorta don't know what to do to win...
	ahoodedfigure: wipe out my homeworld's defenses, I think
	ahoodedfigure: I'll have to leave this one hanging.  Should be in bed.  Later.

12) peio: Trade R1 G1 Whrdahellrwee2
	ahoodedfigure: Actually, according to the rules, you can't take an action that will destroy your own homeworld.  It's not allowed.  Which means your Palpatine Manuever was an illegal move.

13) ahoodedfigure: Discover Y1 Ahoodedfigure B2 Lappland

14) peio: Build R1 Peio
	ahoodedfigure: wow, I managed to do it right the first time

15) ahoodedfigure: Build B1 Ahoodedfigure
	peio: not me... I fnd it (a bit) annoying I must say. Each time i try to do smtg it is first denied because i missed a rule detail. Then it takes for ever to perform smtg ... Will see how the game evolves as we move on.

16) peio: Build R1 Whrdahellrwee2
	ahoodedfigure: Since there are a lot of factors at work it's understandable.  If we were playing this in person moves would take seconds.  Then again, if we were playing my space conquering game, once you understood the basic principles, movement would be even MORE intuitive...  :)
	ahoodedfigure: There's a video game called Mass Effect coming out now that's going to make me space-obsessed for many, many weeks.  Just warning you.

17) ahoodedfigure: Trade B1 G1 Ahoodedfigure
	peio: oookay

	ahoodedfigure: The rising tension...  OF THE STARS!!
	ahoodedfigure: did you actually make up the name of your planet, or was that just randomly given?
	ahoodedfigure: ...  IN THE GREAT VOID!!
	peio: i decided the name. 2 comes from previous game. I named the new sytsem the same way on the previous game

23) ahoodedfigure: Move Y2 Lappland Peio

24) peio: Build R2 Peio

Attack R1 Peio
