	JIMBO: No problem!  Say, this weekend my friends and I were playing a bunch of Binary (and Trinary) Homeworlds and we ran into a couple of grey areas - d'you think you could settle a couple of rule disputes for us?
	andylooney: certainly.

	JIMBO: When you sacrifice a ship - 1. if it's a green ship, does it go back into the stash before you pick the pieces to synthesize, and 2. if sacrificed ship is the last ship in a system, does the system still exist until the end of the turn, or is it immediately dissolved?
	andylooney: 1.) Yes, a sacrificed ship goes back into the bank before any new pieces are grown.
	andylooney: 2.) At the instant when the last ship leaves a star system, the piece goes into the bank.
	andylooney: These 2 points are vital to the strategy known as investing, i.e. parking a green at a large yellow then growing the system marker as a ship when yellow is otherwise exhausted.
	andylooney: I'm happy to say that when I discovered this system wasn't handling this properly, Aaron fixed it right away!
	JIMBO: And one other thing - if you have the yellow system, a small yellow ship, and a large green ship, and you sacrifice the large green, can you grow green ships (with that sacrifice action) in that system, or is yellow the only option?
	andylooney: Yellow is the only option. You must have a ship of the type you want to grow in the system in order to make more of them.
