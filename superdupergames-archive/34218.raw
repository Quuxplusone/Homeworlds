	mneme: I think they're going just fine! <eg>
 
I should really play a bunch of unrated games outside my comfort zone, though.
	Laurie_Menke: Since you're probably one of the top 20 players in the world, it's pretty hard to get outside your comfort zone!  ;)  But wil is a great opponent for that sort of thing. He loves thinking outside the box.  :)
	Laurie_Menke: Just an FYI... I'll be camping starting later today until Monday. I have the time on the clock, and I need time to think about what to do here, so I probably won't take my move until Tuesday.
	mneme: Wow, I don't know how but my earlier message didn't get through: Something like "Admittedly, I'm pretty experienced at regular play, but I have next to no experience with microverse and small universe play, which given my defensive strategy is a big weakness".
	mneme: That's fine; I'll not expect a move from you for a few days.  It's not hard time in any case, so if your clock runs down I'll be pretty forgiving for a while in any case.

	Laurie_Menke: I won't let it run down... don't worry. I'll be making a move tomorrow.  :)  As for the micro and small universes, I'm happy to play but have equally little experience. Wil is really the guy you want.

	mneme: It's true -- WIl's the only person I can think of who's done some fairly serious play in microverses and SUs.  I did try a microverse on defense recently, but...it was short (I did not lose): http://superdupergames.org/main.html?page=play_homeworlds&num=34333
	Laurie_Menke: Well, now that the tournament has started, I guess I know what to do to give myself at least a bit of a chance!  ;)
	Laurie_Menke: BTW... ouch on the three 3-sized ships you just built!  :/

	Laurie_Menke: Thanks for the game, mneme! Hopefully I'll do better in the tournament!  Congrats!  :)
	mneme: Thanks -- good game, and good luck in the tournament!
 
Are you going to be at Gencon?
	Laurie_Menke: Thanks! Yes... Looney Labs will have a tiny booth and I'll be there! If you'll be there, too, come stop by and play with us!  :)
	mneme: Will do; see you there!
