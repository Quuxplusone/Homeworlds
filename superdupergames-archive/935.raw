Homeworlds Online (SDG# 935)
Started: 2005.10.11, Ended: 2005.10.14
Participants: MatrixFrog (S), lambda (N)
Winner: lambda

1) lambda: Homeworld B3 Y2 G3

2) MatrixFrog: Homeworld G1 B3 Y3
lambda: Hello! It looks like you like playing this game a lot.
MatrixFrog: Yeah. It's why I joined the site, but I like the other games too. I just don't get to play this at all in real life, because I don't have friends who are into it.

3) lambda: Build G1 Lambda

4) MatrixFrog: Build Y1 Matrixfrog
lambda: Yeah, this game is why I joined the site, too. I actually can find some people to play it with in real live, but most of them have just learned it and so I kill them easily with a cheap attack (everyone forgets about catastrophes at first). Playing on here has let me play people who are actually good (including Andy Looney).

5) lambda: Build G1 Lambda
MatrixFrog: I'm ALWAYS thinking about catastrophes. I probably use them too much.
lambda: Yeah, once you've played a few times, you think about catastrophes. I'm now trying to figure out how to effectively defeat an opponent who plays reasonably defensively; if they don't let you have any large pieces, and keep their colors spread out to avoid catastrophe, and have a large and a red in their homeworld, it seems really hard to get anything done.

6) MatrixFrog: Build Y1 Matrixfrog
lambda: I like the way you can do normally dangerous things at the beginning of the game, like this.
