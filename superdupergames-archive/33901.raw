	Felix: Good luck :) do I need to fill out a game start form?

	Babamots: Heck. I need to play when I can focus or this is going to happen again.
	Felix: I hear you. I tend to rush my moves too. Take your time though, no pressure from me! And you're not conquered yet; I'm still in a fairly weak position. This has been an interesting game!

31) Felix: Build B2 Rim
	Babamots: Yeah, I make things interesting by not noticing any threats :-P.

32) Babamots: Discover G2 Pakled Y3 Cardassia
	Babamots: I've got three presentations to give this week, and I'm totally unprepared for two of them. If I make any moves before Monday, you can tell me to get back to work.
	Felix: Haha, you know you won't be able to resist making a move before then. You have to take breaks from presentation prep at some point! Homeworlds is more important anyway. Priorities, man ;)

34) Babamots: Move G2 Pakled Rim
	Felix: Hope your presentations went well!
	Babamots: There's one more to go. It's the longest and there's the least to say.

	Felix: Very nice move! Didn't anticipate that one.

40) Babamots: Build G1 Cardassia
	Babamots: It was a high cost to me, but after a lot of thought, nothing else was looking promising.

41) Felix: Build G2 Felix
	Felix: Very promising. I'm beginning to sweat!
	Babamots: Darn! I had my move entered and then it wasn't my turn anymore.

42) Babamots: Build G2 Babamots
	Felix: Sorry about that! To be fair, it only took me about 40 seconds to undo my move

43) Felix: Discover G2 Felix B3 Bazoik
	Babamots: No problem. If you're quicker than me, so be it. I've got an alert on my phone for when I get SDG email, so I can move pretty promptly if I'm focused.

80) Babamots: Trade G3 Y3 Babamots
	Felix: Looks like all the dominoes are lining up :)
	Babamots: It's a ticklish spot, but I'm not quite doomed yet, am I? Maybe you can see a few moves deeper.
	Felix: Oh no, haha, I don't think you're doomed at all. There's just a lot of pieces on the board, so something is probably going to blow up soon!
	Babamots: Well, here comes a wild move. I'm a little desperate to hold onto yellow and I think it's worth the price.

	Babamots: I felt like I was under your thumb while you had all that yellow. I'm going to try to make sure that doesn't happen again. :-)

Pass
	Babamots: It's painful to look at this game and continuing to play is sort of an insult to you by suggesting that I could beat you from here. So honestly I should resign, but that would feel like a rage quit. I'll stick around for a few more moves and see how I feel.

	Felix: Thank you. Really great game! This was a wild one and you played really well. Good luck and hope to see you in the final!
	Draw5PlayAll: So what is the status on the tourney? I lost the google doc link
