	Babamots: Looks like you've been on break from SDG since about the time I started. How is it being back?
	Simon: I've been here in 2014-2017, yeah, mostly for Homeworlds. I don't get to play it in real life anymore and missed it; at least Zendo happens often. The player page on SDG still loads as slowly as ever. :-) But the full site rewrite seems to be underway and healthy.

	Babamots: I missed that that would wreck my plan to get an r3. I think that's it for me. Maybe I'll get good enough to challenge you someday!

gg, looking forward to a rematch, I'll open a standing challenge for whenever you feel like it!
	Draw5PlayAll: Pakled sounds familiar...
	Babamots: In Star Trek, the Pakleds are a race that don't seem to be very bright. I make a world called Pakled when I'm feeling like I've made big mistakes.
	Draw5PlayAll: I remember that one now.
