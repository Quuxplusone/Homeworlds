	bhorner: I think it would be fun to test the system rendering, make an unrated game, where no one calls catastrophes, and put all pieces in a single system, just to see what it looks like.  :)

	bhorner: I like Homeworlds, I haven't really played it much outside a small group of friends.  :)  I've played here once in a while over the years, hopefully it sticks this time!
	w00t: I got introduced to Homeworlds on the tabletop through a buddy many moons ago... We've both since moved away, and just barely returned here not too long ago... I'm still dusting off my memory banks, but this game is so awesome that even if you're playing against someone who's "better" than you are, it's still going to be a fun game that anyone can win :D
