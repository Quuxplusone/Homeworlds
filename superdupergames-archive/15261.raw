	dethdukk: g'day.  thanks for letting me take banker.

4) dethdukk: Build G1 Dethdukk
	dethdukk: so, after reviewing your past games, I notice that you never actually lost to andy looney...  so why is it that you are considered the second best?  as andy is the world champ at this point.

8) dethdukk: Trade G1 Y1 Dethdukk

9) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort
	TwoShort: dangit, I've been composing a lengthy reply to your question and not paying enough attention :) should have built yellow.

10) dethdukk: Build G2 Dethdukk
	dethdukk: It worked! Actually, I really did just ask cause i was curious.  I am liking this start, but I have no clue how to run banker (I actually prefer fortress) so I guess we will see how this turns out.

11) TwoShort: Discover G1 Twoshort G2 Greenorama
	TwoShort: So, the lengthy response:  
Who says I'm second best?!  :)  Actually, I know someone wrote that in the wiki some number of years ago; but I don't know who or if they still think so.  Definitive Homeworlds rankings do not exist.  Andy is world champion because he won the annual tournament at the Origins game convention; but the tournament is not terribly well attended, and I've never been to it.  If I did go, I expect I'd lose.  I beat Andy all 3 times we played here, but I've played him in person maybe 6 times and lost every one. I expect there are several people who would ususally be better than me under the time constraints of in-person play.  Around here, when I can take 20 minutes (or 2 days) to think about a move any time I want, I'm pretty good :)  My completely stratospheric rating here should imply I'm completely dominant, but honestly there's at least 3 players I wouldn't bet beating the next time we play.
	TwoShort: How to play Banker:  Move greens out to 3s (often yellow) in hopes that when that color is gone you can sacrifice the ships to build stars as ships without my ever getting a crack at them.
  How to play Goldilocks: Move out to 2s, choosing the color based on what to pull out of the stash and control who gets the 3s.  for example...


12) dethdukk: Discover G2 Dethdukk G3 Smallstep
	TwoShort: A vast number of other strategies and guidelines also apply, but that's my nutshell analysis of the strategies uniquely available based on opening.
	dethdukk: hm, so next turn you sac the g3 to get 2 g3s and a g2...  I *think* the best move is...

15) TwoShort: Trade G2 R2 Twoshort

16) dethdukk: Build Y2 Dethdukk

17) TwoShort: Move Y1 Twoshort Greenorama
	dethdukk: hm, that was annoying...  so judging by how you normally play, that means that you either see a way to use that ship soon, or you did that just to stop me from getting a g3.

18) dethdukk: Build G2 Dethdukk

19) TwoShort: Sacrifice G3 Twoshort
Build G3 Twoshort
Build Y2 Twoshort
Build Y2 Greenorama
	TwoShort: I generally want to use it, or have it force you to take a red also (The Gun Rule); since you could safely ignore it, yes, it was just the best move that stopped you getting the 3.  Of course, now that I've got it, I'll try to develop the treat and force you to take a red when you'd rather do something else.
	dethdukk: hm, odd.  I undid my turn, and it says it is my turn (to me at least), but all i got is an undo button.

	dethdukk: ya got me.  you want to play it out, or call it?

30) dethdukk: Trade G2 B2 Dethdukk
	TwoShort: I'm always happy to play it out, but it's up to you; I'd rather you resign not be having fun.  
  By my reckoning, I've got only a slight material advantage at the moment; but I can gain a big one this turn.  Personally, I don't resign until I can see exactly how the opponent can force victory no matter what I do; and I don't see that here quite yet.

	TwoShort: OK, now I've got you :)  You can make me take two more turns to win instead of one, but that's it.  Anyway, nice game; you were right with me until I got you in the grow-a-3-or-defend-vs-red bind, and  you made it awfully hard to finally close the door after that.
	dethdukk: Thank ya much.  Yeah, I felt that you were always just one step ahead.  Did much better than the last time I played against you in any case.  Thanks for the game, hope to do another when some of mine end and college slows down a bit.
