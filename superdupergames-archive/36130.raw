Homeworlds Online (SDG# 36130)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2020.3.10, Ended: 2020.5.13
Participants: capi3101 (S), Shobu (N)
Winner: capi3101

1) Shobu: Homeworld G3 B2 R3
	capi3101: This one I've played a lot of recently. Babamots and wil are the best players on the site (which makes sense given that they were among the original playtesters unless I'm very much mistaken). Babamots is the kind of teacher that will beat you and tell you how to improve. Wil is the kind of teacher that will beat you with a barbed-wire covered bat with a chainsaw on the end... ;)
	capi3101: You still learn from him though.
	capi3101: There's an overview of the rules as well as strategy tips for the game online; Google "pyramid arcade rules pdf" for the latest version. Babamots also has a good strategy guide at https://jpeterbaker.github.io/homeworlds/site/strategyGuide.html
	Shobu: Read lots of good things about this one! Really wanna try :) Will save the strategy guide too.

2) capi3101: Homeworld G1 B3 Y3

3) Shobu: Build R1 Shobu

4) capi3101: Build Y1 Capi3101
	capi3101: Generally the second move is always building a new ship. It's the only thing that makes sense...
	Shobu: ok, time for Homeworlds now!
	Shobu: i am totally confused by the command system .. how  to build a ship? Seems i am forced to build a R1.
 
Can't find another command than this..
build R1 inhomeworld
	capi3101: You are. You can only build ships that are the same color as other ~ships~ you have at the system involved. Because your only ship right now is red, you can build red ships. Or you can change the color of your red ship to something else - those are the only two actions that should be available to you right now...there's no one to attack, and you lack yellow so you cannot move.
	capi3101: Incidentally, you only have to type in the first letter of the command for the system to recognize it. You could type "b r1 Shobu" and the system would recognize it as "build r1 Shobu".
	capi3101: Have you played Homeworlds before IRL?

5) Shobu: Build R1 Shobu
	Shobu: oh ok i had to use my name as the System name .. i think i tried everything except this. 
No, never tried this game before.
	capi3101: I've played multiple times; gotten my butt kick multiple times too. I'll direct you to the Pyramid Arcade rules PDF. Homeworlds starts on page 20 and there's a section on strategy in it worth reviewing.

Also, Babamots has an online strategy guide here:
 
https://jpeterbaker.github.io/homeworlds/site/strategyGuide.html
 
Inexperienced players have a tendency to get trounced by experienced players (and badly). I typically offer three free moves as a handicap but so far nobody's taken me up on it.
	capi3101: When I go to name new systems I tend to use the Hebrew alphabet just as a change of pace from the Greek. But use whatever names you want to. A lot of the more experienced players on the site give the piece type for their system names. Never really have asked what they do in the case of duplicates...
	capi3101: Anyways, good luck. Suck as I do at this game, I do enjoy it quite a bit.

6) capi3101: T Y1 B1 Capi3101

7) Shobu: Trade R1 Y1 Shobu
	Shobu: thanks for the links!
I guess i will play this first match without reading the guide, just to discover the basic interactions. 
	capi3101: Do be careful not to build red next turn. With four of any piece color at a system, either player can call catastrophe and force all pieces of that color back to the bank. If the system piece is forced to return, anything that would be left there also goes.

8) capi3101: Build Y1 Capi3101
	Shobu: good to know, i somewhat overlooked this ..

9) Shobu: Discover R3 Shobu G1 Shobu1

10) capi3101: Build B1 Capi3101

11) Shobu: Build R1 Shobu1

12) capi3101: Discover Y1 Capi3101 G2 Aleph

13) Shobu: Move Y1 Shobu Shobu1

14) capi3101: Move B1 Capi3101 Aleph
	capi3101: It's generally ~very~ unwise to move your large ship away from your homeworld. You're probably okay with doing that for now but you're going to want to get it back there before too long.

15) Shobu: Move R3 Shobu1 Shobu
	Shobu: hmmm i thought that moving my R3 could be a good move ..

16) capi3101: Build B1 Aleph

17) Shobu: Build R1 Shobu1
	Shobu: ok, R3 went back home
	capi3101: It's for defense - without a large at your homeworld, I could take it over with a medium (or even a small if I played things correctly).

18) capi3101: Build B2 Aleph
	capi3101: I do need to get into red - and soon.
	Shobu: why can't i attack Aleph with R1? "You do not have access to sufficient weapons technology (RED) in this sector."
 
i don't see such limitation explained in the rules

19) Shobu: B R2 Shobu1
	capi3101: You have to have a presence in a system before you can attempt to use a power there. You have no ships there, ergo you can't attack me. By the same token, we can't grow ships at each other's homeworlds, or change their colors.
 
Moreover, attacking is a one-two punch and has to be carefully planned. You have to move the attacking craft in before you ~can~ attack with it. It gives me a chance to get away...or counter-attack if I can. 
	capi3101: Sacrificing the red ship wouldn't avail you either - you'd still have no presence there to take advantage of it.
 
Read up on sacrifice plays. Seriously. They win the most games.

20) capi3101: T B2 R2 Aleph

21) Shobu: Build R2 Shobu

22) capi3101: Discover R2 Aleph Y1 Bet

23) Shobu: Trade R2 Y2 Shobu

24) capi3101: Build B2 Aleph
	capi3101: In the hopes that you'll continue to play this game in the future, I need to let you know that you are in danger of losing the game on my next move. I ~could've~ ended it just now.
	capi3101: Your situation is known as a Bluebird...all your ships at your home system are the same color. Because you have three ships there, all I need to do is move in the fourth and then call catastrophe. With no ships at your home system, you lose.
	capi3101: I could've sacrificed my large yellow at my homeworld to move the red in. That's how I could've won.
 
Note that my red is ~still~ in a position to cause a game-ending catastrophe. You need to trade something at your homeworld next turn.
	Shobu: Oh i thought catastrophe was only triggered when there was 4 same-colored ships from one side, not both players.. yes that makes no sense now that i've come to think of it..

25) Shobu: D R2 Shobu1 G2 Gamma

26) capi3101: Move B1 Aleph Bet

27) Shobu: Build R2 Gamma

35) Shobu: Move R3 Shobu1 Shobu

36) capi3101: T B1 R1 Aleph

37) Shobu: Build R2 Shobu1
	capi3101: That was probably not the best move I could've made, but I'll let it stand rather than take it back.

38) capi3101: Build R3 Aleph

39) Shobu: Build R3 Shobu

40) capi3101: Build G2 Bet

45) Shobu: Trade R1 B1 Delta

46) capi3101: Sacrifice R3 Aleph
Attack R3 Shobu
Attack G3 Shobu
Attack Y2 Shobu
	capi3101: Unfortunately, that move sets you up for a slow catastrophe at your Homeworld. Here's how:

	capi3101: From the rules, re: Sacrifice Actions - "Each action may be performed in ~any system you occupy~, even if you don't have access to that color in that system. Sacrificing a ship gives you temporary access to that color in any system you occupy."
 
You occupy a system if you've got at least one ship there. 
	capi3101: Homeworlds is definitely a game with a relatively steep learning curve; it's as complex as chess, and it is very unforgiving of mistakes...just yesterday I won against an opponent who had me on the ropes because he made a crucial mistake at exactly the wrong time.
	capi3101: If you're willing to give it another go, let me know. Meantime I'm going to go ahead and wrap this one up.
