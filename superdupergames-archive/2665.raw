8) sketchwick: Build G2 Sketchwick
sketchwick: is this going badly for me?

9) TwoShort: Discover G1 Twoshort B3 Bluestar
TwoShort: Not so far. A quick rundown of my thinking at this point: I'd like to use the "Factory": sacrifice a g3 to grow 3 peices, including the same g3 you sacrificed in the first place. I could do it now to grab both g2s, but that would let you get the remaining g3, which is what we're really after. So I could grow one g2, but then you could factory and again get the G3. So I won't grow, and must move or trade.

10) sketchwick: Build G2 Again

11) TwoShort: Trade G1 Y1 Bluestar
sketchwick: Oh, do you know how undo works on SDG? Once per game or something?
TwoShort: I beleive it is once per game.

12) sketchwick: Discover G1 Again G1 Good
TwoShort: Continuing my series of tips, the technique I'm demostrating now is called "Blowing It". Sigh.

TwoShort: Switching to plan B...

17) TwoShort: Sacrifice Y2 Bluestar
Discover Y2 Bluestar B2 Bomber
Discover Y1 Bluestar Y2 Denial
sketchwick: I thought you'd do that, but no clue how I should respond
TwoShort: I might have moved the large green to a blue system. But taking a red is not a bad choice as evidenced by the fact I'm not sure what to do in response. Andy Looneys "draw your gun" rule says to always immediately take red when your opponent does. It's a good rule; and while I sometimes ignore it, I often regret doing so.

18) sketchwick: Trade G3 Y3 Sketchwick
TwoShort: By the way, on the undo, I now beleive it is once per move, which makes more sense... one could of course ask Aaron for the definitive answer...
