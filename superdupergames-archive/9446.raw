33) Charlemagne: Move B2 Charlemagne Frogstar
	wyons: yaargh! I feared that you might do that Zoltar- but it was a gamble I couldnt resist. I thought you wouldnt do it because it weakens you...  :)
	zoltar: It does weaken me a little, but it weakens you a lot, so it is worth a slight weakening; also, now that I'm more weak, (I was the strongest, getting the first 2-pip ship), now I'm less of a target, being 3 ships and several tempi behing the other two; the two strong players will be keeping each other in check while you and I try to catch up.
 
The alternative, not take responsibility and allow you to have two 3-pip ships and a commanding lead, might have just come back to haunt me, and I'd find myself in your position now, had I neglected to stop you when I did. 
 
If this were instead a 'sinister' variation, where you win when you kill the fleet to your left, I never would have made the move, as now Charlemagne would go for the kill and finish you off and win the game.  But in a standard game, it would be a waste of Charlemagne's resources to attack you, as it's of no benefit and you pose no threat; and again, I can catch up with some extra free moves as soon as the two leaders lock horns, I figure.  
	wyons: Yes I feared you might make an analysis along those lines- time will tell if the disadvantage to both of us is terminal.
	wyons: --- but you are forgiven in the interests of cosmic compassion. 

34) wyons: Build G1 Mongoose
	NMcCoy: Wait, I'm a leader now? Eep!
	zoltar: Not only that, but now you're the only one with a gun...
	NMcCoy: It's for self-defense! Really!
Actually, I mostly wanted another color to build. I didn't want to overload on yellow, or take the last small blue or green.

	zoltar: Banzai!!!

61) Charlemagne: Move G3 Frogstar Charlemagne
	wyons: hey guys (N & W)... I think Zoltar might be a klingon!
	NMcCoy: Well, it's risky and you guys might gang up on me, but I feel compelled to secure the position of Not Last.

62) wyons: Build G1 Wyons
	Charlemagne: ouch - thanks for the action, Zoltar
and thanks for the not last McCoy.... I may even feel happier now 

63) NMcCoy: Build R1 Nmccoy
	zoltar: I figured it was in NMcCoy's best interest to not kill me but to take out the G3 in frogstar, before it could retreat to the Charlemagne homeworld.
 
That would have left NMcCoy in the best position by far, with me having weakened myself twice and both Charlemagne and Wyons without a 3-pip ship.
 
Now Charlemagne is stronger than I would have been after weakening myself -- I didn't think NMcCoy would choose the scenario where he's clearly in second place to one where he's clearly the alpha player, but he went against his own self-interest, which I didn't at all expect. 
 
And you should feel happier now, Charlemagne, as you're in a great position since NMcCoy allowed you to move your new Battlestar to your homeworld and retain the lead in the game.

64) Charlemagne: Trade B2 R2 Frogstar
	NMcCoy: Ack, I hadn't considered that. I'm still pretty new to the game ,especially multiplayer, and hadn't thought of what /everyone/'s next move might be.

65) wyons: Build B1 Wyons
	zoltar: Well, there is something to be said for eliminating any player at low cost, as now your winning chances increase from 1/4 to 1/3 if everything else were equal.
