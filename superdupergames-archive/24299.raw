	wil: have you any idear what a relief that is you finally blew that up??
	SilentTitan: Bugging you was it?
	SilentTitan: Ok... So I believe this is checkmate.... I don't believe you can do anything to stop it.  my next move is:
 
Sacrifice Y3 Silenttitan
move g2 silenttitan wil
move g1 silentttian wil
move g2 tic wil
catastrophe wil green
 
you can undo your last move and see if there is anything you can do.  I did want you to be aware of what I was going to do before I did it .... because it's hard to see what happened after it happens.
 

	SilentTitan: nevermind.... I found an issue
	SilentTitan: turns out you could sac your y3 and move the three blue ships in your homeworld to kill the Tic system and that would have taken my third green away so I would not have been able to cat your homeworld.  
	wil: argghh...I missed it.   So in reality I didn't start another game while we were in one...I was out and didn't realize it...I was looking elsewhere and didn't see that...nice play, thanx
