	wil: I'm just a s simple man, sending my space ships to solar systems with simple names...
	wil: I try not to get attached, makes it easier to abandon the star

	wil: Cool!  In this game when you started with the blue instafreeze I usually immediately get a blue 3 to catch up...but instead I thought I could keep you from getting a big ship by making them all stars...then I really don't care if you have a blue monopoly...but also gained the green monopoly, and will now try to get all the large ships.

	capi3101: At least I drew blood. Thats more that can be said for our matches to date.

37) wil: Attack Y1 Wil
	wil: Yes blowing up half a homeworld feels good...but unless you have the armament to take out the other half...it is mute.  So I shall gather all the items needed for catastrophe...

	wil: I think I slipped out of a sticky wicket!  However it ends, excellent effort!

	capi3101: Red catastrophe crossed my mind. Dont know why I didnt go with it - it wouldve been much more dramatic. Mustve been distracted...
	capi3101: So from here, I build y2, you move in R3, I build Y3, you take your pick of finishing me off-either sacrificing the other R3 to snap up all the pieces at once or moving in yellow to cat all my ships. Games up in two either way.
	capi3101: Ill have to go back and look to see if I couldve waited the one turn to build another yellow ship. I think impatience killed me this time. Im definitely going to mention this game to Babamots for his strategy guide.
	capi3101: Anyway, good game.
	wil: It definitely got dicey...  I can't wait till working ai actually figures out this game.  There has got to be the best move at each point, and the job is to capitalize on it when anyone makes less than that.
	Babamots: I love the ending of this game! Do you mind if I borrow it as an example for my site? I think it's very instructive.
	capi3101: I've got no problems with that; figured it'd be a good one to send your way.
