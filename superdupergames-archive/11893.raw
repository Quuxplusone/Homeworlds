17) TwoShort: Build Y2 Grogar

18) shadowfirebird: Build G2 Frogstarb
TwoShort: Actually, I don't mind at all. I myself periodically notice something bad about a move immediately after I make it, and I'd like to feel free to hit undo in those situations. It will only let you hit it once per move; and just naturally you don't wind up doing it except right after making a move, so the chances of the other guy putting much time into considering the wrong position are inherently small. So anyway, don't worry about it, and be advised that I won't. :)
