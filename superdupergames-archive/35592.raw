39) Babamots: Discover Y1 Babamots G3 Gravesworld
	ajo: This is an interesting game. I was really losing (right after my "Bah" comment as I fell into the Yellowbird trap yet again), but for the past several turns it's felt like I'm ahead and the only thing stopping me from cruising to victory is the fact that none of my ships can, um, move. :D
	Babamots: I think you can't technically be ahead since I could just pass forever :-D.
	Babamots: This might be my favorite match I've played. Super interesting.

42) ajo: Build G2 Ajo

43) Babamots: Move R2 Babamots Risa
	Babamots: Sorry for all the undo's. It's a narrow rail I'm trying to walk.

44) ajo: Trade R2 G2 Alpha

45) Babamots: Build R2 Risa
	Babamots: I'm curious how you feel about the position now. Any different? You can tell me later if you don't want to give anything away.

46) ajo: Pass
	ajo: Well, I saw you building your Doomsday Machine since a few turns ago (I mean that's when it really got urgent for me and I failed to get all the blue fast enough to prevent you). But I also think you can't get close enough to one-two catastrophe me without sacrificing a yellow and letting me get it. You're definitely ahead, anyway. :)

47) Babamots: Sacrifice Y1 Gravesworld
Discover Y3 Gamma Y1 Zakdorn
	Babamots: Risa is crowded. Must be the tourist season.

48) ajo: Build G3 Ajo

49) Babamots: Move R2 Risa Zakdorn

50) ajo: Pass
	Babamots: Here comes the fun part...

51) Babamots: Move B1 Risa Zakdorn
	Babamots: And I suddenly realize that the move I'd been planning for days probably isn't the best.

52) ajo: Pass
	Babamots: My concern with sacrificing a y1 in Risa was that you could have moved a g1 to my new system and, if I didn't attack it, you could move g1 to Gravesworld and threaten my y1. I could just move the y1 to my home, but that makes the game longer than necessary. If I attacked your g1, then you could also move in the g2 and I'd have the same problem, but more so since, if I attacked the g2 as well, I'd be out of red and you could walk all over me.
 
Anyway, I think I shortened the game by a move or two by picking a different ship to terraform.

53) Babamots: Move B1 Risa Zakdorn

54) ajo: Pass

55) Babamots: Move B2 Risa Zakdorn

56) ajo: Move G1 Ajo Zakdorn

	Babamots: I was planning this phase for a long time. Back when you had a large green, if you'd kept me from getting a second red, I think you could have stalled forever.
