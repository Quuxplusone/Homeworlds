	MikeYarrum: Your game. I figured you wouldn't mind, since we've got a few others going.
	zoltar: That's cool.  I didn't see the winning move at first, and then when I realized that your R3 was 'pinned' and thus just like not having any red pieces at all, I saw that I could simply win all three blue ships the next move and you could do nothing to stop me!
	MikeYarrum: I really should have moved another ship to my homeworld, but I kept putting it off with the idea that I had to utilize every move.
