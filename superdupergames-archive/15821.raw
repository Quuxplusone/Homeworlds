	dlwillson: Sorry that took so long!  I'm on customer site.
	dlwillson: The rules, to review, are: 2 teams of 2.  Me and Tripp versus Davey and Adam.  The game is over as soon as one player falls.
	dlwillson: Now, hurry up you guys!  :-)

6) johannz: Build G1 Johannz
	dlwillson: Umm...  I thought we were going to choose same size homeworlds for teams?
	dlwillson: Davey...  Weren't we going to have same size homeworlds for teams, so that you are closer to your team-mate, and more easily able to contribute ships and aid?
	dlwillson: Is this thing on?
	johannz: I actually am cool with him taking a different size. This way, you guys have to choose who to go after. You'll leave home to system 2, then you have to either go to a system 3 to attack me, or a system 1 to attack him. Either way, your intentions are clear.
	dlwillson: Hummm...  I'm not sure I'm OK with giving you guys an advantage, either!  But we'll go on with what we have and if Tripp and I lose, I can blame it on this...  :-D

	johannz: Cool. Same effect on SilentTitan, and all it cost was downgrading a G3 to a G2 ship instead of losing a g3.

	dethdukk: probably should have sacced a g2 to cat instead of the g3.  my mistake, I meant to advise you of that earlier.  the way you did it leaves them open to grab all the g3 stuff. simple mistake tho, I have done it a couple times.
