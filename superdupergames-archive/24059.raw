	wil: ya let me even up the game...

33) wil: Trade G3 Y3 Wil
	Marmalade: Yep. This is my second game of Homeworlds - I've wanted to play forever, but never gotten around to it :)
	wil: well you are doing quite well then I've been playing a couple of months..but a lot of games...it is a great game with a steep learning curve...lose a lot...learn a lot...

34) Marmalade: Trade G3 R3 Marmalade
	wil: simple hints...always get a gun when they have a gun (r) in general, make sure you get whatever they get (r, y, b) don't get skunked in any economy.  and WATCHOUT whenver they trade for a Y2 or Y3...

35) wil: Sacrifice G3 Wil
Build G1 Wil
Build G3 Wil
Build R1 Dryden
	wil: do you have the piece at home?  Often best to set them up, so you can follow the play and arrange the star systems in a fashion easier to see than this.
	Marmalade: Cheers - clearly the Y3 was to threaten catastrophe in my home system (emptying out y1, probably). so trading for the R3 was just defence.
 
First game I lost because my mind blanked regarding sacrificing red ships - just didn't occur to me.
 

	Marmalade: I've ordered my pyramids - should be turning up in a couple of weeks.
	wil: oops....tight squeeze now...you made the move to stop checkmate...but now have no power to build new ships..
	Marmalade: Yeah, but desperation really, I could have moved the G3 away I suppose - but this seemed more sensible.

38) Marmalade: Sacrifice R3 Dryden
Attack R1N Marmalade
Attack R1N Marmalade
Attack G1N Marmalade
	Marmalade: Yeah, just moving in a G2 ship would have done it, or sacrificing a G1 to build another red in dryden (and a catastrophe)
	wil: can't move or build..the only thing you can do is trade or attack....either way I  grow another red ship and catastrophe red in your system.....yes your doom is inevitable....but I did make a mistake you could prolong...

39) wil: Trade G2 R2 Wil
	Marmalade: Still going to suffer from a lack of large ships though.
	wil: I'll be glad to play again, and discuss what I've learned...
	wil: I'll be glad to play again, and discuss what I've learned...
	wil: oops...nice play...that I didn't see??
	wil: I may have just gave you the game back, maybe I can learn from you!

	wil: I was thinking after the our second debacle, I should just sit back and accumulate a large force of ships..with my factory abilities.....but then said...no I think I can put an end to his misery rather than drag this out....it appears i made yet another mistake in this regard....
	Marmalade: If there's a mistake here, I'm not seeing it.


61) wil: Attack R1 Wil
	wil: Oh I think I've finally got you tied up now....but prior I should have just been building large ships of all varieties instead of trying to end it...

62) Marmalade: Trade Y1 G1 Marmalade
	wil: no use leaving any of your crew alive to repopulate....but thanks for the ship.  That is  a great theory of homeworlds...ships are monsterous undertakings to build, major capital investment...why would one ever destroy a ship of anothers vs just taking it?  And you only sac your own when it provides a dramatic advantage...
	Marmalade: To be honest, you could have ended it a while ago - any time you had moved a size 2 ship into my homeworld, you could have sacrificed your 2 red ship at home to capture mine.

63) wil: Sacrifice R1 Wil
Attack G1 Marmalade
	wil: I only wish I had played that well my second game...
	Marmalade: Cheers :)
 
Good game. I'll run over the pgn's I think, try and work out where I went badly wrong.
 
If you do want another game, give me a shout.
	wil: up for a challenge any time....2nd time playing you played real well...if at my games you'll see I've played a lot and lost a lot....every time I see different things come at me I learn something....but there is a lot involved....   whenever you are ready challenge me again... you play fairly regular when youget online (this needs that feature, so you  know when someone else is willing to sit for a couple hours and play)  Sometimes, you can get a few moves in a day, sometimes each move takes a few days!!
