	pigasuspig: more of a cheap shot cuz I wondered how to outfox it. Of course, I see the answer now.

10) MatrixFrog: Build Y1 Matrixfrog
	pigasuspig: But maybe there's something to it, since it puts me closer to my target than to my enemy. I suppose we'll all find out. But the red starting ship, that was not really a good idea at all.
