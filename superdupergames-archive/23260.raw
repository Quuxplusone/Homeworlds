	Aristos: If you build yellow, I could sacrifice my Y2, move my Y1 into your home system and catastrophe. It would be your turn, and we would be *exactly* where we were on the second move of the game. Another player and I found a mini loop where either player breaking the loop lost the game. I wonder if, under optimal play, a larger "must maintain the loop" scenario exists...?
	Danner: Sorry for the delay, I'm in the middle of my exam period.
"Another player and I found a mini loop where either player breaking the loop lost the game." So we were right, cool! :) But it's also a problem, since draws are not implemented here. Do you want to use some kind of anti-loop rule in our games?

11) Aristos: Sacrifice Y1 Pretty
Discover Y1 Aristos B1 Fancy
	Aristos: Yes, I'd like such a rule. I've given some thought to this... I think that the player who owns the biggest ship involved in the loop should be the one that gets to "win" the loop. If both players tie for that, then ban the move that would take us back to an earlier game position. 
	Aristos: "Involved in the loop" means any ship that changes position/color/existence between during the turns from the first state of the loop until back to that state again.

12) Danner: Build G1 Danner
	Danner: I think it's a little over-complicated. :) It's easier to ban any move that would take us back to an earlier game position.
I've found a scenario where your rule is ambiguous.

Explanation:
First, the game progresses normally: A B C D E.
Then Red creates a loop. Assuming that Blue wins the loop, Red has to break it somewhere. He chooses C, and moves into position F.
Now Blue tries to move into position A. There are multiple loops to be considered: ABCFA and ABCDEBCFA.
It's possible that one of the loops produces a tie (the move is banned) and the other does not (the move is allowed).

13) Aristos: Trade Y1 G1 Fancy
	Aristos: Ok... I can agree to that rule... no going back to an earlier state.
