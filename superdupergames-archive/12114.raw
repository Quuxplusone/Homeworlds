	MadWuher: Just a few quick comments (in case it helps you in your next game). In the first few turns I was able to get control of the Blue tech (I did this because I saw a lot of B1's already being used on the table). If you had switched from producing Green tech to Blue tech, you would have forced me to abandon my control over Blue and I would have had to trade over to yellow or red right away. A bit part of this game is to control the colours (or at least force your opponents into doing something that will help you). 
	MadWuher: There was one turn where you sacrificed your Green 3 to create two Green 2's and a Green 3. This left a Green 3 open for me to take. Then you traded some Green tech and rebuilt your Green tech, letting me use the green production strategy against you. You did all the work, but I got to use it. I've seen others try to do similar work, but instead sacrifice their G3 when they control another colour, letting them get to other 3 pointers (then trading them back for the G3) and not letting your opponents have a production centre.
	MadWuher: Later in the game, I was able to control most of the Yellow tech (leaving you with only size 1 and/or 2 Yellow). This seemed to cause some trouble for you as you then had to navigate a little more carefully to get the catastrophe in my home system. Knowing that you didn't have either Blue tech ready to destroy my other star, or that you would use up most of your Red tech to destroy one of my stars, I chose to keep my Red tech out of the way and force a fight in your home system. Since I had a Red 3 to sacrifice and you had at most an R1 to fight back, I chose to overwhelm you in your home system with two size 3 ships (different colours in case you tried to make a catastrophe at your home planet). 
	MadWuher: I would recommend using your small ships to create catastrophes, only using your big ships if a catastrophe would allow you to destroy more points of ships on my side than on yours. The player TwoShort likes to think around two moves ahead, destroying ships if he will be in a better position (pointwise and/or endgame I think) within the next 2 turns. Also, TwoShort does a great job controlling the size 3 pyramids, and the colours. If you get a chance, you might want to check out some of his games to see how he does it. He has a few unorthodox starts and does similar steps in the first few turns, which, if you don't keep aware of, will hurt you later on in the game. 
	MrMoto: I- I thought I was winning! Hm, I have a lot to learn. Thanks for all your advice; it helps to see where I went wrong.
	MadWuher: Up to another? I played 3 games at the same time once to try different starts and different moves. If you select my "Hard Time, Unrated" challenge we can play without effecting ratings and if one of us times out, it will resign us from the game.
