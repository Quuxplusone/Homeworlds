GreedyAlgorithm: What is correct etiquette at SDG, to resign like chess or play to the end like Warcraft?
clockwise: I'm not entirely sure, this is only my third game on SDG. In my game against Zoltar (who has been around awhile) he resigned quite early in the endgame.
clockwise: My own feeling is that Homeworlds is very unforgiving of mistakes so playing to the end is pretty reasonable.
clockwise: Thanks for the game, I thought you had me for a while there!
GreedyAlgorithm: Yeah, I'm not sure how I missed the blue catastrophe. But it is _very_ unforgiving. :)
GreedyAlgorithm: Good game!
