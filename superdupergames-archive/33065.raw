1) dlwillson: H Y3 B2 G3
	dlwillson: Well hello! Long time, no see! :-)

2) Felix: Homeworld R1 B3 G3
	Felix: Hahaha, that timing worked out well. Congrats on hitting the top again! You've been playing really well lately; but I am to change that ;) Have fun.
	Felix: aim to*

3) dlwillson: B G1 Dlwillson
	Felix: You took my fortress... sad day! I'm so used to playing fortress now, I'm not always sure what to do with myself as a Goldilocks. I briefly debated playing a 1-1... but I don't want to be that obnoxious in a ladder game :P
	dlwillson: I wouldn't have minded. It's just a game. The greatest game in the world! Of Off all time! But still, just a game. :-)
	dlwillson: s/Of Off/Of/

4) Felix: Build G1 Felix

5) dlwillson: Trade G1 R1 Dlwillson
	Felix: Good to know for next time! And agreed. The best game in the UNIVERSE! Wishing it would catch on more.

6) Felix: Trade G1 R1 Felix

7) dlwillson: Build R2 Dlwillson

8) Felix: Build R2 Felix
	wil: (apologizing in advance for the intrusion)  
In plotting how to make homeworlds as ubiquitous as chess... Can we come up with a better way than kidnapping the top chess players of each metropolitan area and locking them in a room with a bunch of pyramids?
	dlwillson: I like that idea! :-)

9) dlwillson: B R2 Dlwillson
	Felix: I'm in favor ;)
	dlwillson: More seriously, a live tournament with an entry fee and prizes would be fun, and I think it might make people curious. I also keep thinking that it's time for Looney Labs to make a Homeworlds box set.

10) Felix: Trade R2 Y2 Felix

11) dlwillson: Discover R1 Dlwillson Y1 Golden
	dlwillson: I just checked and tight-timings are possible in SDG. I put up a challenge of 1h/1h/1 as a test. It seems to have worked. I'm thinking that it should be 1/1h/1, though.

12) Felix: Discover R1 Felix G2 Forstep
	Felix: Interesting! I wonder if you could do something even tighter in theory? 5 minutes each side, with a maximum of 10? If you had your opponent on a skype or phone call, it could move very quickly.

13) dlwillson: Discover R1 Golden B2 Sky

14) Felix: Build Y1 Felix

15) dlwillson: D R2 Dlwillson B1 Sea
	dlwillson: We should try it. Try m for minute, and challenge me.

16) Felix: Move Y1 Felix Forstep
	Felix: Done. I'm at work though, so I don't think I'll be able to play it out.
	Felix: No good. Looks like it doesn't take minutes, only hours, per this documentation: http://superdupergames.wikidot.com/howto:clocks
	dlwillson: Oh! It takes 0 as an increment!

17) dlwillson: Build G1 Dlwillson
	Felix: So the best you could do would be to set one hour for the game, and have a 0 increment?

18) Felix: Sacrifice G3 Felix
Build R2 Forstep
Build R3 Forstep
Build Y1 Forstep

19) dlwillson: Sacrifice G3 Dlwillson
Build R3 Sea
Build R3 Dlwillson
Build G1 Dlwillson
	dlwillson: Yes. That would be perfect, I think.
	Felix: We'll have to schedule one sometime! My schedule is pretty packed now though. Hard to set aside a solid hour for game time with a puppy, a baby, and two jobs :P

20) Felix: Move R3 Forstep Felix

21) dlwillson: Move G1 Dlwillson Sea
	dlwillson: Your burst was excellently surprising!
	dlwillson: Let's try that fast game. If it works, we can recommend it to Bamabots for the next tournament.

22) Felix: D R2 Forstep Y1 Ichor
	Felix: It was probably a dumb move, in retrospect. But it's nice to be unpredictable :) And yes, I'll let you know when we can try that.

	Felix: Thank you! I've had a losing streak for a while, so I hope I can break that. And I know the feeling... The last time I was on top, I played very poorly and lost my first game. Not that you're playing poorly! I just hope I'm playing better ;)

	Felix: There. That's slightly smarter, I think.
	dlwillson: "Darn! That's the end!" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT6cxlW6ym8
	dlwillson: Good game! Excellently played!
	Felix: Thank you! Likewise. I'm sure my reign of terror will be brought to an end by you or Wil before long :P
	dlwillson: Ah, absolutely! >;-)
