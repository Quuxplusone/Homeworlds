	MatrixFrog: Okay... maybe one or two more days, then that's it.
	rootbeer: It looks to me as if it's too easy for a new player to sign up for a game without realizing what they're doing. If they're new and not invested in the site, they just don't bother coming back.
	rootbeer: It's been five days since mtgrocks04 has been seen on the site.

	MatrixFrog: True.
