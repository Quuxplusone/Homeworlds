	Laurie_Menke: Hi everyone... I just wanted to let you know that I'm making a list of games to ask Aaron to end due to abandonment.  I know you are all fairly currently active on SDG, but this game seems abandoned, so I am going to include it on the list unless one of you says not to in the next 24 hours.  I hope that's the right thing to do.  :)
	dragonlord: Please don't add this to the list of abandoned games.
	Draw5PlayAll: Yeah, we can just boot the one player and continue.
	Draw5PlayAll: So that explains how come I got about 10 monitored Homeworlds game with a new chat message.
