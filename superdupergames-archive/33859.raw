	wil: I got a local kid addicted to the game...was able to play 2/3 times a week or more, 3/4 games a night!  He moved away.  So if you run into Trydnt on here...he just started at the bottom of the ladder.

8) wil: Build Y2 Wil
	Felix: I have already played several games against him, actually!

	Draw5PlayAll: Aw, come on... that ladder is hard ENOUGH already! I got kicked from #1 within a few weeks of getting there!
	wil: The hardest thing about the ladder is getting thru the dead wood at the bottom.  Who cares about the top...the object is to play the people who are near the top....while I won't deny I enjoy winning...I like playing...and learning from my losses.
