	Felix: I want so badly to sacrifice my g3 for a bunch of yellows, but then you could just catastrophe them!
	orangeblood: Do you mean because you could grab two large ones in the process?

14) Felix: Move G1 Felix Point
	Felix: I wouldn't really gain anything. I'd just end up trading my g3 for a y3, basically.

	orangeblood: It was my intention to try the "banker" strategy in this game. Do you have any tips on how to actually get to the point where I could even try it? haha...
	Felix: I'm not so good at that strategy myself. Basically you just want to move g1s or g2s out to large stars that you want to keep away from me, but you can't really cash those in until that color is down to only larges. So if you moved a g1 to a y3, for instance, then if all the y1s and y2s were depleted you could sac that g1 to build the y3 (but only if you had a yellow ship elsewhere where you could build it.) It's not an easy strategy and sometimes requires more effort than it's worth, in my opinion.

48) Felix: Build Y1 Antares

49) orangeblood: Build R1 Orangeblood
