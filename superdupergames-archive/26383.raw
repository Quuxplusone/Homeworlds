	wil: the rule for me there was...you have a yellow, I should have a the capability to create more yellow as well... and since there was only one small one left, I better get it now before you corner the market on fuel to move about the universe...

Attack Y3 Glutnix
	wil: yes you did,  you changed my whole universe!

	wil: risky behavior me leaving and attacking like that, but it appeared I would stay one step ahead...so I proceeded...
	wil: keep playin, keep challenging, this is a great game...  any questions...ask.
	wil: If you look at my record I've played a lot of homeworlds....and one just over half of them...the first 20 I probably lost...but each time watched different strategies come at me, and eventually learned them.  I like the way this game plays, I've always liked chess and actually prefer it over chess now...   I hope you continue playing it and enjoy it as much as I.
