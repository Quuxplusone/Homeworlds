6) TeeTeeTee: Trade G1 Y1 Teeteetee
	TeeTeeTee: I was treating TwoShort's time-out as if it was a resignation: I'd taken the lead very early on in the game, and would have been very surprised if TwoShort had found a way to catch up after my last move.

	TeeTeeTee: I'm in the lead again, yes, but it'd be quite easy for me to lose that advantage if I'm careless here. Can you see why did that last move, by the way?

	wil: If I had any sense I'd resigned move 7

31) wil: Move G2 Wil Y3
	TeeTeeTee: Hmm. It would have been a stronger move for me to build another y3 on my last move, rather than move that y3 to your world g3 - guess I was being impatient...

32) TeeTeeTee: Build B2 G3
	wil: I just tried to take a little of your clout away and prolong the agony.

Catastrophe Wil Red

	TeeTeeTee: A more stalling move for you would have been "trade b1 y3 r1".
	wil: ah...   I stalled long enough...   I played pittifully....I'll give it a few days for someone else to challenge you before I try again...thanx
	TeeTeeTee: Hmmm... I don't think you played 'pitifully'. You made a catastrophic mistake at the start, but after that, I don't think there was much else you could have done better - you were only playing on in the hope that I'd slip up somewhere from that point - and you put up quite a strong defence. TwoShort made the same catastrophic error right at the start of the last game that I played, too.
 
At the beginning of the game, when there's a choice of two colours with two small pyramids in the stash - yellow and blue in this case, and red and blue in the game with TwoShort - it's surely better to choose the colour with fewer medium pyramids in the stash. I was able to very quickly cut off all access to yellows in this game, and then stake out the large blues as stars, which made your monopoly on blue not very useful. A similar thing happened in the last game I played: TwoShort had a monopoly on blue, but couldn't use that to any effect as I was able to repeatedly attack their worlds with impunity due to my red monopoly.
 
I'd like to wait for a bit to see if there are any other ladder challengers, as we have played quite a lot of games recently. Thanks for the game!
	wil: yeah...a pitiful catastrophic mistake...which by all rights in a 'championship' game should have caused an immediate resignation on my part.  but yeah...I am gone till early week...and I'll be glad to let a challenger slip in...  

	wil: thank you for the game.
	wil: appears I must challenge two short now...again tho...I'll wait till next week in case he wishes to challenge you.
