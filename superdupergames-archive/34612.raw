29) DodoBirb: Build G1 Dodobirb
	DodoBirb: I definitely screwed up the opening a little bit. When I started building blue I should have kept going but instead I switched to Red when you started building that. Now you have 3 large ships over my 2 because I took 2 turns trading.

	DodoBirb: gg
	DodoBirb: Well played.
	Babamots: gg! And thanks for being in the tournament! Good luck on your games!
	Draw5PlayAll: Bolarus?
	Babamots: Bolarus IX is the homeworld of Bolians in Star Trek.
	Draw5PlayAll: Bolians? (No spoilers)
	Babamots: Bolians are a blue-skinned, usually-bald humanoid race. If there's a Starfleet officer in the background who isn't a human, they're usually Bolian. It seems to me that they appear in situations where the show makers wanted to display a little species diversity but not work at it too hard. The most notable individual Bolian I can think of is Mr. Mot, who is a barber on the Enterprise D.
	Draw5PlayAll: Wait so are the Andorians and Bolians both blue skinned?!
	Babamots: Andoeians typically have blue skin, though there have been some blueish ones.
	Draw5PlayAll: What?
	Babamots: I was confirming what you said: Andorians and Bolians have blue skin.
 
It was barely worth mentioning, but I was also saying that that there are a few exceptions: a few Andorians in Star Trek looked more greenish than blue.
	Babamots: Sorry, I just reread and saw that I said just said some Andorians are "blueish." I must have been interrupted while typing. I mean to say "blueish green."
