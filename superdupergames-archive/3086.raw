jeep: OK, so here's what I'd love to see from some of you homeworlds experts... an article on the wiki explaining, in general, what kinds of things you try to do in these situations: 1) you have more big ships (esp if your opp has more ships) 2) you have more ships (esp if your opp has more big ships) I think I may have squandered a lead in my game vs. TwoShort where I had a huge lead in big ships. Now I still have more big ships, but he has a gigantic fleet!
Jesse: Having more ships gives you more influence to control the economy. Having more large ships gives you more power to seize and control systems and ships.

Jesse: Okay, here's how I see this playing out. The only place you can approach me is from your homeworld to mine, and only one ship at a time. If you send green ships, I'll take them one by one, and it doesn't matter much if you cause a catastrophe. (In fact, it benefits me.) If you send red ships, I capture them one by one. If necessary, I will sacrifice a red ship when doing so, to ensure that you can never cause a red catastrophe. You have no yellow ships, so as long as I don't trade or sacrifice yellow, that's no worry. If you send a blue ship, I capture it. If you create another, I can move a blue ship out of my system to ensure you can't cause a catastrophe. You cannot affort to have two blue ships in your home system at the same time, or I sac a y2 to blast your blue marker. You don't have time to snatch that yellow piece and make use of it, because it only takes two turns to sac my y3s and put 3 yellow ships in your home system. So, I'm safe.
Jesse: That just leaves the question of how to win, without giving up that position. First of all, I need enough blues to destroy your blue marker. That's easy. Second, I need to position my ships so I can hit you with a bunch of yellow and a bunch of blue in quick succession. The easiest launch point is my own homeworld, since I know it to be safe. I can't build up blues there, so I'll have to send them in two waves from farther out. That means I should mass my smaller yellows there, while moving the y3s out to my large systems. I can turn Storage into a ship, then sac it and my other two y3s to blast you in three waves.
Jesse: I do need to exercise some caution that you can't grab the first y3 and smash me in one blow after my second wave, but I believe that's covered by you not being able to put three blues all one step from my homeworld.
jeep: Nod, it's looked futile to me for a while. I'm interested in seeing this end game though.

jeep: I thought I had a small blue at Hana... I don't think there was anything to do anyway.
Jesse: Indeed. Thanks for the game. I hope seeing the endgame played out was helpful to you.
jeep: It was, actually. Thanks for being patient with me. ;)
Jesse: No problem at all. It actually helped remind me of some things to pay attention to in homeworld assaults. (I usually go for the ships, rather than the system.)
