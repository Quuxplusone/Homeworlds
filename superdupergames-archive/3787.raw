28) TwoShort: Build B2 Twoshort
TwoShort: Hmm, sometimes my comments seem to get dropped... I had said a few moves back that after you beat me with the All-out-Factory-push, and thus cemented my beleif that it is the optimal strategy, I went for something completely different this game. Not sure what I was thinking...

30) TwoShort: Discover B2 Twoshort B2 Oyoy
zoltar: My comments get dropped if I try to send them at the same time I am sending a move. My thinking was along chess lines, that it is better to develop more pieces than move the same piece again in the opening, so I ignored your chasing me around moving your red ship over and over, and then somehow I simply won it outright.

31) zoltar: Move G3 Birch Yoyo
zoltar: I'm going to wait and come back to this after dinner..
TwoShort: The idea was to get in there fast and prevent you from getting the factory going, so you couldn't monopolize green. Obviously, it worked brilliantly :)

32) TwoShort: Build B3 Twoshort
zoltar: Ok, I'll still do my original move. I was in a hurry and didn't want to blow my lead with some silly blunder, but this looks safe enough. The Factory rules! Except -- I want that last g3!

33) zoltar: Move Y3 Birch Oyoy
TwoShort: You'll have to come and get it. (Not that it looks like that will present much difficulty...)
TwoShort: Hmmm, if this is "after dinner" are you on the east coast?
zoltar: Affirmative. I live in Greenbelt, Milky Way

34) TwoShort: Sacrifice Y3 Twoshort

Catastrophe Twoshort B

42) TwoShort: Build R1 Twoshort
zoltar: Ok, I will violate cardinal rule number one and get rid of my only 3-pip ship in my homeworld, as it'll take you at least two turns to trade for a y3 and then do something annoying.

zoltar: The Death Star is almost in position...
zoltar: Wait a second!
zoltar: The Death Star is Fully Functional! Ass stations, fire on the Rebel Base!!!
zoltar: That was supposed to be, "All Stations, fire on the Rebel Base!" :) I suddenly remembered that our homeworlds were connected after blowing your b3 star!
