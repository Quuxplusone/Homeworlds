4) Laurie_Menke: Build Y1 Laurie_menke

5) DodoBirb: Trade G1 B1 Dodobirb

	DodoBirb: Sorry, I probably should have paused the time. We can have a rematch if you want.
	Laurie_Menke: I'm the one that's sorry, DodoBirb. I've been traveling and having trouble keeping up with games. I probably shouldn't have joined the tournament in the first place. But I am sure you would have won eventually and am happy to conceded if you'd like. If that doesn't feel good for you, I'm also happy to try again. In any case, thanks for the fun!
	DodoBirb: I'm fine with taking it if you're having trouble keeping up with the games. Hope you've had fun!
	Laurie_Menke: I have indeed! Thanks, DodoBirb!  :)
