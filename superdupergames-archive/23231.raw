	Aristos: Hey, TwoShort... have you ever seen anyone catastrophe one of the stars of their own homeworld in order to shorten the distance from one homeworld to the other? I thought about that idea the other day and was trying to figure out if it would ever be a useful strategy. Like in this game, if I blew my giant star, I would then be able to step directly to your homeworld. I'd have to have a giant fleet ready to move. Ever see anything like that?

15) Aristos: Build Y1 Aristos
	TwoShort: I've never seen it, but I've considered the option...  i.e. I've noticed that I could do it if my opponent made a move they ultimately didn't; and I've wanted to win a game that way, just for the cool points :)  BTW, nice move with the catastrophe, I feel dumb I missed it.
	Aristos: Thanks.

	Aristos: I don't see any way for you to ever get any yellow tech or any size 2 ships as long as I don't leave any size 1 yellows in the bank.
	TwoShort: OK, you've had me from the catastrophe and I've just been waiting to see if you'd screw it up, but you won't :(  Good game.
	Aristos: Thanks.
