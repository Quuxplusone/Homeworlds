5) dsabremaster: Discover B1 Dsabremaster G2 Gamma 37

20) wil: Build G3 Wil

	wil: that was the old, you can have one I get three swap.  it also works with the you get two I get three deal or even 1/2...  not beneficial to have your big red in the homeworld where it can't be utilized...  but I'm afraid in this game I gotcha way early, and then used my factory extensively...building a factory is a powerful tool, it is only safe to not have one when the opponent can't get one...
	wil: I thank you for the game...  I like to play, and don't wish to be obnoxious, so feel free to challenge me to as many or few games as you'd like.  It is all about the learning and sharing..
	dsabremaster: Yeah, it's been a while since I've played, and I'm not quite back in the mindset to anticipate those things again yet. I'd like to try again, although I think I'd change my opening setup slightly and go for a Banker instead of a Goldilocks. Not sure if that's enough to deal with what you started with (which I think is one of the most solid starts in the game), but I'd be interestd to try.

	wil: Yeah, I'd love it if we had a program which could say....let us back up to that mistake, or turning point and try it differently...that would be a dream (oh and the live action app where you could watch the other person move and you just slid the pyramids with your fingers on your smart phone...
