	jeep: I've finally decided that I'm a Builder.  I was trying to play the Traveller game, since I saw you were playing builder, but I never do as well when I try it.
	TwoShort: I'm certainly more comfortable with Builder, though I've been switching back and forth since others seem convinced Traveller is superior.  I just love the Factory though.

12) jeep: Build Y2 Jeep
	jeep: *sigh*  I need to start using notes!!   I took so long because I was trying to work around that... considered making a Red in my homeworld.

	TwoShort: Well, fooey.  Here I was gloating to myself about how clever I was to not call the catastrophe yet, and inconvenience you one tiny bit more, and completely overlooking my doom.

19) TwoShort: Sacrifice G3 Yolonda
Build G1 Twoshort
Build G2 Twoshort
Build G2 Twoshort
	jeep: Yeah, I almsot missed it myself.  And had I called catastrophe, you could have just built more ships, maybe enough that my one attack couldn't cripple you.
	TwoShort: But then or now, being able to grow has a fatal flaw...

20) jeep: Move G3 Twoshort Giant
