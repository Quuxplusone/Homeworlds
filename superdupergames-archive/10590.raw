	wmshub: I see no way out for me! You can keep capturing my ships, I can only build red, eventually there will be a catastrophe and all my ships will be gone...
	MatrixFrog: Right, but you can trade one of your reds for another color. I probably have this game, but just in case, your best bet is probably to switch to yellow, and get to my homeworld asap.
