	wil: newbie....learning game....abuse at wil, I figure I'll learn by getting beat until I see the moves coming at me...

3) wil: Build G1 Wil
	SilentTitan: good plan... Hint... think of the colors as technologies.  green=build, red=attack, blue=trade, yellow=move.  don't forget about sacrifice and catastrophe those are the ones that newbies get hung up on. 
 
Good Luck. 
	wil: Yeah, I think I have those 4 of one color, and sac = pips of that action, and factory... and in my mind I'm looking at the star systems as mega corporations, the green as venture captialists supporting new business and bolstering old businesses...Red is Vulture Capitalists, take over/acquisition specialists, yellow is HR, in house headhunters, Blue is stock brokers....
 
I look forward to learning from my loss.

4) SilentTitan: Build G1 Silenttitan

5) wil: Trade G1 Y1 Wil

8) SilentTitan: Build G1 Silenttitan
	wil: Do you know of anyone who has written more on the strategy of this game?  Opening gambits, mid game strategy plays (I've seen factory, bluebird, catastrohe) end game...but like when not to catastophe or how to set someone else up by enticing them to catastrophe or such?

9) wil: Trade G1 B1 Wil

10) SilentTitan: Trade G3 B3 Silenttitan

11) wil: Build G1 Wil

12) SilentTitan: Build G1 Silenttitan
	SilentTitan: those are interesting questions... catastrophe are pretty much straight forward.  I was able one time to build two battleships in a system and entice my opponent to take those and thereby he missed protecting against a sac of a Y3 and a cat for the win in his home world, but it was a truly desperation move and I could not believed it worked. 
	SilentTitan: I've learned most of the stuff I do from losing to TwoShort or nmeme.

26) SilentTitan: Sacrifice Y1 Silenttitan
Move B3 Sol Fortcourage
	wil: That was a complete bonehead move on my part....I meant to move a red ship forward....so if you took that I'd get a 3....but then I thought...I can keep him from getting the other one by using the red star....and now I get nothing but anihilated....
 
hopefully a lesson learned...whilst you are over there chuckling at my stupidity.


27) wil: Move B1 Fortcourage Wil
	SilentTitan: I've read your post three times and I'm still a bit confused as to exactly what you are talking about ..... I cannot build the R3 as I already have 3 reds in the only system I could build it in, and a fourth would invite a catastrophe.  I have to move and that will allow you to build out to a red 3 world.
	wil: no you can't now....and again, I am just learning the system...but it appears to me in all likelihood you will be capable of building it before I....again newbie trying to make sense of it all.
	wil: oh and yes I see how awful my original plan was which I mistakenly thwarted...if moved up and captured my ship you'd then easily be able to catastrophe me!  arrrggghh
	SilentTitan: Then you will be able to sac the g2 and build that R3 as a ship at your leisure. I'd like to prevent that from happening .. but I'm not sure I can .. you are playing very well so far.

	SilentTitan: ok... now in this case what happened here is that you had three reds in taratup two ships in a red system.  All I had to do was add a fourth red to the system and call for a catastrophe.  This destroyed the entire system and all the ships in it.  I sacrificed my y2 to give me the two moves I needed to get the r1 from forttortuga to taratupa via the sol system.  Did this make sense?
	SilentTitan: sorry to be clearer you had two RED ships in a RED system,  1-pip red and a two-pip red 
	wil: yeah...i didn't notice this was close enough....to bad the system doesn't allow for instant replay so I can go back and watch it happen and see what i missed...thanx for the flogging!

	wil: yeah...i didn't notice this was close enough....to bad the system doesn't allow for instant replay so I can go back and watch it happen and see what i missed...thanx for the flogging!

	wil: As I see it, I've now got zero greens...can't trade for them....your goal will be to keep me locked out of them and I can't even prolong the end?
