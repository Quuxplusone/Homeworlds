15) zoltar: Build Y2 Nix
	fnord: Sorry, but was too tempting to pass up.
	zoltar: I never even saw that coming.  I'm still bad at sacrifices, though it's easier for me to see my own possible sacs but I miss opponents' ones.  I think the game is pretty much over


16) fnord: Trade G1 R1 Fnord
	fnord: I don't know, you seemed to have used sacrifices well against me.  I didn't see some of the ones coming that you used against me, though I know I was forced to make moves that wouldn't let you use others.
	fnord: And I wouldn't say the game is over, I still have a long way to go.

17) zoltar: Build Y2 Nix

18) fnord: Build G1 Fnord
	zoltar: Ok, I won't resign and will play it out -- I doubt I can last more than a few moves.

19) zoltar: Discover Y2 Nix Y2 Hydra

20) fnord: Trade G3 Y3 Fnord
	fnord: Interesting defence... deny me Yellow ships, so I can't cause a catastrophe in your system.  Very ingenious.

21) zoltar: Build Y3 Nix

22) fnord: Sacrifice Y3 Fnord
Discover R1 Fnord B1 Discordia
Move R1 Discordia Nix
Move R1 Nix Zoltar

	zoltar: YIKES!
	fnord: Foo!  Hadn't thought of that... thought I had you there.

25) zoltar: Trade Y3 R3 Zoltar

26) fnord: Discover R1 Zoltar G3 Route

27) zoltar: Build Y3 Nix

28) fnord: Trade G1 R1 Fnord

29) zoltar: Move Y3 Nix Zoltar
	zoltar: I'm still not quite out of the hole, but seeing that I could defend, your sac nullified your advantage, and a slow build up instead would have kept you in the lead, as it would be longer for me to get green ships again.

30) fnord: Build G1 Fnord

31) zoltar: Trade Y3 G3 Zoltar
	zoltar: Now I'm threatening to sac my Y3 and move my big gun into your homeworld!!!  What a turn of events!
	fnord: Possibly.  I was likely blinded by not wanting to risk building up slowly and letting you pull something out of your hat like you've done before, so I tried for the quick kill.

32) fnord: Build R1 Route
	zoltar: Well, I'm going to learn from your mistake and pass by a possible quick kill and strengthen my position.  I'm going to be away from my computer and will move again in an hour or so.

33) zoltar: Build Y3 Zoltar

34) fnord: Build R2 Route

35) zoltar: Move R3 Zoltar Route
Catastrophe Route R

36) fnord: Build R1 Fnord
	zoltar: Looks like a fair trade to me, leaving me with a monopoly on the wormhole technology...
	zoltar: My super-safe defensive build-up play is working better that I had imagined.

37) zoltar: Trade Y3 R3 Zoltar
	fnord: No, not exactly a monopoly...  I can get out of my system, I just can't go anywhere else.

38) fnord: Discover G1 Fnord G1 Kallisti

39) zoltar: Build G2 Zoltar
	fnord: Another lesson... make at least one of your homeworld stars a 1-point, so that you have a better chance of creating stars one step away from your homeworld in the mid-game.

40) fnord: Build G2 Fnord

41) zoltar: Build Y3 Zoltar

42) fnord: Discover G1 Fnord B1 Sink
	zoltar: Actually, I just learned today that the most preferable setup for the first player is a 1-point star and a 2-point star, with colors y & b (either combination) with a g3 ship, and then you have more control over the 3-point pieces later in the game when you create stars one-step from your homeworld. 

43) zoltar: Trade Y3 R3 Zoltar

44) fnord: Move R1 Fnord Sink
	fnord: seems good, though you've put Y3 ships to good use often enough.

45) zoltar: Build Y3 Zoltar

46) fnord: Build G2 Sink

47) zoltar: Build G3 Zoltar

48) fnord: Build R1 Fnord

Move R3 Nix Sink
Move R3 Zoltar Nix
	fnord: Yeah, couldn't figure out how to get that G3. *sigh*
And you were worried about being out of the game.  *chuckle*
	zoltar: Yes, your sac backfired terribly.  I notice that had your sac sent an R3 rather than a puny R1 into my homeworld, the game would be over.  Shows how important the big ships are.

50) fnord: Sacrifice G2 Sink
Build R2 Sink
Build R2 Sink
Catastrophe Sink R

51) zoltar: Trade G2 B2 Zoltar
	fnord: Yeah, but back then I couldn't have gotten an R3, and by the time I could have gotten to it, you would have had a 3 ship as well, most likely.  Well, it certainly was worth a try.

52) fnord: Build G2 Sink
	zoltar: Nice move!  That ruined my plans....

53) zoltar: Sacrifice G3 Zoltar

	fnord: Whoops... Just noticed I had 4 reds in my homeworld...  better move one.

68) fnord: Pass

69) zoltar: Move Y3 Hydra Kallisti
	zoltar: I saw that too, but simply passing and blowing them seemed pretty rude, so I just went ahead with my play to grab most of the pieces before I attack...
	zoltar: I just lost a game 1 minute ago to TwoShort with very few pieces on the board (just the two original homeworlds and 4 of his pieces left in the final position) -- I suppose the minimum possible would be to blow up your opps homeworld and have one piece left in your homeworld with only one star.  This is the opposite of that game in just about every way possible -- I wonder if I can win with every piece on the board, all owned by me!
