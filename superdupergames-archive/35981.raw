	nicknack: Well played with the blue monopoly. Thanks for the game! Hope to rematch soon.
	Trydnt: any monopoly makes for a pretty easy win tbh. you need to focus intently on not getting frozen out, which of course often leads to trading for whatever colors your opponent gets so they don't get a head start in that color's growth.
 
in the late game though the biggest lesson to be learned from monopolies is to make sure you don't expend so many resources blowing up half of your opponents star, that you leave yourself in a devastatingly weakened position in the new arrangement. So unless you have a way to blow up the other half too, it's usually best to hold off on pulling the trigger until you're ready.
 
or as I formulate it for the people I'm teaching at the moment - "If you go in with half a plan, you'll come out with half a victory"
	nicknack: Thank you! I look forward to trying again!
