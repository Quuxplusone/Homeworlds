MikeYarrum: I know this probably seems like a really short game, but I think I made way too many mistakes, and you're really far ahead. Mind if we start over?
TwoShort: I'd be happy to. For what it's worth, I believe it's mate in 3: Next turn I sacrifice my y3 at twoshort to move my other y3 and my r3 into your homeworld. You can only take one of them, so next I sac my r2 to take it back and your g3 as well. Finally I sac the r3 to take whatever is left. I'm pretty sure there's nothing you can do to derail that. I don't mean to gloat, it's just that I almost never can figure things out that far in advance, so if you're going to resign I had to at least tell you about it :)
MikeYarrum: No, I don't mind. =D Explaining how something is a mistake is the best way to learn.
