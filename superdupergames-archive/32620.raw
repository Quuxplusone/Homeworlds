	Babamots: I forgot I signed up for this game. I've never actually played sinister, so this should be fun! 
	Vezeon: sinister? lol
	Vezeon: I'm just trying to figure out how to play homeworlds online. I didn't realize this was a different variant until I saw 4 players.
	Babamots: Sinister means you're trying to eliminate the guy on your left. In your case, Vezeon, you win if *you* destroy me. If someone else kills me, no one wins yet, and the player to your left is then the South player.
	Vezeon: Oh sweet ok! I was reading the rules earlier and it was talking about good vs evil but I guess that's more of when you are playing tabletop
	Babamots: Yeah, this site doesn't support good vs evil rules.
	Vezeon: Makes sense. The honor system wouldn't work either lol
	Babamots: Actually, it wouldn't be hard to have the site randomly assign alignments to the players that only they could see. But I think most people are more interested in rules that don't involve chance.
	Vezeon: True, this is definitely a wonderful game that relies heavily on strategy and throwing in the chance factor is a bit iffy.
