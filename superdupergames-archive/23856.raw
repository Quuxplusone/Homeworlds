	Broccoli_Commander: Hi everybody!
So this is north&south vs east&west? i.e. OnePageWars with Leonard_Daniels against Marmalade and myself?
 
Good luck and have fun, and just so it is clear from the get-go: all your base are belong to us.
	Broccoli_Commander: Hey Marmalade, let's do the strategy you told me about this game! 
 
You know, the whole pyramids eye jamming thing...
	Marmalade: That was my understanding, woo.
 
Good luck guys.
	Marmalade: It was less of a strategy, and more of a compulsion. On the plus side, it has the advantage of surprise.
