	Danner: If you are interested, I can give you a link where Homeworlds strategies can be found, so you can regain your abilities. (In fact, I haven't read them due to lack of time, but I'm going to do so)
	Keith: I would like to have the link.  I have read what I could find on strategy.  The area i am primarily falling short in from being out of practice is not being able to see 4+ moves ahead anymore.

25) Danner: Move Y3 Earth Dimm
	Danner: http://www.icehousegames.org/wiki/index.php?title=Homeworlds_strategy
It's from MadWuher.

	Keith: Thanks for the link.  I am too far gone here.  By the way I evaluate material you have about a 3x material advantage and are about to make significant gains.
 
If I decide to reinvest in Homeworlds I will come looking for a rematch.
	Danner: Thanks for the game. You can challenge me anytime.
