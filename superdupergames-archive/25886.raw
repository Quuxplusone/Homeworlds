	wil: Well I am dominated...and BC just timed out to TTT...  it would be right of me to resign now so you could challenge first place...if you'd rather I did that than fight out this game...and I'll challenge you again when I reach a position to do so.

	TwoShort: As far as resigning or not, I'm not particularly concerned about jumping into the next game fast (I feel a little guilty for timing out my previous game, and I'm still pretty busy).  I'm pretty sure I'm going to win this one, but I still find it interesting to figure out how to turn an advantage into actual victory.  In the past I've gotten annoyed at people I thought quit too early, but I'm trying to adopt a more relaxed attitude :)  Don't feel like you should resign on my account; but also don't feel you need to keep playing a bad position if you're not having fun or you'd rather go on to the next game.
	wil: thanks for that, I enjoy the struggle and watching it play out...and so often in this game one can take advantabe of an opening that occurs and turn the tide instantly with a new universe (an error I  doubt you will present)  Yes it is intriguing how you can 'get ahead' significantly but still have to fight to put the pieces in place to end the game.
