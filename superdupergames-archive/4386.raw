	Papipo: This is my first game :S
	zoltar: Good luck! It's a very hard game to learn, I found out. I learned in June and it took me several games to understand all the tactics. The sacrifices are the most tricky and the hardest to get used to and anticipate. However, after a few games, this has become my favorite of all the games here, and I've gotten pretty good at it.

18) zoltar: Discover B1 Zoltar G1 Greenbelt
	Papipo: I think that you have an advantage atm
	zoltar: Not quite yet. The trick here is to try to make your opponent take the last of any size of one color, as there is always an advantage to having larger ships.  Here I haven't yet found a way to get an advantage and secure larger ships.

25) Papipo: Trade B3 G3 Papipo
	zoltar: Uh oh! Since it's your first game, I want to tell you to undo that move, as it's a classic beginner's mistake and would be just about the end of the game:
 
I can sacrifice my newly made Y2 in Greenbelt for 2 movements; I use the 2 movements to move my B1 from Greenbelt to Bluemoon to Papino, and I destroy your blue star and your 2 blue ships, which include your only large ship, leaving your homeworld half-destroyed and without a large defending ship.  At that point your game is pretty much lost. 
 
This is where things are tricky. I now have a slight advantage precisely because you can't build a blue ship here. So you need to either move a yellow ship out, or trade one of your ships to a different color. But always check before building a third of any color to see if your opponent can sacrifice any yellow pieces (Y3's are the most dangerous) to create a catastrophe.
	Papipo: Ahahah, i see, thanks

26) zoltar: Trade B3 G3 Zoltar
	zoltar: Because of that threat, I now can do a clever sacrifice to grab more of the blue pieces.
