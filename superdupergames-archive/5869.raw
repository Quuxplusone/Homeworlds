Catastrophe Uglyfoot Green
clockwise: So your mistake here was that you didn't recognize that my prior move was a double threat. With the primary threat being the annihilation of your homeworld and the secondary threat being a subsequent catastrophy in xchg. You saw and responded to the secondary threat, but did not see the primary threat.
clockwise: Always pay attention to your opponents large pieces and what they are capable of. Here the fact that my y3 gave me near instant access to your homeworld meant you should have played more defensively.
