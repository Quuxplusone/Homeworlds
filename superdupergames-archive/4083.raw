Started: 2006.8.22, Ended: 2006.9.8
Participants: Laurie_Menke (S), eugman (N)
Winner: Laurie_Menke

1) eugman: Homeworld B2 Y1 G3

2) Laurie_Menke: Homeworld Y1 B3 G3
eugman: Yeah I'm really new to homeworlds but apparently learning fast. I'm in a game with zoltar and in one with keith right now so I don't know if I'll be able to do any of the quick back and forth while that is the case.
Laurie_Menke: No problem. I'm usually only able to play in the evenings anyway. And although I've played a fair amount of games of Homeworlds, I'm still pretty rotten at it. ;o)

3) eugman: Build G1 Eugman

4) Laurie_Menke: Build G1 Laurie_menke
eugman: From playing playing against zoltar I've figured out that in order to win you need to be brutally offensive. Is that a problem at all?
Laurie_Menke: No...you're right. That's the way to play the game. I joke around with zoltar about being peaceful and all, and I am in real life, but this game is about destroying the enemy quickly and efficiently. ;o) Good luck!
