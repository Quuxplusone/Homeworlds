2) pedrop: Homeworld B2 Y1 G3
	Jesse: Hello, and have a good game.

3) Jesse: Build G1 Jesse
	pedrop: Hi. The same to You! Are You experienced player?

4) pedrop: Build G1 Pedrop
	Jesse: Yes, I am a very experienced player.  I see from your comments in another game that you are new.  It is always my pleasure to help a new player get better, so let me know if you have any questions.

5) Jesse: Trade G1 Y1 Jesse
	pedrop: Thanks for that, and I hope that beacouse of the other games I won't do any more basic mistakes and be some challenge for You:)

6) pedrop: Trade G1 Y1 Pedrop

7) Jesse: Build Y2 Jesse
	pedrop: Of course feel free to comment my bad moves, if You will see such ones:)

8) pedrop: Discover Y1 Pedrop G3 Newhope
	Jesse: Certainly.

9) Jesse: Trade Y1 R1 Jesse

10) pedrop: Build G1 Pedrop
	Jesse: There's a saying that when your opponent picks up a gun (red piece), you must pick up a gun.  You do have a little time before you really have to, because it's hard for me to get to you this early in the game.  Just don't wait too long...

11) Jesse: Build R1 Jesse
	pedrop: Ok, I won't, thanks:) (You are fast with guns then... ;P ;) )

12) pedrop: Trade G1 Y1 Pedrop
	Jesse: I was fast with the guns mostly because I saw the opportunity to make it awkward for you to grab one yourself.

13) Jesse: Discover R1 Jesse G2 Pripyat
	pedrop: I see:) (hmm... openinig with red small planet...;) ) 

14) pedrop: Build Y2 Pedrop
	Jesse: The r1 system marker is mostly for defense early on, and the flexibility offered by defending with G3 and Y3 later.  Jumping into red quickly makes the first point less important.
	Jesse: It's also good for developing green and yellow early on, since you can have a couple of each at the homeworld without getting into danger of a catastrophe.

15) Jesse: Discover R1 Jesse G2 Kyzyl
	pedrop: Thanks for advices:) I already have experienced that having yellow star on me starting system is 
"not-so-good";) I had to "loose" 1 action to move yellow ships out of it if i wanted to develop them further. And this action is usually very valuable...;) So I agree that this is very useful opening and advice from You.
	Jesse: Having yellow in your system can also be good, because you can immediately start moving things out without taking a turn to trade for yellow.  So there are pros and cons either way.
