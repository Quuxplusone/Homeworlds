jerzy: Which is more useful: a r2 or a y2?

13) jerzy: Build Y1 Jerzy

14) zoltar: Build Y2 Zoltar
zoltar: It depends upon the position. Early in the game, a Y2 is definitely more useful, as spreading your pieces out in order to grow is crucial. You have to get a red ship when your opponent does (as you saw in the last game), but once you have a red ship, then it entirely depends upon the position. The general principle is to try to take whatever allows you to build 3-pip ships as soon as possible, and then you can always trade among the colors on a blue star or sacrifice a blue piece to get the one most needed. Having more large ships of any kind is a huge advantage, as a large ship of any color can bully any smaller ships as long as there is even just a single R1 parked somewhere at any star that can be sacrificed.

15) jerzy: Trade Y1 B1 Jerzy
zoltar: Note that here I could have made a classic beginners' mistake and sacked my Y3 to send my Y1 into your homeworld and blow up your yellow star and ships. It would leave me without a large ship in my homeworld. In fact, in this case, as with only the blue star left our homeworlds would become directly connected, you could build a yellow ship and march your G3 into my homeworld and win before I would have a chance to rebuild. The principle is: don't sacrifice a lot to blow up one star if you can't attack the other one and will be vulnerable to counter-attack.

jerzy: I don't quite understand how is the large yellow supposed to act as a "bank" in this opening.
zoltar: The idea would be that you would have a lone g2 (or g1) sitting on the y3 star. Later in the game, when all the yellow is taken, you sack your g2, destroying the star; you then on the same turn build that y3 from the star in one of your systems, and (if it was a g2 and not a g1 you sacked) you rebuild the g2 somewhere else. The small and medium star combo is called "the banker" because you are one step from large stars, which can become "investments" when you park green ships on them.
