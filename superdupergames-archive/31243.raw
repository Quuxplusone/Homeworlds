Homeworlds Online (SDG# 31243)
Started: 2017.1.24, Ended: 2017.6.19
Participants: w00t (S), Ausmuh (N)
Winner: w00t

1) Ausmuh: Homeworld G3 B1 Y3

2) w00t: Homeworld B3 Y2 G3

3) Ausmuh: Build Y1 Ausmuh
	w00t: It's been far too long since I played any homeworlds... I'm psyched you're still active on here to challenge :)
	Ausmuh: Right! I was excited to see you here also! I'm so rusty. Back into the fire! I stole the 48 hour turn scheme from Star Realms (A card game you should still totally check out the app for, Kami and I still play and the online community is so active) And having to check in a little more often has made it easier to remember and more enjoyable. Or the game will just end. Either way, less time wasted.

4) w00t: Build G1 W00t

5) Ausmuh: Trade Y1 G1 Ausmuh
	w00t: Star Realms... I'll have to look into it......

14) w00t: Trade G2 Y2 W00t
	Ausmuh: No worries man! I'm pretty much on auto-pilot until I shake the dust off anyways. After about turn 5, I'm just kinda making moves to see what happens for now. Hopefully I remember some of the finer points later. :)

15) Ausmuh: Trade Y1 R1 Ausmuh

	Ausmuh: I'm much too curious to not make that move.
	w00t: I thought you would do that >:)  I just hope my scheming was adequate...
	w00t: dammit... I thought illuminati was connected to your homeworld for some reason :\

21) Ausmuh: Sacrifice R1 Ausmuh
Attack G2S W00t

22) w00t: Trade G3 R3 W00t
	Ausmuh: That's one reason I like the table better. The paths stay clearer.  Still only played like 2 games tops IRL with other folk though. Sad.
	w00t: amen to that... sdg seems to put the star systems in awkward orders

23) Ausmuh: Sacrifice G2 W00t
Build Y1 W00t
Build Y2 W00t
Catastrophe W00t Yellow
	Draw5PlayAll: The systems are ordered alphabetically.
	w00t: huh... hadn't noticed that, but they sure are alphabetical... It'd be a nice touch if we could drag the tile that star system is into a preferred placement... but alas, I'm content just having online homeworlds! :)
	Ausmuh: Good to know!! Thanks Draw5PlayAll!

24) w00t: Move Y1 Yin Ausmuh
	Draw5PlayAll: So if you agree to name them purposefully, you might get the effect you want.
	w00t: AHHH!! I so knew that was gonna happen, but I couldn't find a way to stop it :'(

25) Ausmuh: Build G1 Blucifer
	w00t: You ought to join that 4 man standing challenge that Draw5PlayAll issued... I joined another 4 man challenge, but one of the players is very not active, so we've been waiting like 3 days for him to move

26) w00t: Build Y1 Ausmuh
	Ausmuh: Non binary you say?? I could at least give it a whirl.
	Draw5PlayAll: Once a game starts you cannot join it, even if an existing player forfeits on time
	w00t: I was talking about the team one that's still waiting for two more players...

27) Ausmuh: Trade Y3 R3 Ausmuh

28) w00t: Sacrifice Y1 Ausmuh
Discover Y1 Ausmuh G2 Run_away
	Ausmuh: Maybe we should join that 3 player sinister game.
 
Also, maybe you should stop trying to blow up all my ships. :)
	Draw5PlayAll: Yes, join the 3P.
 
Says the only player who still has an intact homeworld...

29) Ausmuh: Build R1 Ausmuh
	w00t: I'm down to join it... not sure how sinister works, but it sounds sinister... 

30) w00t: Build Y1 Run_away
	Draw5PlayAll: Sinister = destroy the player on your left to win. If anyone else causes their elimination, the game continues and your target changes.

31) Ausmuh: Build G2 Blucifer

32) w00t: Discover Y1 Run_away G3 O_o

33) Ausmuh: Trade G2 Y2 Blucifer

34) w00t: Build Y2 Yan

35) Ausmuh: Trade G1 R1 Blucifer

36) w00t: Move Y1 Yan W00t

37) Ausmuh: Trade R3 Y3 Ausmuh

38) w00t: Build G1 Illuminati
	w00t: I am so doomed :)

39) Ausmuh: Trade G1 B1 Blucifer
	Ausmuh: Haha you'd think that, but sometimes I have a very hard time putting together the endgame. I had Felix in a bad spot in our last game, but fumbled it all somewhere along the way! o.O

40) w00t: Build Y2 Yan
	w00t: That happened to me recently on a game, too! I think it was even against Felix.... I had him in a tight corner, but wasn't watching his pieces and he catastrophe'd all my ships at my homeworld... clever guy :)

41) Ausmuh: Trade Y3 G3 Ausmuh

42) w00t: Build Y3 Run_away

	Laurie_Menke: Hi w00t... I just wanted to let you and Ausmuh know that I'm making a list of games to ask Aaron to end due to abandonment.  I know you are both currently active on SDG right now, but this game seems abandoned, so I am going to include it on the list unless one of you says not to in the next 24 hours.  I hope that's the right thing to do.  :)
