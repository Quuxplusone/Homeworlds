Homeworlds Online (SDG# 36748)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2020.7.14, Ended: 2020.7.15
Participants: Layana (S), Babamots (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) Babamots: Homeworld R3 G2 B3
	Layana: Hi there, I have never played this game before. So any hints might be appreciated. 

2) Layana: Homeworld B2 R1 G3
	Babamots: Sure! Have you read the rules? The latest version of the rules is here:

(You'll have to copy and paste)
 
It's your first turn now, so you'll need to pick your homeworld star colors and sizes as well as your first ship. If you're not sure what to do, I suggest a medium blue star, a small red star, and a large green ship. On SDG, you give that command by typing this:
 
homeworld b2 r1 g3
	Babamots: One other thing: do you know how this game got started? I didn't think I had any open challenges that you could have joined, and if you had challenged me, I thought SDG should have asked me if I wanted to play (instead, the game began immediately without asking if I wanted to accept).
 
Just curious!

3) Babamots: Build B1 Babamots

4) Layana: Build G1 Layana
	Layana: Ok, thanks for the hints. I'll go with your recommendation, then, even though I feel I'd rather start with yellow than red - this way, I'll have to get a yellow ship to move out, won't I?
 
And yes, the game was one of your open challenges. It's unrated, which is what I'm looking for for the first 5 games. 

5) Babamots: Trade B1 Y1 Babamots

6) Layana: Trade G1 Y1 Layana
	Babamots: Yes, you'll need to trade a ship for yellow before you can move to another system.

7) Babamots: Build B1 Babamots

8) Layana: Build G1 Layana

9) Babamots: Build B1 Babamots

10) Layana: Build G1 Layana

18) Layana: Trade G2 B2 Layana

19) Babamots: Trade B3 Y3 Babamots

20) Layana: Sacrifice G1 Cassiopeia
Build Y1 Layana
	Babamots: I think your first move was better since it kept a large ship at your home. But I can't invade yet, so you should be ok.

21) Babamots: Sacrifice G2 Babamots
Build B2 Babamots
Build B3 Bolarus
	Layana: Well, eventually, I'm probably going to sacrifice one of the G3s again, anyway, and then I can rebuild that in my homeworld, right?

22) Layana: Move Y1 Layana Cassiopeia

23) Babamots: Build B3 Babamots
	Babamots: That will probably be OK, but I recommend doing it sooner than later.

	Babamots: Yeah, I don't like the pressure of playing ranked games. I'd be happy to play another if this one is looking too discouraging.
 
If at any point you'd like to do some reading about strategy or try some position puzzles, I've got a little website you can take a look at here:

The Icehouse Wiki guide is pretty good too:

	Layana: Thanks, I'll look into it.
