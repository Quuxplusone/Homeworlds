6) TwoShort: Trade B3 Y3 Twoshort

7) spearjr: Build B2 Spearjr

8) TwoShort: Build B2 Twoshort
TwoShort: OK... So far you're doing fine. I'd generally recommend against a small blue star as first player, because it lets me play this opening... but you've found the right response to it.

9) spearjr: Discover B2 Spearjr G2 Alpha

10) TwoShort: Discover B2 Twoshort G3 Grogar

11) spearjr: Build B2 Alpha

12) TwoShort: Build B3 Grogar
TwoShort: Hmm, I wouldn't call that move stupid, but if I'm correctly predicting where it will lead in a few moves I think you'll regret it. One should generaly be wary of growing the last 2 pointer of a color.

spearjr: If this was in person, I think I could formulate some sort of strategy, but I'm totally floundering here. Sigh.

22) TwoShort: Build B1 Grogar
TwoShort: Actually, I was thinking you were doing really well, and despite your claims, I'd better stop looking for you to make newbie mistakes. Have you played much off-line?
TwoShort: It is interesting how playing here differs from face-to-face... I'm actually not nearly as good in person.

23) spearjr: Discover G2 Alpha B3 Beta
spearjr: I'm in the midst of a 4 player game here and I've played 7 games off-line. However we had a number of rules wrong for all but 2 of those. (We forgot sacrifice completely!! And we were allowing players to create a new ship in a system, so long as they had the green power in the system, regardless if they already had a ship of that color there.)
