It looks like I'm going to be there. Brian as well. We set up to play Ora at Labora (I'm curious about that game, lots of hype, we will see if justified...). What else I don't know yet but I'm dreaming of an 18xx.
 
Will you be there?
	goulo: Oh, interesting, I had not heard about this event. It looks like Gratislavia, but isn't Gratislavia...?
 
It's also just 1 week after Pionek, strange timing! But at least not the SAME weekend as Pionek. :)
 
I think I will be free that weekend, so I hope to go to it. Thanks for the info!

6) AdamBadura: Trade Y1 R1 Adambadura

7) goulo: Build G1 Goulo
	AdamBadura: It looks like Gratislavia but it is not. It seems different people are behind this one. I don't know which people. I never heared about it.
 
I have mixed feelings. As this might mean some break in the gaming community in Wroc³aw. But looking just at the known facts: hey! we have a second convention! lets cherish! ;)
	goulo: Certainly! More gaming events = A Good Thing. :)

	AdamBadura: Sometimes I wish there was a "try mode" when you execute a command but only to look at the results before approving (and submiting) or canceling. It is sometimes uneasy to see how it will look like after a catastrophe.
	AdamBadura: Your is more "geek-y" than you claim she is... After all not only she came today for the Fest alone but also she took part in some contest and got a prize!
 
So now I'm starting to wonder why she never comes at my place when you do... ;)
 
 
And to be more serious that Hex game got my interest. I intended to challange you but as it seems it is not implemented here...
	AdamBadura: *Your girl
	goulo: Her gaming enthusiasm goes in waves. She got very excited at this past Pionek. :)
 
About Hex - it is playable at some other sites, e.g. littlegolem.net (but littlegolem is having DNS problems or something, not reachable the past few days, sigh) I play Hex there.

	AdamBadura: I just read a review in Swiat Gier Planszowych. Seemed interesting yet it didn't interest me enough to try to find it someplace. If you have it now we can play some time. Yet I'm afraid I will have time for gaming after Christmas only.

	AdamBadura: Sorry again for delays. Its not my usual type of playing. The rector of our parish died in car accident on Thusday. As I'm somewhat involved in tha parish (mostly by administrating the web site and being member of board) it consumes significant amount of time. (Especially that the rector was an important person otherwise as well being a "pra³at" and "prof. dr hab."...)
	goulo: No problem, almost all the PBEM games are going much slower lately, I notice. It really slows down in December!
 
Sorry to hear about the rector's car accident. Good luck to you dealing with his death and all the other stuff.

	goulo: I see no hope for me here!
	goulo: happy new year! :)
	AdamBadura: Hmm... Interesting. I wasn't sure of this game. It seemed to me I had a little advantage but I think you could have outplayed me by skills.
 
Happy new year!
	goulo: I think you have too many ships, and I couldn't realistically catch up, nor could I see how to create enough blues to try rushing your homeworld.
