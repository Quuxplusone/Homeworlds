	wil: It is all about experimentation in learning this game...  lots of strategy with few moving parts...

	wil: it just got worse...
	radynski: yeah, I knew I was screwed like 10 turns ago, but was hoping you would just screw up.  :)
Good game.
	wil: that is always the potentiall....a couple of reboots and this game can turn on the dime.
