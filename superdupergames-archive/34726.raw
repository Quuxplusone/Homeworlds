Homeworlds Online (SDG# 34726)
Variants: "Unrated, Hard time"
Started: 2018.11.15, Ended: 2018.12.6
Participants: Babamots (S), AnalogKid (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) AnalogKid: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3
	Draw5PlayAll: Oh I never knew AnalogKid was into Homeworlds...
	AnalogKid: I've only played it a few times and that was years ago now.  So I'm a novice who needs to review the rules. :) 
	AnalogKid: I do think it is a very impressive and rich game.

2) Babamots: Homeworld G3 B1 B3 *
	AnalogKid: Babamots: Thanks again for starting all of these new games with me, today.  I hope that you don't mind me taking the banker option.  Have a good game! ^_^
	Babamots: I do think the "banker" is the strongest homeworld, even though I only see "investments" work in maybe 1/4th of games. I think it's more important that it makes it easy to discover large systems when your opponent is about to build the large ship that--for whatever the reason--you can't build yourself.
 
I think that, for a more even game, the less-experienced player should get the banker. The online rules suggest it, in fact. I also think moving first is a pretty good advantage. It seems to me that the most fair opening would be banker for the second player to move, something else for the first.
 
Since you included b1 in your home system, I can do something kind of sneaky that ensures that I get a medium ship before you do. I'm going to make my first ship AND one of my system markers blue. If you ever want a blue ship, you'll probably need to trade your large ship for it.
 
You said you'd like to learn, so I'm planning on giving lots of unsolicited advice like the above.
 
Anyway, you're welcome to the banker this time. If you beat me, I get dibs next time.

3) AnalogKid: Build G1 Analogkid
	AnalogKid: Thanks for the advice and for being willing to teach me. :)
 
I'll have to trade a large ship to get blue?  I assume then that you intend to grab the last small blue so that I can't trade for it AND you'll then be able to build a B2 ship while I cannot since I don't yet have a blue ship?  Interesting.

4) Babamots: Build B1 Babamots

5) AnalogKid: Build G1 Analogkid
	Babamots: I don't know if that trick really does much for me, but people do it pretty often. It won me a game once when my opponent didn't think to trade the large ship and I just got to build as much of that color as I wanted in every size.
	AnalogKid: I'm considering two choices: (a) build another G1, or (b) venture out to a new system with the G1 I've got.  I'll go with (a).  Feel free to let me know what you think I should've done. ;-)

6) Babamots: Trade B3 Y3 Babamots
	AnalogKid: My reasoning: If you trade for a G1 soon then I will get first dibs on a G2.  (Or maybe I won't since I have to move/trade at least one of my G ships first?).  Either way, there is no threat of you invading yet with a green ship and I will probably trade in my G3 for a B3 next turn anyways.  

7) AnalogKid: Trade G3 B3 Analogkid

8) Babamots: Build B2 Babamots

9) AnalogKid: Discover G1 Analogkid B3 Alcyone
	AnalogKid: *sigh* I still can't safely build a blue ship.

10) Babamots: Discover B1 Babamots G2 Risa
	Babamots: That was intentional. For teaching's sake, I should have mentioned it in case you didn't notice.

11) AnalogKid: Build G1 Alcyone

12) Babamots: Build B2 Risa

13) AnalogKid: Discover B3 Analogkid Y3 Sigmaoctantis
	AnalogKid: Well, this might be a violation of the "Primary Directive" but ...

14) Babamots: Sacrifice Y3 Babamots
Discover B1 Risa Y3 Iconia
Move B2 Risa Iconia
Move B2 Iconia Analogkid
	Babamots: I think you're about to get a lesson on why keeping a large at home is so important.

15) AnalogKid: Trade B3 R3 Sigmaoctantis
	Babamots: Either that or I've totally shot myself in the foot. It's pretty hard to calculate more than a move or two in the future and I've been known to blow it.
	Babamots: OK, with some more thought, I see you can survive this, but you'll have to be careful. This is should be a great tactical exercise for you.
	Babamots: So to be clear, my move was not a good example of something you should do. It's risky at best. There are times when you can totally charge at your opponent the moment there's a weakness, but this isn't quite it. More likely I've thrown away my only large for almost nothing. But, figuring out how to deal with an overly aggressive move like mine is good for you.
	AnalogKid: Hmm... I wasn't anticipating that move.  I thought you might trade for a red and then I'd have to move my large ship back to my homeworld to defend.
	AnalogKid: That was why I moved the B3 to a yellow star.  In retrospect, I think I really needed to go to a green start to accomplish my goal. :|
	AnalogKid: Interesting two-pronged threat!  I think I see a solution...

16) Babamots: Trade B2 R2 Analogkid
	Draw5PlayAll: I do not see the second prong.
	Draw5PlayAll: Also what are Alcyone and SigmaOctantis?

17) AnalogKid: Move R3 Sigmaoctantis Analogkid

18) Babamots: Discover R2 Analogkid Y3 Risa
	AnalogKid: Alcyone is a blue giant star and Sigma Octantis is a yellow giant star. See Wikipedia for more. :-)

19) AnalogKid: Build G2 Analogkid

20) Babamots: Build B2 Babamots

21) AnalogKid: Build G2 Analogkid

22) Babamots: Trade B2 G2 Babamots

	AnalogKid: Ach! I'm so sorry about letting this game timeout.  I was enjoying it. :(  Would you be willing to start another one? (Praetorian too if you wish)
	Draw5PlayAll: Praetorian is nice. You should challenge me to it. I do not get to play it enough.
 
But I prefer the assassin.
