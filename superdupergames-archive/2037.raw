	TwoShort: Well, I've always liked the aesthetics of the physical Icehouse pieces.   But I played the game (against Andy Looney) over the course of two evenings during which we had the game set up in a side room, and we would sneak off between other activities to make our moves.  So it actually had much more of the not-quite-real-time feel of playing here than it might have.
