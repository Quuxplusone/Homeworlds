	wil: When I get challenged to a game by someone I don't know...I take a look at their game play on the site...  If never played homeworlds I then ask if they want a learning game...where I inform them of my thoughts on their moves and missed opportunities...  saw yours and it looked like you were in a bunch of games..yet never played (here at least)  Do you have a copy of arcade at home?

4) Vezeon: Build G1 Vezeon
	Vezeon: Yea, I have a copy at home but nobody is really into homeworlds. I've only been able to play a handful of times so i'm excited to use this website.

5) wil: T G1 B1 Wil
	wil: My recommendation is to lose and lose often...you will start to see attacks coming at you...and watch them.build...and then when you try that attack you'll get to see the counter...ask any questions you want during the game.  I usually recommend you set up a live set on a table so you can look at them.  (But you are in so many games...but still...if you want to ponder..) 

6) Vezeon: Trade G1 Y1 Vezeon
	Vezeon: I love the advice. Particularly the live set up of the game.  I might have to try that one day. Thanks for your help.
