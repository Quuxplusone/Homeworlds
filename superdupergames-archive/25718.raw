	TeeTeeTee: I'd say more, but I feel a little, well, pompous when commenting on a game in-progress. Ask me about the opening later!

16) TeeTeeTee: Build B2 Paris
	ajo: And I'd say more about what I had expected you to do this last turn instead of "build g2", but I don't want to give you ideas. ;D

19) ajo: Trade G2 Y2 Beta
	ajo: Well, I think that from this position ( http://superdupergames.org/?page=archive_play&gid=25718&idx=12 ) I would have done "trade b2 r2" to get that fourth color, relieve the blue situation at your homeworld, and threaten my forward development a bit.

25) ajo: Build G2 Alpha
	TeeTeeTee: It was a strong move, though; I rarely get surprised  like that in this game. Well done

	ajo: Good game! So what were you going to say about the opening? :)
	TeeTeeTee: Thanks for the game! I always prefer the games where people don't take days to make a single move.
 
I think that I was ahead from the start because I had a far stronger opening than you did. I reckon that it's always the stronger move to choose a small/medium homeworld if your oppenent hasn't done so already. Also, the colour of the small pyramid in someone's homeworld is generally the easiest colour to monopolise, so I think you should have grabbed a blue pyramid on your third move - that was your last chance to get a grasp on blue in the game...
 
Also, I stand by "7: ... Build g2 TeeTeeTee"; I think that it gave me a chance to access more greens without risking losing control of the blues, and I wasn't at risk of a blue catastrophe. I think that a better time for me to get a red ship would have been to trade a g3 for an r3 on my 10th move.
	ajo: That's a good point about small blue. You definitely locked me out of blue very effectively. I'll try monopolizing your small homeworld pyramid's color next game. ;)  Play again?
