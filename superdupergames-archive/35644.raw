	capi3101: Guess you're serious about keeping me out of blue there, wil. Geez...
	capi3101: I see why you didn't want to keep the initial permutation of that move though.

	capi3101: Damn. That's a nice engine setup. Sac the G3 at your homeworld next turn - you've got enough spots to safely grow blue, including your homeworld. Rinse, repeat...
	capi3101: Meanwhile I piddle my way along.
	capi3101: I could swap my big ship for blue, for all the more good that does me...I think that gets my big ship catted out of existence in two moves.
	capi3101: If I don't, however, you'll have a doomsday machine set up in four moves.
	capi3101: Maybe I should just swap for the large yellow and get it over with...
	capi3101: Don't worry, I won't.
	capi3101: Hell if I know what to do, though.

	wil: Nobody can pass those up!

31) wil: T B3 Y3 Caeruleum
	capi3101: Question is whether or not that was the best choice for me. Cost me two mediums and a small in exchange for three (?) of yours including a large. At this point, though, I lack green entirely...and I haven't broken your engine.

32) capi3101: Trade Y3 G3 Capi3101

	capi3101: Dammit. Be that way.

36) capi3101: Build G1 Capi3101
	capi3101: Trydnt bluebirded me yesterday, so now I've learned to be conscious of what exactly is sitting at my homeworld. For example, B1 ship plus B2 star is susceptible to Y3 sac to move a pair of blues moving in...
	capi3101: I couldn't tell if you were still setting that up or ready to pull the trigger. Would you have used the large blue at Y3 for that, or waited one turn to move the small one at your homeworld for the same purpose?
	wil: Blue bird and doomsday are powerful plans
	wil: 7 habits 4 highly effective HWs begin with end in mind

37) wil: T B3 G3 Y3
	capi3101: Crap. There goes half my homeworld.
	capi3101: ...and the part that lets me trade to boot.

38) capi3101: Discover R1 Morosi G3 Ego-mortui

39) wil: B B3 Y3
	wil: We've got a queen assembly line to run for a bit...
	capi3101: Yes...you're going to want to set up 3 reds in size 1 and 2 systems and grab another large yellow to finish setting up the machine. How to go about disrupting that plan effectively...
	capi3101: Build G1 capi3101!!!
 
...kidding.
