	zoltar: Ok, I have no chance.  gg
	jbj77: Thanks for the great game.  We'll have to have a rematch some time.
	zoltar: Ok. That would be great.  I could have played longer, as I have the red ships, but your advantage with the Yellow, and you're eventually going to get the Blues again and blow up my star and I can't prevent it, so I figured it was hopeless.
	jbj77: Yah, I was really worried about you having all of the reds, but my plan was to deprive you of all yellows so you would be immobilized and couldn't really use your red advantage.  I'm still not certain I would have won had you not resigned.
