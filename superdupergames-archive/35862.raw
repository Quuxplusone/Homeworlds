	Babamots: I've started to call that technique a "dirty factory." I've got a nice material advantage now, but my color diversity has suffered.

20) Babamots: Trade R1 G1 Babamots
	Babamots: Good choice! You made me go to red alert :-).

21) LanguiDude: Build R1 Languidude
	LanguiDude: I was quite pleased with that move. Happy to hear it was effective. :-)

22) Babamots: Trade R3 Y3 Antoinette

23) LanguiDude: Trade R3 Y3 Languidude
	Babamots: I'm threatening to make a red catastrophe at your home. Choose carefully.
	Babamots: Out of curiosity, do you have a theme in mind for your system names? So far, I interpret Adama as a fictional fleet commander, Antoinette as a queen, and Brahim as a varna. Maybe you're just picking anything that starts with A then B etc.?
	LanguiDude: It's mostly just sci-fi. Marie Antoinette made an appearance in an episode of Dr. Who (and it's one of my favorites), and Brahmin is also what they call the two-headed cow-mutations in the Fallout franchise. :-D
 
But also, I'm not above picking a word that just sounds fun. I did pick Brahmin with a full understanding of the various translations. I was gonna' call it, like, Booyah, or something - but I realized a more level-headed, calm approach would pay off better than a brash and bold statement. Which proved to be true, since I realized you could just trade, and thus be out of threat for a catastrophe... :-D

24) Babamots: Build R3 Orion

25) LanguiDude: Build B1 Languidude

26) Babamots: Move Y3 Antoinette Orion
	LanguiDude: (Apparently I messed up my 18th century women: Jeanne Antoinette Poisson is the one that appears in the Dr. Who episode, by her more popular name: Madame de Pompadour. Marie Antoinette said "let them eat cake," just like the Killer Queen in Queen's song...)
	LanguiDude: So it appears that I just pick cool words, and make them mean whatever I want....... >.>

27) LanguiDude: Sacrifice Y3 Languidude
Discover R1 Languidude Y1 Kobayashi
Move R1 Kobayashi Orion
Discover R2 Brahmin G3 Casanova
Catastrophe Orion Red
	Babamots: I've always used worlds of Star Trek. I usually fit the world to the system color (either by skin color or other species traits). Folks from Orion are green-skinned, Klingons are aggressive so they get red, etc.
	Babamots: I also use the Pakled system if I'm trying to recover from doing something super dumb.
	Babamots: Or Gravesworld if I'm feeling like a supergenius.
	Draw5PlayAll: Gravesworld?!
	Babamots: Ira Graves named a planet after himself because he's so proud of being smart.
	Babamots: He not-so-creatively called it Gravesworld.
	LanguiDude: I really enjoy Star Trek. My knowledge of it is nowhere near vast enough to think up names on the spot like that, but the trivia is awesome :-)

28) Babamots: Discover Y3 Orion R1 Nausicaa
	LanguiDude: I'm sure that wasn't the right move. But I'm not sure there was a better one...

29) LanguiDude: Trade B1 Y1 Languidude
	LanguiDude: trade b1 y1 languidude

30) Babamots: Move Y3 Nausicaa Languidude
	LanguiDude: (let me just type that in my notebook, and the circle will be complete...)
	Babamots: I think you were better off building up. You can often side-step someone's large-ship advantage by not putting more than one ship in any non-home system. That way the single ship can just run away if I try to invade.

31) LanguiDude: Build Y1 Languidude

32) Babamots: Sacrifice R3 Babamots
Attack Y1 Languidude
Attack Y1 Languidude
Attack G1 Languidude
	LanguiDude: yeah, I see it now - with the red sacrifice... gg

33) LanguiDude: Trade B1 Y1 Languidude

34) Babamots: Catastrophe Languidude Y
Pass
	LanguiDude: I guess after you take it there will be no one left to yell "catastrophe!"
	LanguiDude: Our galaxy is not kind to the navigators. Must be some rough wormholes... :-D
	Babamots: Good game! I think you're improving. Want another go?
	LanguiDude: I am really enjoying myself - let's do it. :-)
