TwoShort: So I feel a little guilty - normally for someones first game, I'd be giving them a fair amount of pointers and advice, but that takes more attention than I've had during this game, so I've just been systematically destroying you :)
TwoShort: Anyway, tip number 1: try starting with a green ship, it's usually best.
TwoShort: Tip number 2: watch out for catastrophes. I could move my y2 from Bluonia into Plasmulon, and cause a catastrophe that would cost me little and leave you crippled.
TwoShort: Typically, that's exactly what I'd do, but in this case, I think I see an even faster route to victory...

27) TwoShort: Trade G2 R2 Bluonia
MrMoto: Don't worry about it -- I see that I have a lot to learn! Your strategy of sacrificing green ships to build up your fleet makes a lot of sense.

MrMoto: As for catastrophes, I was concentrating on just not building four like-coloured ships in one system. Clearly I must start to consider your moves -- I thought there would be more build-up before I would have to do so.

MrMoto: And finally I am honoured to lose against the second-best player in the world! :)

28) MrMoto: Trade Y2 G2 Plasmulon
MrMoto: Oh dear. I thought I would blow up the whole system, but I've just lost a bunch of ships. Hm ...
