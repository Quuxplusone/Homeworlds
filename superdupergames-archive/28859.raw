	Felix: I wouldn't say I kicked your butt. It was really close! Looking over the last game, I see where I think you could have turned the tables back on me on turn 12
	Felix: If you had traded your g3 for an r3 in your home system, I don't know if I could have overcome you, since I couldn't sacrifice my r2 at home. I may eventually have, but it would have been very tough.
