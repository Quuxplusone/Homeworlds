Homeworlds Online (SDG# 16421)
Variants: "Sinister"
Started: 2010.5.19, Ended: 2010.5.23
Participants: zara2stra (S), goulo (N), AdamBadura (E)
Winner: goulo

1) goulo: Homeworld G1 B2 Y3
	AdamBadura: What are the victory conditions?
	zara2stra: Kill the one to the left?
	AdamBadura: Or be the last man standing?
	zara2stra: in f2f I usually play with kill the one to the left (or kill the bad/good one) because the victor of the first fight will usually be weakened and easier to attack.
	zara2stra: in a three player game that might lead to turtling... of course we can play LMS if you want :)
	AdamBadura: Hmmm... I haven't thought about the weakening aspect. Lets wait for goulo to see what he says.
	AdamBadura: And to establis some facts:
1) zara2stra is to the left of AdamBadura,
2) goulo is to the left of zara2stra
3) Adam Badura is to the left of goulo
 
right?
	AdamBadura: Also in case of "kill the one to the left" mode the winner is obvious. But what about second and third place? Is it so that eliminated player looses eliminating player wins and game continues? (In case of 3 players game only one player is left so he gets the second place.)
	zara2stra: Concerning the lefty compass - yes. Concerning the winner - in KTOTTL there's only the winner; the player who manages to destroy his neighbour fastest wins, the remaining players are loosers. I think that it's much nicer in the standard good/bad mode, but the standard game works best in f2f mode, and would be rather hard to pull off online.
	AdamBadura: There is another way in OMS mode. Untill now I only thought of two subvariants:
1) All ships of eliminated player are removed from the game (but not the homeworld - after all it can contain ships of other players).
2) All ships of eliminated player remain int he game as neutral (so they still can be captured or lead to overpopulation).
 
But there is a third subvariant which might solve the weakening problem:
3) The eliminating player takes control of all ships of the elimnated player.
 
However would that make him/her too strong? But on the other hand this would encourage players to try to eliminate one another ASAP.
 
Another question is what mode is implemented here.
	goulo: Hi! I selected the "sinister" (kill the guy on your left) variant.
	goulo: And I agree with the "who's on the left" summary earlier, given the north/east/south alignment we have. :)

8) AdamBadura: Trade R1 Y1 Adambadura
	goulo: Does the user interface show your homesystem at the bottom, as if you were looking at a live game on a table? I.e. I see zara at the top, adam on the left, and me on the bottom. Does adam see it with zara on left, adam on bottom, and goulo on right? Or is goulo on bottom for everyone?

9) zara2stra: Build B1 Zara2stra
	AdamBadura: I see me on bottom, goulo on right, zara2stra on left so the system is smart. And now it is easy to see whom I shall destroy :) and from who is going to attack me.

51) zara2stra: Sacrifice B2 Mecatolrex
Trade R2 G2 Mecatolrex
Trade Y1 G1 Mecatolrex
Catastrophe Mecatolrex G
	AdamBadura: I prefer this to Branches however I might try again. Those other two I don't know so I would better learn them first. :)
	zara2stra: I never played Martian Chess nor Branches, but I used to play Volcano with my wife - it's a fun game, and I'd be happy to play (although it would be best to start it during the weekend - I have a lot of work tommorow). 
	AdamBadura: This will be a bloody game... ;)
 
Pity that except for red ships I'm very weak... :)
	AdamBadura: goulo, we have to be careful! zara2stra is going into a very secure strategy. He wants us all to use all the 1-ships so we cannot use them as stars while invading his homeworld. We have to maintain at least one 1-size star system to terrorize him... :)
	AdamBadura: By the way, what are our policies for politics? :)
 
As it comes to me I am very pro-politics either explitly here or through private messages.

52) goulo: Trade R3 G3 Goulo
	zara2stra: This should mess things up a little :P
	zara2stra: I have nothing against politics, although IMO this game really shines with the standard alignment game; there's much more room for bluff and politics.
	goulo: for me the standard game seems very odd; there's simply no way to know if someone is good or evil, so it's essentially random guessing, or acting skills (like a party game like Werewolf, which I don't think of as very strategic or interesting, but maybe that's just me :)

53) AdamBadura: Discover R3 Adambadura G2 Thevoid

	zara2stra: Goulo, you're right that the game gets a new flavour - but which one you prefer is entirely a question of preferences. Contrary to what you say there is a way to know if a certain player is good or evil. It takes a good liar to deceive other players both with what he says and what he does.   
	zara2stra: All good players work in a team against the bad one(s). So usually they will be much more reluctant to actually attack someone, unless they are sure that they face an evil player. Evil players on the other hand, won't care who attacks who, and won't have any second thoughts on attacking other players - they have to kill only one player and that's it. 
	goulo: Except how do you know who the other good players are, to work "together" with them? And a bad player can also work in a team against the alleged bad ones. Then if he gets a chance to be the supposedly good player who kills the supposed bad player, he wins. And if some other good player kills another good player, the bad player is OK with that result too. :)
 
I agree there are psychological/social skills that can come into play, but it's a lot more nebulous. Usually in these kinds of games I end up with 2 different players staring at me with serious sincere faces pointing at each other and both saying "Russ, I'M not the evil one, HE is", and it's indistinguishable from random noise for me. Quite possibly I am simply too socially lame to do well in such games. :)

56) AdamBadura: Discover R2 Flava Y1 Nothingness

57) zara2stra: Build B2 Zara2stra

58) goulo: Move R3 Verda Coldandempty
	AdamBadura: The Good/Evil mode seems indeed like Mafia game.
 
I enjoyed that game a lot. However in this full-information-no-luck game it feels kind of wierd. But still I would gladly try it out.
 
 
By the way. What happens if someone kills a wrong player? If I would kill goulo than there is no way to win for zara2stra so the only possibilities are that either I win or non of us. Or maybe I would become zara2stra's new left player?
 
 
It is easy to see we are very militaristic this time. :) But I guess zara2stra that the catastrophe you made helped only goulo. I'm not sure whether that wasa good move... :)
	goulo: I believe if your left-hand target is eliminated by another player, then the former left-hand target of your now-dead target becomes your new left-hand target.
	goulo: I'm sure zara is happier having you and me each have 2 R3's instead of you, who wants to kill him, having 3 R3's. :)
	zara2stra: By killing goulo you would become my new target. 
 
As for the catastrophe; Any other move would get you 3 ships in a decent system (after sacrificing an R3). The situation was bad due to my error (not taking the r3 when it was available). Right now I helped goulo, but my military situation would be bad either way, and by aiding him I took a bit of strain off my back - after all, the only way for guolo to win is to kill you before you kill me.

60) zara2stra: Discover B2 Zara2stra G1 Mostlyharmless
	AdamBadura: That costed me dearly. goulo keep in mind that if I am strong zara2stra have to play more defence against me than attack you. So in other words your safty is in my power. You should support me... :P

61) goulo: Discover Y1 Verda G2 Stelo
	zara2stra: Yeah, he should support you the same way you should support me: namely by trying to kill you at the same time ;)

	goulo: Adam, it's all your fault, for not having won and ended the game before I had the chance to catastrophe your blue star. :)
	AdamBadura: :D
