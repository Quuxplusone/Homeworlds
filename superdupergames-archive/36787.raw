	dlwillson: But, you could have done that anytime. I still don't get why that's better than any other time.

29) Draw5PlayAll: Trade Y2 G2 Taxation
	Draw5PlayAll: That's why.
	dlwillson: So, I guess I should have moved the R3 to sea, rather than creating an R1. Lesson learned. Good play.

30) dlwillson: Trade R2 G2 Sea
	dlwillson: Still... Unless I'm mis-remembering, you had that trade option before. For example, you could have traded your home Y3 for an R3 anytime. No, wait, you couldn't have, because then I *could* have forced a red cat. But it wasn't an option anywhere else, either? Hm...
