	zoltar: Moving your huge green ship didn't make sense to me, as the rules say it's best to keep a big ship at your homeworld.
	fnord: Actually, it was because of a misundertanding of the rules, on my part, I think.
	fnord: Oh, frell me!
	fnord: Couldn't the game have warned me I was gonna destroy my homeworld?
	fnord: The reason I moved my big ship there was to (attempt) to prevent you from attacking any ship I owned there.  I misread the rules, thinking you couldn't attack me if I had a larger ship in there.  
	zoltar: Ouch! It didn't let you take back the move?  Oh well.  We can start another one if you wish.  And this was my first victory in the game, after an awful blowout where I died in the 5th move or so.  Thanks for the game!
	fnord: No, it didn't.  I looked for it, that's for sure.
