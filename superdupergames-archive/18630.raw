	AdamBadura: Hi! I did the same while climbing up. Those inactive people are really enoying!
 
Currently (until evening on Monday 27th) I'm at my wife parents which limits severly possibility to make moves. Sorry for that!
	goulo: No problem. I've noticed all my SDG games have slowed down recently. :) Also I'll be in Germany from Monday till Sunday (Esperanto event), probably checking email less often.

Catastrophe Goulo R
	AdamBadura: Interesting move. My move will take some time as situation is becoming complex and I cannot afford another mistake.

35) goulo: Build G3 Goulo
	goulo: I wondered if you would do that. I figured it was OK for me as the result of the last 2 turns is that I lost 2 1-ships while you lost a 1-ship and a 2-ship. But of course the specific situation makes it hard to know if that simple analysis is valid. :)

36) AdamBadura: Discover G3 Adambadura Y2 Highway
	AdamBadura: I considered also catastrophing R in Smeraldeto however this would require me to use R2 too. Another way was to invade Smeraldeto with R and see what will you do (this could allow me to save Y2). But all this seemed bi to tricky and error-prone.
 
By the way did Artur contact you regarding Fridrich at UP next Saturday? He asked on forum whether there are any people willing to play and I suggested him to PM you as I suspect you do not read forum any more. (I wont play it and most likely I wont be there at all - those open hours are conflicting with Karol's needs... ;))

37) goulo: Discover G2 Goulo R1 Rubeneto

	goulo: Jeez, that sure turned the situation around for you. Homeworlds can be very unforgiving!
	AdamBadura: Yes. And I already did that "trick" to you some time ago.
 
But Homeworlds keeps surprising with such actions. Like that your sacrifical of G1 to recreate it somewhere else. Simple and briliant! Yet I missed that. ;)
 
But just keep on playing wating on my next mistake... ;)

	goulo: awesome. :)
	AdamBadura: How????????????!!!!!!!!!!
	AdamBadura: Oh...
	AdamBadura: And I had a second thought of that: will this not allow you to invade me. I somehow missed that opportunity. The most obvious one. To bad as I think I would have won it... :(
 
But the game was interesting!
	goulo: As you wrote a couple of days ago: "But just keep on playing wating on my next mistake... ;) "
So you were right! I waited for your mistake. :)
	goulo: That was quite a funny game with both of us making mistakes.
	AdamBadura: Yes. You made a stupid mistake with R which took away your victory. But The Universe made us even by giving it back to you on almost last possible moment. ;)
	goulo: It was funny after you did the blue catastrophe on me, I was looking thinking, is there any way I can get all 3 red ships to your homeworld soon? Wow, is it really that easy, just like that? I checked and rechecked to make sure I was not imagining it from wishful thinking. :)
