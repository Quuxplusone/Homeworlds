	Trydnt: well that was a fun little experiment 
	dlwillson: Good game and thank you! Interesting experiment. Did it go about how you thought it would?
	Trydnt: It became obvious pretty quickly that I was in a losing position. I didn't expect you to choose to make them directly connected. My thinking on taking 2 2-pip stars is that banker and fortress both have advantages in being able to control the stock of 1-pip and 3-pip stars (or turn 3-pip stars into ships later) so if I could fly to 1s and 3s then I'd be more capable of controlling the bank. I also thought having yellow from the start would be great in this situation but I think it would have made more sense to start with something else and trade for yellow. The 2-2 response might be better if you go second as you can choose color more appropriately and doesn't give opponent the chance to make them directly connected
	dlwillson: Wanna do it again? I could take first turn with whatever your like, then you do the thing again, or whatever.
	Trydnt: I'd like to play more weird universes. Some are broken but I think that playing even those would lead to some interesting strategy insights
