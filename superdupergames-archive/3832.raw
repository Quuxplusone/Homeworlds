zoltar: You're really into blowing things up this game!

33) fnord: Build R1 Fnord
zoltar: Though after each sequence when things got blown up, I ended up gaining an extra move or two after everything settled down, especially here, where at the end of the sequence I get to convert your last outpost at orary and end up with the extra small pieces.

zoltar: I didn't get that move.
fnord: Sure you did, you just took it... Or did you mean you didn't understand the move?

40) zoltar: Build R2 Orary
zoltar: I meant I didn't understand why you would simply move a piece where I could take it? That gives me yet another extra little ship for free.

41) fnord: Trade R1 Y1 Fnord
