zoltar: Well, you've already got an advantage. Given any opening, you're always going to have a couple extra 2-sized ships than I, as I can't grasp the openings yet and trade correctly, it seems.

12) TwoShort: Trade B2 Y2 Twoshort
zoltar: ugh, that's no good at all.
zoltar: I'll have to think some more about this.
