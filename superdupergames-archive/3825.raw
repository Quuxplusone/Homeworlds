1) game_lover: Homeworld Y3 G1 B3

2) Jesse: Homeworld B3 R2 G3

3) game_lover: Build B1 Game_lover
Jesse: Hello, there. Welcome to SDG. Have you played much Homeworlds, before?
game_lover: I've played a little, but never on Super Duper Games.

4) Jesse: Build G1 Jesse

5) game_lover: Trade B1 G1 Game_lover
Jesse: Is there any chance I've played you before, maybe at Origins?
game_lover: No. I've never been to Origins.

6) Jesse: Build G2 Jesse

7) game_lover: Discover G1 Game_lover Y2 Origins
Jesse: OK, just curious.
game_lover: I think I'll name the systems after the gaming conventions (Origins, GenCon, Dragon*Con, etc.) since I can't think of anything else.

8) Jesse: Trade G2 Y2 Jesse

9) game_lover: Build B1 Game_lover

10) Jesse: Build G2 Jesse

11) game_lover: Move B1 Game_lover Origins

12) Jesse: Discover G2 Jesse Y1 Katamari

13) game_lover: Trade B1 R1 Origins
game_lover: What is "Katamari"? Or is it just a name?

14) Jesse: Build G2 Jesse
Jesse: It's Japanese for "lump" or "clod". Also, Katamari Damashii ("lump spirit") is one of the best video games ever.

15) game_lover: Build R1 Origins
game_lover: how do I grow the R1 ship in Origins to an R2 ship. I tried "build R2 Origins" but that didn't work. Do you know how?
game_lover: "trade R1 R2 Origins" didn't work either
game_lover: Uh...nvm...apparently Homeworlds doesn't have a "build-up" power, just a "build the smallest available ship" power. I was thinking of IceTraders, the precessor to Homeworlds. Sorry!

16) Jesse: Discover G2 Jesse B1 N_
Jesse: Yeah, this makes it much more about managing the piece economy. Fortunately, I have no prior experience with IceTraders to distract me. :)

17) game_lover: Build G2 Origins

18) Jesse: Build G3 N_

19) game_lover: Build G3 Origins

20) Jesse: Move G2 Katamari Origins
Catastrophe Origins G

21) game_lover: Build B1 Game_lover

22) Jesse: Build G1 N_
game_lover: I wasn't sure if you'd cath that, which is why I undid my last move. I decided to create a G3 at game_lover, but I couldn't do that, so I just made a G3 at Origins, and you saw the catastophe.

23) game_lover: Trade B3 G3 Game_lover

24) Jesse: Trade G2 R2 N_
Jesse: It's usually best not to rely on your opponent missing something, unless you're desperate.

25) game_lover: Trade G3 R3 Game_lover

26) Jesse: Build R1 N_

27) game_lover: Trade R3 B3 Game_lover
game_lover: I'm going to try this and see how it works...

28) Jesse: Build G2 N_

29) game_lover: Move B3 Game_lover Origins
Jesse: OK, you do realize that you just gave me 3 free moves, I hope.

30) Jesse: Sacrifice Y2 Jesse
Move G3 N_ Origins
Move G3 Origins Game_lover

Jesse: I'd offer to rewind the game, but at this point I think it would be better to begin again.
game_lover: OK. Well, I'll surrender. YOU WIN!
