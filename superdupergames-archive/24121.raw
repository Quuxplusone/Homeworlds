Homeworlds Online (SDG# 24121)
Variants: "Hard time"
Started: 2013.6.10, Ended: 2013.6.18
Participants: Broccoli_Commander (S), wil (N)
Winner: Broccoli_Commander

1) wil: Homeworld B2 R1 G3
	Broccoli_Commander: Have a good game Sir!
	wil: Yea!!  I get to play a game while trying to climb the ladder...(instead of waiting for declines)!!

2) Broccoli_Commander: Homeworld B2 Y3 G3

3) wil: Build G1 Wil
	Broccoli_Commander: I know the pain, I've even kinda given up trying climbing higher because of this very reason
	wil: I've told them....they need to instigate a program...so the dead can be removed...

4) Broccoli_Commander: Build G1 Broccoli_commander
	Broccoli_Commander: Yeah for sure! But also the system is a bit stupid: I actually hesitated before accepting your challenge because I can only go *down* the ladder or, if I win, stay on the same spot!? 
==> why would I ever accept a challenge?
 
Well in the end I don't care about my rank so I accepted :-D Nevertheless it is much more interesting playing against the top players! Btw the worst thing is when an almost dead player still accepts the challenge: you then have to wait 3days between each turn till the #20 (i.e. 2 months!) even though you won on turn #5 (which was two weeks already). It strips out all of your motivation...


5) wil: Trade G1 R1 Wil
	wil: gad, I hear you....to me it is all about playing and learning...and when you lose you only go one down the ladder, when you do the denies at least you drop to the bottom.   I just wanna get up in that top 12-15 where it looks like they actuallly play games.

	wil: very nice...didnt see where the factory would be so advantageous....and how did you pick your moniker here?

23) wil: Build B1 Wil
	Broccoli_Commander: Thanks, well a factory is always useful ;)
About my moniker, well I came here to play homeworlds (I could try it live once and wanted to play more) and I came up with sth sounding both homeworlds-ish and very serious. Funnily I discovered afterwards that an online comic is also named broccoli commander.
And you, are you in anyway related to dlwillson or is it a "coincidence"?
	wil: coincidence...Iast name ...first name I believe, yeah I just didn't see I was setting you up for a factory....slowly learning.

31) wil: Move G2 Wil Y3a
