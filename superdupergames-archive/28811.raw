5) Felix: T G1 Y1 Felix

6) Tamiel: Build G1 Tamiel

7) Felix: Build Y1 Felix
	Tamiel: I think I was probably lucky the last game. You started with a red star in your homesystem and from what I've read that's harder to play, at least for beginners.
	Felix: Yeah, that's what I have heard, too. I like trying different strategies to experience for myself what works and what doesn't, and why. I've also heard that starting with a small and medium home star (the banker) is usually a bit stronger :)

8) Tamiel: Trade G3 Y3 Tamiel
	Felix: I am definitely still learning how to develop strategies in this. Hopefully you will learn some things too!

19) Felix: Move Y2 Gliesse1 Tamiel
	Felix: Woah. Bold move! But I think it leaves you pretty vulnerable because now you don't have a large ship, and I can come into your home system and take it over in a few moves, I think. Do you want to take it back?
	Tamiel: No, I don't take back the move. Thank you. I was in a bad position and I think this move might give me some (not much) fighting chance.  

	Tamiel: And that's that. :-) You win. Good game. I'll start a new challenge sometime at the beginning of Jan; until then I'm not sure about the internet connection since I'll be traveling around. You are more than welcome to join that the challenge.
	Felix: Good game! I had fun. I am definitely happy to play again any time. I will look for you challenge in January!
