Participants: Pheonixian (S), Felix (N)
Winner: Felix

1) Felix: H B3 Y2 G3

2) Pheonixian: Homeworld B1 G2 Y3
	Felix: Thanks for the game! Have you played before?

3) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	Pheonixian: Thank you as well! This is my first game so I have a lot to learn. I'm looking forward to it.
	Felix: Welcome! I'm pretty familiar with the game, but I'm definitely not the best on here. I'm happy to answer any questions you have or provide tips along the way. Hope you have fun!

4) Pheonixian: Build Y1 Pheonixian

5) Felix: Trade G1 B1 Felix
	Pheonixian: I hear the best on here are some of the best anywhere so certainly nothing wrong with not yet being ready to match them.
	Felix: Yeah. They crush me repeatedly, but the best way to improve is to play against good players and see what tactics they use against you!

6) Pheonixian: Trade Y1 G1 Pheonixian

7) Felix: Build B1 Felix
	Pheonixian: Indeed so. One learns quite a bit more from playing better players than oneself than from playing worse players.

8) Pheonixian: Build G1 Pheonixian

9) Felix: Discover B1 Felix G1 Ramp
	Felix: Certainly! One tip... you notice that I got the last small blue, and now you are unable to trade for blue until you are able to make a medium ship. You COULD trade your large yellow away for a blue, but that wouldn't be particularly helpful because then you would lose the ability to build yellow. Since I have all the small blues, I have essentially blocked you from getting to blue until you are able to build medium ships. That's not the ideal situation for you. So, in the early game, when you see that there is only one small left of a color you don't yet have, it's wise to try to trade for it and not let your opponent block you out of that color. Make sense? I hope that helps.

10) Pheonixian: Discover G1 Pheonixian B3 Ice

11) Felix: Build B2 Ramp
	Pheonixian: I see how that makes sense indeed. Thanks. I also noticed you took the last small green but avoided giving me the first new medium ship because I had nowhere available to build it.
	Felix: Exactly!

12) Pheonixian: Build G2 Ice

13) Felix: Trade B2 Y2 Ramp

14) Pheonixian: Trade G2 B2 Ice

15) Felix: Build B2 Ramp

16) Pheonixian: Build G2 Pheonixian

17) Felix: Trade B2 R2 Ramp

18) Pheonixian: Trade B2 R2 Ice

19) Felix: B B2 Ramp
	Felix:  Smart thinking to get a red when your opponent does. 

20) Pheonixian: Trade G2 B2 Pheonixian

21) Felix: Build G2 Felix
	Pheonixian: Yes I've heard that as a basic rule of strategy when I was reading the little writing that there is on Homeworlds strategy. "The Weapon Rule: once your opponent has a weapon, you need a weapon." 
But even without having already known that that it was clear you could move the R2 into ice, take the G1 and that would be a pretty weak position for me.
I was going to build the G2 but then I realized it was the last one so I reconsidered the wisdom of giving you an easy large green.

22) Pheonixian: Discover B2 Pheonixian G3 Kale
	Felix: Yeah, good call. It's always good to be aware of what your choice will allow your opponent to do. If it lets your opponent get something better than you, it may not be the wisest choice (although sometimes, you just have to bite the bullet and take a less-than-optimal choice)
	Felix: You seem to have a pretty solid grasp on the basic strategy. With a little practice, you'll be doing great

23) Felix: Discover B2 Ramp G3 Scale

24) Pheonixian: Build G2 Ice
	Pheonixian: I think a solid grasp of basic strategy is a fair evaluation. I think I can generally tell approximately how strong a move is in the short term. I still feel a little bit lost in terms of longer-term strategy, questions like "what colors should I be prioritizing?" and "where is it good to put my ships" and "when is it time to be more threatening?". If I had to sum it up with one question I'd say I don't have a good idea of how the overall game plays out. I guess those types of questions are the first part of the deep strategy that makes Homeworlds a great game.
	Felix: I think you hit the nail on the head. When I started on here a few months ago, I also had a pretty good understanding of the mechanics and I could discern what seemed to be a strong move in the short term. It took me at least 10-20 games to begin to really see and understand the deeper strategy, and I'm still learning it. Formulating that long term strategy and positioning your ships in an effective way is crucial, but really difficult to pull off, especially against a good opponent.
	Felix: One tip I have discovered is that starting with blue/yellow in your homeworld and starting with a large green as your first ship seems to be the most effective opening setup. It can be really helpful in the mid-game to have a large green ship that you can either sacrifice for three build actions, or you can set up a "factory" in your homeworld. This is more difficult to pull off when you have green as one of your home stars, since green quickly becomes a crowded color in your home system. This also comes down to preference and play style, of course, but I have found that I have struggled a lot more when I have included green in my home system instead of as my starting ship.
	Felix: Red can be pretty much ignored in the early game, unless of course your opponent gets it. You want to focus on building up your other colors and spreading out as much as possible so you have a lot of build potential. I would say Blue is actually one of the most important colors to prioritize early on. This depends on what your opponent is doing, of course, but blue is a strong color because you can easily trade it for anything. You also want to be careful about trading away the last of any color in a system. If you trade the last of any color, you immediately lose the ability to build that color in that system. It's usually preferable to try to build a second blue, for instance, and then trade one of those blues for another color. Make sense?
	Felix: Lastly, regarding longer-term strategy (and color prioritization) you obviously need to factor in what colors are present in your opponent's homeworld. I have blue and yellow in mine, so you will probably want to focus on building up enough blue and yellow ships in locations close to my homeworld. Once you have enough to cause a catastrophe, you can work on figuring out a way to move them into my system. Alternatively, you could also try to bring in green to destroy most of my ships (and my biggest ones) and then bring in your own medium or large ship to try to capture my remaining ships. If I changed one of my greens to a red or some other color, though, that would make things trickier for you. It truly is a deep game...

25) Felix: Sacrifice G3 Felix
Build G3 Felix
Build B2 Ramp
Build B3 Scale
	Pheonixian: I was in fact noticing that exact problem. I wanted to build green but it was getting very crowded quickly in my homeworld, so having yellow/blue as the star and a green ship seems likely to be better. The yellow ship hasn't seemed particularly useful at the beginning of the game, whereas green would allow a powerful sacrifice it seems. 
	Pheonixian: When I first started blue seemed a bit underpowered as a ship option honestly but as we move through the game it seems better and better, so it seems you are right about that. 

	Pheonixian: The multiple options for victory conditions also seem to be an important part of the depth of this game. There's also a really neat effect it seems where ships build up more and more which pushes the game towards catastrophes and ultimately a conclusion. It seems an important part of a well-designed game is a force driving it naturally to a conclusion and Homeworlds definitely has that feeling.

26) Pheonixian: Build Y1 Pheonixian
	Felix: Right. I recommend having no more than two of any color in a system if possible. If green is one of your homeworld stars, that makes it impossible to set up a factory... And you're right, the game does sort of drive itself to a conclusion in that way. I hadn't thought of it like that, but you're right!

27) Felix: Sacrifice G3 Felix
Build G3 Felix
Build Y1 Ramp
Build R1 Ramp
	Felix: And here you see an effective use of the factory, which results in me nearly monopolizing blue...

28) Pheonixian: Discover Y1 Pheonixian R3 Warship
	Pheonixian: Ouch. I planned to sac the g2 to take both blue pieces next turn but somehow completely blanked on the fact that you could just do that and prevent me. 
Much to learn for me it seems.
	Felix: That's okay. Best way to learn is to make mistakes! I've made many. It's always a learning experience.

29) Felix: Trade B3 Y3 Scale

30) Pheonixian: Build B3 Kale
	Pheonixian: Indeed, making mistakes has much potential to teach us.
This turn was kind of awkward I wasn't really sure what would be a good move. That might have been because I got myself into a bad spot and there wasn't a great move.
	Felix: Sometimes there just isn't a great move available and you have to do the best you can, or try to work toward a better move. It can be very difficult to see good moves in the midge when things are very complex. I often miss the ideal move myself.

31) Felix: Move R2 Ramp Scale

32) Pheonixian: Trade G1 R1 Pheonixian
	Pheonixian: That makes sense. Considering one's options for the next turns can probably reduce the difficulty but not eliminate it. The middle game does seem to be the most complex part of the game.

33) Felix: Move Y2 Ramp Warship

34) Pheonixian: Discover Y1 Warship G1 Venus

35) Felix: Build Y1 Scale
	Felix: Yeah, in my opinion, the mid game is the easiest place to lose track of things and make mistakes!

36) Pheonixian: Sacrifice G2 Ice
Build Y2 Pheonixian
Build Y3 Venus

37) Felix: Sacrifice Y3 Scale
Move Y1 Scale Pheonixian
Move Y2 Warship Pheonixian
Move B2 Scale Pheonixian
Catastrophe Pheonixian Yellow
	Pheonixian: It makes sense, as this is the time when the most pieces are on the board and therefore the most options are available.

38) Pheonixian: Sacrifice Y3 Venus
Move R2 Ice Pheonixian
Move B3 Kale Pheonixian
Move G1 Ice Pheonixian

39) Felix: S R2 Scale
A R1 Pheonixian
A R2 Pheonixian

40) Pheonixian: Trade B3 R3 Pheonixian

41) Felix: B R1 Pheonixian
C Pheonixian Red
	Pheonixian: Hm, I didn't see that when I build the yellow ship. This is a pretty bad place to be in it seems; though I don't think I lose instantly.
	Felix: It's so easy to overlook stuff like that when the game gets complex. I do it often! It doesn't look good for you, but you should be able to survive a bit longer and hope I make a mistake!

42) Pheonixian: Trade B2 R2 Kale
	Felix: You always want to guard against losing control of red, though. I'm not sure there's much else you could have done though. I think you made the best move, given the scenario

43) Felix: S R1 Ramp
A G1 Pheonixian

	Pheonixian: It looks pretty bad and I don't really see a way out from here honestly. I'll keep playing a bit but I don't see myself succeeding in the end.
	Felix: Hey, that's okay. Don't be discouraged. I think you played very well for a first time! You will definitely be a very solid player after a few games under your belt. I'm happy to rematch any time!
	Pheonixian: I didn't expect to win my very first game against an experienced player, so I'm not discouraged I would say. I definitely have a much greater appreciation for the size of the learning curve of this game though :)

	Felix: It can be a bit overwhelming at times, but I'm happy to do what i can to give you pointers. If you want to rematch, I'm happy to play an even more casual game and just talk through it as we go.
