	Babamots: I don't think we need to play the rest of this out, do you? Would you like the satisfaction of crushing me, or do you mind if I resign?

	Babamots: Babamots is not a Trek reference, but all my system names are.
	mneme: I'm fine with a resignation here; it's not quite a 2 turn kill, but best case, you're left without any larges or red.
	Babamots: That's one win for you! No wins for me in this tournament yet. Too many mistakes.

	mneme: Thanks for the game!
