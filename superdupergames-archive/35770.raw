	Cuc: final blow with sacrificing r2 in cuc2 and conquering both yellow ships
	Cuc: Thank you David. You're doing much better already, because this was by far the longest and most memorable game we played. Note that some moaneuvres occurred twice. Extinction events cleared out the known universe but I gradually gained position that way. Points of attention: a.) keep your HW occupied with a large ship, b.) keep your ships out of harm's way by not moving where I can conquer them, 3.) think of discovering systems to "park" your excess ships.
	Cuc: Analyzing the game, at move 10 (see http://superdupergames.org/?page=archive_play&gid=35770&idx=17), I could have moved my Y3 over to your HW. Then, you'd have to build either Yellow or Red in your HW to prevent me from overtaking both your ships by sacrificing my R2. You'd be too late if you moved your R3 to my HW instead. But I would always sacrifice my R2 anyway, and conquer your red and whatever you built. Since I then have another R2 in your HW, I will then be able to conquer both your other ships, if you decide to build another ship in your HW. It would look like this: 
 
10. M R3 CUC CUC2; B R2 CUC2 //
11. S R2 CUC, A R2 CUC2, A R2 CUC2; B Y2 CUC2 //
12. S R2 CUC2, A Y2 CUC2, A Y2 CUC2; END 
 
This shows that I've got a lot to learn, to drag a game out 4 times its optimal length . . . apologies :-). 
In any case, it was fun!
