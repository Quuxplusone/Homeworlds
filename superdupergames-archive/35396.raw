Homeworlds Online (SDG# 35396)
Started: 2019.7.26, Ended: 2019.8.29
Participants: Draw5PlayAll (S), Babamots (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) Babamots: Homeworld R2 B1 G3
	Draw5PlayAll: Is this starting already?
 
My performance was awful last year. This time I will take things more seriously!!
	Babamots: I put in the rules that people could start playing whenever they're ready, but it's tucked into the middle of a paragraph. I should have said it somewhere more prominent.
 
I sort of think that the tournament *really* begins when I close registration (as I'm planning to do in a couple of weeks). That's also when I start making sure that everyone is participating consistently or asking them if they need to withdraw.
 
I have the first move, so it's my job to record this game with the tournament form.
 
Good luck here and on all of your games!

	Babamots: I'd never seen anything quite like it, so I was pretty pleased when I came up with it. Sort of a slow-motion doomsday machine. A doomsweek machine, maybe.
	Draw5PlayAll: Hopefully I do not get massacred this year like I did last year...
	Draw5PlayAll: I think last time my ONLY wins were speardane, one human, and a bunch of withdrawn players.
	Babamots: You actually beat *two* humans who stayed in the tournament last year and had one draw :-)
 
Good luck with your games!
