Cochise: Hey there. This looks like a fun game. I only have one TreeHouse set so far, but wanted to try the game out to get a better grasp on the rules. Nothing like a few games of actually playing to help solidify some learning.
TwoShort: Well, I certainly think it's a fun game, but it does have a bit of a learning curve. I don't know if it was intentional, but one thing to note is that by choosing both the same size stars as me, you've put us in a "small universe", with our Homeworlds only 2 moves from each other. Not necessarily a bad idea, but it does make the game more quick and brutal.

6) Cochise: Build Y1 Cochise

7) TwoShort: Trade G1 Y1 Twoshort
Cochise: Hmm, now I'm confused. I thought that travel between stars had to be of different sizes, so by choosing the same size as you have I was making the trip longer. Did I read or understand that rule wrong?
TwoShort: We can each move from our homeworlds only to 3 point stars, and from there to the other homeworld. If you had chosen a 1 and a 3, we would still not be ajacent thanks to the 1s, and I for example, would have to go to a 3 then a 2 then to your world.
