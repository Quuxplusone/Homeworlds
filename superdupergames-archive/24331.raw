Winner: Broccoli_Commander

1) Broccoli_Commander: Homeworld R1 B2 G3
	wil: I think I am beginning to learn...  unless I screw up on my game I should be climbing the ladder a bit...

2) wil: Homeworld B3 R1 G3

3) Broccoli_Commander: Build G1 Broccoli_commander
	wil: did I somehow goof up and put us in two games?

4) wil: Build G1 Wil
	Broccoli_Commander: Yes it looks like it, I'll just let the other one die...
Anyway, looking forward to seeing wil 2.0 ;)

5) Broccoli_Commander: Trade G1 Y1 Broccoli_commander
	wil: ah...too bad...I was gonna suggest we start out the same and see how a change in choice somewhere creates a totally different game...

6) wil: Trade G1 Y1 Wil

7) Broccoli_Commander: Build G1 Broccoli_commander

8) wil: Build G1 Wil
	Broccoli_Commander: Oh... Well it's not a bad idea, but I wouldn't know when to make a change to get a meaningful result... This particular opening is pretty common so for instance any early change will simply yield two different games
	wil: I don't think it would be an intentional change....as the two games played out one of us would make an adjustment to strategy and a new game would be developed...   hmmmm  that makes me think... we should pick openings and have a lot of people play the exact same openings..and switch sides...and see the variety of games that are created...
