Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2006.8.19, Ended: 2006.8.21
Participants: eugman (S), zoltar (N)
Winner: zoltar

1) zoltar: Homeworld R3 G2 B3

2) eugman: Homeworld B2 G1 Y3

3) zoltar: Build B1 Zoltar
	eugman: I've never played before so feel free to point out any blantantly bad moves.
	zoltar: Ok. Your start was excellent: the two small stars is considered the strongest opening move.  I usually start with that one, but now that I've been playing for a couple of months I'm experimenting with new openings, such as this one with a red star and a blue ship, which I've never played before.

4) eugman: Build Y1 Eugman
	eugman: Experiment away. It might work as a bit of a handicap. The hints I've been able to find so far think starting with red is bad since you don't use it for a while.
 
Then again it could provide for a constant defense so what do I know.


5) zoltar: Trade B1 Y1 Zoltar

6) eugman: Trade Y1 B1 Eugman
	zoltar: Yes, usually gby should be your starting colors, and red gives the other player an opening advantage, but it is strong for defense later in the game.

7) zoltar: Build B1 Zoltar

8) eugman: Build Y1 Eugman

9) zoltar: Trade B1 G1 Zoltar

10) eugman: Build B1 Eugman

11) zoltar: Build Y1 Zoltar

12) eugman: Build Y2 Eugman

13) zoltar: Discover Y1 Zoltar G1 Greenbelt

14) eugman: Trade Y1 R1 Eugman
	zoltar: Remember not to build a 4th ship of any one color in the same system or they will blow up.

15) zoltar: Build G2 Zoltar

16) eugman: Trade Y2 G2 Eugman

17) zoltar: Trade G1 R1 Zoltar

18) eugman: Discover B1 Eugman G3 Flapjack
	eugman: Hmm, building anything new would give you an advantage, correct?

19) zoltar: Discover G2 Zoltar Y1 Yellowstone
	zoltar: Yes and No. For example, if build red, so do I but you can build red again, and I have to move a red ship out to build another one, so it's even.  You can always move a piece to a new system though, in a situation like this, as that is always a safe option.

20) eugman: Build Y2 Eugman

21) zoltar: Build Y2 Greenbelt

22) eugman: Move Y2 Eugman Flapjack

23) zoltar: Discover Y1 Greenbelt G3 Greendale

24) eugman: Trade Y2 R2 Flapjack

25) zoltar: Build Y2 Zoltar
	eugman: The planet of flapjack shall crush your obviously named planets!

26) eugman: Build Y2 Eugman

27) zoltar:
Build Y3 Greenbelt

28) eugman: Move Y2 Eugman Flapjack
	eugman: I really want to make that last yellow but I think you could force a catarophe if you wanted. Right?
	eugman: Sorry for spelling errors. Happens if I type too fast.
	zoltar: Yes, I'd move my y1 into your homeworld and BOOM!

29) zoltar: Build Y3 Greendale

30) eugman: Build B1 Flapjack

31) zoltar: Build B2 Zoltar
	zoltar: You may want to undo that -- I'll wait a few minutes, as I can sacrifice my R1 in my homeworld and take your R2 in Yellowstone, just as if my G2 had been an R2.  You lose the piece for nothing.
	eugman: Hmm you are right. I sometimes forget about some of the more indirect stuff you can do.

32) eugman: Build R1 Eugman
	zoltar: Btw, that's why you always need to get a red ship once your opponent has one: had I no r1 to sacrifice, your R2 could chase me around and capture pieces at will.

33) zoltar: Move R1 Zoltar Yellowstone

34) eugman: Move B1 Flapjack Greenbelt

35) zoltar: Build R2 Yellowstone

36) eugman: Move B1 Flapjack Greenbelt

37) zoltar: Sacrifice R2 Yellowstone
Attack B1 Greenbelt
Attack B1 Greenbelt
	zoltar: Of course, you can't capture a bigger ship than your own, only one of equal or smaller size, even with a sacrifice.

38) eugman: Build R2 Flapjack
	zoltar: I don't know if your blue move will work, but it's definitely the type of move to look for; if I capture it, then you could make your red move.
	eugman: No but I can do something else. Then  again you are too smart to fall for such a simple trap.
	zoltar: This second blue move looks more dubious, but it does make threats...

39) zoltar: Trade Y2 R2 Greenbelt
	eugman: Well unfortunately I've got some stuff to take care of so my losing will have to wait till monday.
	zoltar: I'd expected you to grow a b2 in flapjack instead, and then if I captured the b1 move the other b1 in.
	zoltar: Ok see you then

40) eugman: Move B1 Eugman Flapjack

41) zoltar: Move B1 Greenbelt Greendale

42) eugman: Move R1 Eugman Greendale
	eugman: Was that an accident or did you realize some grave error you failed to notice?
	zoltar: It was an accident: I had decided to trade the y2 for b2 before, then when I looked at it now I thought about moving a blue ship out, and as soon as I did, I remembered my original plan -- no grave error or anything like that.
	eugman: Hmmm should we contine? It's very clear that I'm trapped. I can't really ault any of your areas since my only three has to stay back and guard. I could make a new system but with the limited colors in the new system I'd still be in a very weak position. Do you want this to be carried out to it's end?
	eugman: Hmmm Looks like I'm done for tonight. Basically I'm asking if there is much left for me to learn by finishing a doomed endgame.
	zoltar: Up to you.  I have the advantage, but I haven't won yet.  You may want to play it out.  Whenever you think there is no hope, you can resign and we can start another if you'd like.
	Keith: Hello eugman and zoltar,
 
Eugman - I was going to take up your learning request if a day went by without someone else taking it up.  Zoltar has quickly risen to become one of the strongest Homeworlds players.  Given his material advantage there is probably not much left of this game as a competition.  As a learning exercise the game is not over.  Though I am not going to point out my ideas unless it is okay with Zoltar.   --Keith
	zoltar: That's okay with me, and yes, I would play on as an exercise.
	eugman: Ok, I'll keep playing then. I'll figure out my next move in the morning.

43) zoltar: Sacrifice G2 Yellowstone
Build R3 Yellowstone
Build R3 Greenbelt
	eugman: or I could do that. I'll see how that works out.

44) eugman: Sacrifice R2 Flapjack
Attack Y1N Greendale
Attack B1N Greendale
	Keith: I think eugman's assessment is right that with only one 3-pointer there is not much opportunity for offense.  I believe there is a way for eugman to secure an r3 in two moves and possibly two r3s in four moves. Assuming Zoltar isn't able to intiate a game ending attack in the next move or so.
 
What happens if eugman moves an r2 from flapjack to greenbelt?  It seems to me that zoltar must attack the r2 with his r2 in greenbelt to avoid having his r2 attacked and converted.  Then eugman can build an r3 in flapjack.  Zoltar can create a red catastrophie in flapjack by sacrificing the y2 in zoltar and moving the two r2's from greenbelt to flapjack.  Eugman loses two ships, Zoltar loses three and is down to one red ship.
 
Alternatively if eugman moves an r1 from eugman to  greendale then zoltar must sacrifice a red ship to attack it or face attacks on the b1 or y1 in greendale.  Whether Zoltar attacks the r1 in greendale or not eugman can now build an r3 in eugman.
 
Combined these two sequences might leave Zoltar with no red ships.  I might be wrong. I am not as strong a player as Zoltar.

	zoltar: Actually, if eugman moves an R2 to greenbelt, I would simply sacrifice my own R2 in greenbelt and capture the R2 and pass, rendering the situation the same as now, except for one of eugman's R2's being in the stash instead of in flapjack.
	Keith: One thing eugman should keep in mind is that zoltar's red star in his home system can only attack one ship per turn.  If eugman can move in enough ships in one turn into zoltars homeworld so that one survives then that ship can grow more of its kind and create a catastrophe in Zoltar's homeworld.  The best color to do this with is red, the one color area eugman as an advantage in.  For example if eugman moves that r2 from flapjack to green belt and Zoltar does not attack it then eugman will attack and get two r2s in greenbelt.  Sacrifice a y2 and move both r2s to zoltar's home system.  The red star can only convert one r2, the other grows an r3 and boom, red catastrophe.
 
Sorry to be so wordy. 

45) zoltar: Sacrifice R2 Greenbelt
Attack R1 Greendale
Attack B1 Greendale

46) eugman: Sacrifice B1 Flapjack
Trade Y1 G1 Greendale
	eugman: Greendale Shall crumble and fall!

47) zoltar: Discover Y3 Greendale B1 Greenhills
	eugman: Oh wait, comments. I should have read those.
	eugman: Oh and wordy isn't too much of a problem. As long as you are clear and remeber to avoid the giant paragraph of doom.

	eugman: Yes, please make a large and entirely ignore my ship in your system.

48) eugman: Build Y1 Flapjack
	zoltar: Not a bad move, btw -- made me think.  Ok, I sacrificed my only green piece (not something I like to do) to get maximum firepower, so you can only target one of my three bases at one time.  Your puny ship will be dealt with later. [Insert Evil Overlord Laugh here]
	eugman: Yes I thought it was rather clever. You either have to ignore my tiny ship in your system or basically do the equivalent of moving one of your small reds over there and make it harder to get three sized reds.
 
Now I just need to decide if I should capture something or cower in fear.

49) zoltar: Trade B3 G3 Zoltar

50) eugman: Build G2 Greendale
	eugman: I think that was a better move since you can't rebuild that r2 right now without risking a catastrophe and you can't just sace a red to get total control of greendale.
 
Let me know if I make some error in my thinking.
	eugman: I mean you can't sacrifice a medium at least.
	zoltar: No, it was reasonable.  The other choice was to sac your y2 and send your r1 and one of your  r2's into either greenbelt or yellowstone and destroy my reds there.  That's why I sacked and built an R3 in each one, as either sac and you are vulnerable with me still having an R3 left.  Now I probably have to sac an R2 or something to deal with this latest incursion.

51) zoltar: Build B2 Greendale
	eugman: I'm really not sure if what I'm about to do is a good idea but it's worth a shot. Please let me know if it has any merit.
	eugman: Oh wait, nvm I don't have a red in greendale.

52) eugman: Sacrifice G2 Greendale
Build Y2 Eugman
Build R2 Flapjack
	zoltar: Yes, I sacked my R2 to take your R1 in greendale.  I sacked the R2 rather than the R1 in yellowstone because I figured it would be useful to have the blue, and I could get both in one turn.  Of course, you can build reds again, but now I can also build a red in greendale.
	zoltar: Now that is downright sneaky, trying to blow up the nice town of greendale (and I haven't even built greenhills yet)! Ok, how can I save my green star -- I'll have to think about this.

53) zoltar: Attack G1 Greendale
	zoltar: 
	zoltar: Nope, that won't work either.  You've made a good move.
	eugman: How unusual.

54) eugman: Build R2 Eugman
	zoltar: Ok, we're heading for the hills.
	eugman: Hmm, you took that small blue I wanted. I'm going to have to think about this a little bit. Also I see no green on your not-obviously-named new colony.

55) zoltar: Sacrifice G3 Zoltar
Build B3 Zoltar
Build B3 Greenbelt
Build B3 Greenbelt
	zoltar: Well, it was going to be green, but I figured it was a better move to take that blue you wanted; and now I have the three "garden city" towns built by FDR in the 30's (I live in Greenbelt).  Google all three of them together to read the cool story.

56) eugman: Sacrifice Y2 Flapjack
Move R2 Flapjack Greenhills
Move R2 Flapjack Greenhills
	eugman: Well that ruins my plan. I thought you were going to change the yellow to green. Hmmm,

57) zoltar: Build Y2 Greenbelt
	eugman: I thought greendale was connected to your home and I could force you to sacrifice your three. Now I need to ponder.
	eugman: Heck why not.

58) eugman: Move G2 Eugman Flapjack

59) zoltar: Move B3 Greenbelt Flapjack
	zoltar: oops, mistyped that

60) eugman: Move G2 Flapjack Greenhills

61) zoltar: Sacrifice R3 Yellowstone
Attack R2 Greenhills
Attack R2 Greenhills
Attack G2 Greenhills
	eugman: Run away!!!!!
	Keith: Wow.  The game did go on... and on.  I am not sure if that had anything to do with my ideas.  Eugman, do you feel like your learning anything (since that was your goal)?  Keith

62) eugman: Trade R2 G2 Eugman
	zoltar: Eugman has come up with some very good ideas on his own and has really made me think, though I still have maintained a material lead.
	eugman: Yeah, I even got in a few clever moves. The whole game was annoying though because for most of it I felt like my back was up against the wall.
	eugman: Zoltars, post wasn't there when I was typing this. Ok keith I'm ready to magically defeat zoltar. Quick ! Your insightful move that will let me win in 5 turns is needed.

63) zoltar: Build G3 Greenhills

64) eugman: Build R2 Eugman
	zoltar: Blue squadron reporting for duty...
	eugman: Hat I'd give for a blue.
 
Also, is there a way to look back through the comments?
	eugman: You know zoltar, it's clear I'm going to annilate you. You should clearly resign now before it's too late. 

65) zoltar: Build R3 Greenbelt

66) eugman: Pass
	zoltar: Well, I can always use another yellow ship
	eugman: Hmmm, it won't let me send my two ships to your place and immediately after cause a catastrophe.
	eugman: oh wait.....
	eugman: Ok, now I just feel dumb.

67) zoltar: Sacrifice Y3 Greenbelt
Move G2 Greenhills Greendale
Move G2 Greendale Eugman
Move G1 Greendale Eugman
Catastrophe Eugman G
	eugman: Hey, you should um... move a red back into your base. Image the havoc that could happen if it had nothing there to protect it. Um, yeah that's it.
	zoltar: If you make this move, I can sacrifice my y1 in Zoltar (or a y2 and make another movement as well) and move my g1 from greendale to your homeworld and blow up your green ships and your green star, in which case you would be in serious trouble.  If  you want to have any chance, you need to undo this move!
	zoltar: Ironic that it's your homeworld star that you've put in danger, not mine.  Btw, with a red star, all I need is a 3-size ship of a different color in my homeworld, and no red ships.  If you moved 2 ships into my homeworld, I'd sack an R3 and capture them both.  
	eugman: Twas but a joke. If you moved back a red I could probably make your star asplode. And really I think cleverness has come to an end. Does it really matter if I endanger myself now instead of losing in 8 or so turns?

68) eugman: Sacrifice Y3 Eugman
Move Y2 Eugman Greenhills
Move R2 Eugman Greenhills
Move R1 Eugman Greenhills
Catastrophe Greenhills Red

	eugman: How often does a two player game end with no pieces?
	zoltar: Or two moves, if you consider a move to be one move by each player, like in chess.  This is an important endgame trick, even if you don't have an overwhelming advantage.  You set things up so with 2 successive yellow sacs you blow up the two homeworld stars. It's important in a close game if after you blow up one star, the opponent can move into your homeworld and threaten to win. You then blow up the other star before he can capture anything.  
	zoltar: I've lost games where I have no pieces left, but I don't know how often it happens; besides, you're going to have your y1 left, since I don't need to waste time capturing it!
	eugman: I thought I'd lose in style.
	zoltar: Good game.  I'll play again later if you wish.
	eugman: I mean how often does the stash get emptied during the endgame.
	zoltar: Oh, not that often.  Maybe about 10-20% of my games all the pieces were used at one point.
