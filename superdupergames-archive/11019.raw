mneme: um Oddly enough...
mneme: And yeah, the yellow lockout was nasty -- though taking advantage of your blunder was arguably moreso.

Keith: Wow, way to go. Nice lesson in factoring in the possibility of your moving your 3-pointer out. Alas, I was never in this game enough to give you a challenge. I will be back for a re-match after I learn to think Homeworlds again.
mneme: Looking forward to it. Meanwhile, Andy challenged me to a game at Origins; will have to see how it goes.
