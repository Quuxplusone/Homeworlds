zoltar: Then you shouldn't have built the 3rd Yellow ship, and instead could've moved one of your yellow ships to a new star! Now you are in big trouble, as if I can build a 3-sized ship, get it to your homeworld, and make a red ship before you can DOOMED. So the race is on...
Laurie_Menke: Not a problem, oh violent alien friend. ;o)

22) Laurie_Menke: Build B1 Laurie_menke
Laurie_Menke: Of course, you're probably about to repeat the catastrophe, but it'll cost you, too. ;o)
zoltar: Don't you ever learn? <sigh> Primitive hyu-maahn beanz!

25) zoltar: Trade B1 G1 Zoltar
zoltar: Btw, I think you'd really enjoy a game with 'eugman'. He just played his first two games (he lost, and the second very badly), and told me he's looking for players he has a chance with. His third game he's playing much better, and I think he'd give you a run for your money, though you'd have the advantage having more experience. You ought to challenge him to a Homeworlds game. You can look at our game in progress as well.
Laurie_Menke: LOL...I *think* I'll take that as a compliment. ;o) And thanks for the tip...I'll challenge him right now. :o)

zoltar: Hey, after this do you want to play Pikeman? Like Homeworlds, it's author is someone I know in person, but unlike homeworlds, I have no idea how to play. I'm playing my first game now, and and already way behind after about 5 moves. It looks like a fun game though, and I want to learn how to play.
Laurie_Menke: Sure, I'm happy to play with you. I've played a few games, but I pretty much suck at it, too. You'll probably be beating me in no time. ;o)
