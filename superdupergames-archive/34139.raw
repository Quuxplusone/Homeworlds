Homeworlds Online (SDG# 34139)
Variants: "Unrated, Hard time"
Started: 2018.5.14, Ended: 2018.6.2
Participants: Babamots (S), Felix (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) Felix: Homeworld R1 B3 G3

2) Babamots: Homeworld Y2 B1 G3
	Felix: And they're off!
	Babamots: Good luck! You'll notice that my first move in the other game is different your first move in this one, so I can't just make you play yourself and ensure that I win a game :-P.

3) Felix: Build G1 Felix

4) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots
	Felix: Haha, much appreciated!

5) Felix: Trade G1 B1 Felix

6) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots

7) Felix: Build B1 Felix

8) Babamots: Discover G1 Babamots B3 Bajor

9) Felix: T B1 Y1 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: I may be mistaken, but I think that if such a thing happened, the "victim" could do something involving the clock and end the scheme before it gets off the ground.

10) Babamots: Trade G1 B1 Babamots
	Babamots: Ooh, run the time down to just an hour and then make a move just before time ran out so the opponent would only have seconds. Devious.

11) Felix: Build B2 Felix

12) Babamots: Build B2 Babamots
	Felix: Doesn't the opponent still get 7 days, or however much time they had before, even if the opponent runs down the clock?

13) Felix: Discover B2 Felix B2 Bleeb

14) Babamots: Trade B1 R1 Babamots
	Babamots: OK, so say Alice is playing two simultaneous games with Bob. Alice is basically cheating by transferring Bob's moves from game 1 into game 2 and vice versa (she waits for Bob to make a move in game 1 and then makes an identical move in game 2 etc.). Let's say they've played enough moves that all the timers are maxed out (say at 7 days).
 
Bob gets annoyed and decides to put a stop to it. It's Bob's turn in game 1 and Alice's turn in game 2. These two timers are ticking away. Bob waits until there are only a few seconds before timeout. He is about to timeout in game 1, Alice is about to timeout in game 2. Then Bob finally makes his move in game 1, and Alice only has a few seconds to see his move and copy it over to game 2 before her time runs out. In case she doesn't make it, Bob should be ready to hit the "force resignation" button. If she does move in time, Bob can just do it again the next move. It would be tiresome for both players, but I think it's harder on Alice, who has to keep refreshing at the end of the timer to see if Bob has moved yet.

15) Felix: Build Y1 Felix
	Felix: Ohh, I see. Makes sense. That would be an awful lot of trouble to cheat, haha. Major props to whoever would have that much patience!

16) Babamots: Build R1 Babamots

17) Felix: B Y1 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: But what if neither one can really guarantee that they get on in time? I think such a thing would benefit Bob if "hard time" was on, and Alice would otherwise.
	Draw5PlayAll: Actually, wait. I forgot that Bob knows that the timer expires at end of hour, so he can simply make his move at XX:59:20 (or later depending on internet speed), and refresh the other game he wants Alice to lose in at XY:00:00.
 
Weird. Maybe someone should try this in Martian chess or a game like that. Anyone up for the challenge?

Discover Y1 Felix G2 Pinkros

28) Babamots: Attack B2 Babamots
	Felix: Nice move! You gave me a lot to think about and have sort of forced my hand.
	Babamots: It's sort of a Martian Chess type of move, offering a ship to the other player. Both of us want to get at the yellow but we already have too much in our systems. So, I like to push some more yellow at the other guy.
	Felix: I like to try and do the unexpected in situations like that. It usually ends up costing me the game, but hopefully I gave you something to think about here :)
	Babamots: Pretty interesting. I'll need to consider pros and cons carefully on this one.
	Babamots: Well, I sure wish I could look deeper at what each of my moves would do to the game, but I guess I'll just have to take my best guess.

29) Felix: S G3 Felix
B Y3 Felix
B Y3 Pinkros
B Y3 Bleeb

30) Babamots: Sacrifice R1 Babamots
Attack R2 Bleeb
	Felix: Don't worry. I don't know where my moves are going either! Guess we'll find out together :) also, my baby arrived! So have patience of my moves come a bit slow some days

31) Felix: S Y3 Bleeb
M B1 Felix Pinkros
M B1 Pinkros Bajor
M B1 Bajor Babamots
C Babamots Blue

32) Babamots: Build Y3 Bajor

33) Felix: S Y1 Felix
D Y1 Bleeb G1 Grook

34) Babamots: Discover Y3 Bajor G2 Pakled
	Babamots: Looking pretty grim. I don't mind too much because I think your y3 sacrifice (turn 14) that started my downfall was so clever. It doesn't feel like I made a huge mistake this time.

35) Felix: S Y3 Pinkros
M Y1 Pinkros Grook
M Y1 Grook Babamots
M Y1 Grook Babamots
	Babamots: Well, then again maybe I have a last-minute chance to stab you from the grave. I guess I'll wait and see what you come up with.

36) Babamots: Sacrifice Y2 Bleeb
Move G3 Babamots Felix
Move Y3 Pakled Felix
	Felix: No, I think I miscalculated... Well done! I was just one piece short.

37) Felix: A Y3 Felix
	Babamots: Now, while SDG doesn't allow self-elimination, it's not something I addressed properly in the tournament rules. I remember reading somewhere that Andy believed in allowing mutual elimination for a draw. If we get that ruling from an official source, do you feel like a rematch? Or have I been a slow enough pain to play against that you just want it to be over? :-P
	Babamots: It was on BGG:
https://boardgamegeek.com/article/21140352#21140352
	Felix: You haven't been a pain at all! I can leave it up to you as the tournament organizer, since it wasn't really addressed up front. Draws are always a bit sticky in homeworlds and aren't really clear in the rules. But since Andy said that mutual destruction is possible, I'm fine with a rematch!
	Felix: Technically I could call a catastrophe on you "during" my turn, but then my turn would end and I'd have no ships, so I think a draw seems reasonable here, if that's okay with you
	Babamots: SDG won't let you abandon your homeworld to make the move will it? Have you tried? And I can't remember if there is an "offer draw" button for HW. Do you have one?

38) Babamots: Sacrifice R2 Bleeb
Attack Y3 Felix
Attack Y3 Felix
	Felix: Nah, it won't let me move it anywhere, and I don't have a draw button either
	Felix: If the tournament is being played by SDG rules, then, I'll just take the loss, no worries
	Babamots: Since I wasn't careful enough with the tournament rules, a win for me here would certainly need an asterisk by it. A draw is the most sensible thing in this case. I was very reluctant to admit that for two reasons:
 
1) I'm quite emotionally invested. I'd really like to win :-D.
 
2) I don't personally like the "simultaneous elimination is a draw" ruling since it creates a weird exception in the rules (like allowing someone to move into check, but only when it checkmates the other player).
	Babamots: I'll mark it as a draw in the bracket, though I'm happy enough to take the win on SDG records.
	Babamots: I made a post about the draw on Facebook, so it must be official :-P.
	Felix: So in theory, I just shouldn't have been able to move my yellow at all, just like SDG handles it. Basically if a move ends up in your own destruction, you can't make it. I do think that's a cleaner way to play overall, but I guess we do need to abide by Andy's rules. As it is, it's a bit more like chess, where you must be careful to only attack when you're sure it won't end in a stalemate. Clearly, I failed to have that much forward thinking here!
	Babamots: In the next tournament, I think I'd like to say a draw can only be by move repetition or mutual agreement. Even if it's not how John and Andy play, I think it's got to be how most people play as evidenced by SDG's implementation.
	Draw5PlayAll: I tried asking Aaron to add a draw button to Homeworlds but there was either a delay or the message went unread.
