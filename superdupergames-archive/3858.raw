zoltar: I was able to build 3-sized ships using the trick of sacrificing the g3 and b2 alternatively, and then building them again, so that I could get an R3 ship into your homeworld before you could build another 3-sized ship there to defend. Once someone gets a 3-sized ship in your homeworld and you don't have another 3-sized ship in your homeworld to defend, there is rarely any defence.

41) Wkr: Trade Y2 G2 Wkr
zoltar: Note that if you had any 3-sized ship in your homeworld, you could have simply sacrificed your R2 ship and captured my R3! However, without a 3-sized ship, your R2 was worthless, even if you retreated it to defend.
Wkr: Yes. I'm prolonging my agony. I must improve my strategy enough.

42) zoltar: Sacrifice R2 Wkr
Attack G2 Wkr
Attack Y1 Wkr
zoltar: I just lost a game to the 'World Champion' Andy Looney in person last week. I've never beaten him, and he does tricks like this that I never see coming. That is why I like the game so much -- the tactics are very complex.
zoltar: I'm leaving for an hour to eat dinner, but if you wish to start another game, I can play again after thast. Thanks for the game!
Wkr: Anihiliation. :D
