	OnePageWars: "They thought they'd march through Serenity Valley, and we choked them with those words. We have done the impossible, and that makes us mighty." - Mal as near as I can remember it.

35) OnePageWars: Build Y3 Onepagewars
	OnePageWars: Well, since I'm defending Serenity Valley, that would make me the Independents. I guess this is appropriate considering the unfortunate outcome of that fateful battle.

36) haukec: Sacrifice Y2 Serenity_valley

Move Y1 Serenity_valley Onepagewars
Catastrophe Onepagewars Y
	OnePageWars: Unless of course you plan to cancel project make psychotic psychics and cease war on the Independents rather than wipe so many of them out in Serenity Valley at unthinkable cost of life to both sides.

37) OnePageWars: Build Y1 Serenity_valley
	haukec: So much for the unthinkable cost of life to both sides ;)
I think, i will make an android-clone of this game :D

38) haukec: Move Y3 Nowhere Onepagewars
	OnePageWars: Though high command, having only 2 small ships in their home system, has surrendered, the Independents at Serenity_Valley shall still hold out for some three weeks. (Did I get the timeline correct? It's been a while since I watched the series.)
	haukec: To be honest, i don't know for sure too, but I will definetively watch the series again sometime soon :)

39) OnePageWars: Build Y1 Serenity_valley
	OnePageWars: Zoe: They're not coming. Command says it's to hot. They're pulling out. We're to lay down arms.

40) haukec: Move Y1 Haukec Serenity_valley
Catastrophe Serenity_valley Y
	OnePageWars: And btw, I looked it up and according to http://wiki.serenitymush.com/wiki/index.php/Battle_of_Serenity_Valley It was only two weeks that they held out after Independent High Command had surrendered.

	OnePageWars: "We're all just folk now." - Mal
	haukec: Thank you very much for this challenging and interesting match :)
	OnePageWars: The same to you. I very much enjoyed both the gameplay and the Firefly quotations with a little role play thrown in at the end.
	haukec: Half of writing history is hiding the truth. ;)
	haukec: btw, I started implementing the game in java, having this as an android app would be awesome :)
	OnePageWars: Yes, it would.
