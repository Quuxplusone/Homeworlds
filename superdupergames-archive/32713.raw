Variants: "Unrated, Hard time"
Started: 2017.7.11, Ended: 2017.7.20
Participants: Felix (S), dlwillson (N)
Winner: dlwillson

1) dlwillson: H R2 B2 G3 *

2) Felix: Homeworld Y2 B3 G3
	dlwillson: Strange that the engine forces confirmation for this, while being completely indifferent to forgone catastrophes.
	Felix: Odd indeed. I like the experimentation! You've presented me with a very interesting choice...

3) dlwillson: Build G1 Dlwillson

4) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	dlwillson: I wonder if b1 r1 would be strong or weak, in the end? I wonder if a yellow or blue starting ship would work well. Yellow seems like it would, but then you'd *have* to have a green star. Yuck. I'm not sure *why* it's yuck, but yuck.
	Felix: I do like the idea of starting with blue or yellow, but I can't stand having a green star! It just feels like a lot of toil to try and set up a factory. I do it sometimes to handicap myself against new players; but I really don't like it. I thought about using a 1-1 against this, but I kind of want to see how the 2-2 works against a fortress.
	Felix: In theory, 2-2 may be the strongest starting position, since it lets you block larges and move out to smalls if necessary. But it also forces a small or micro universe, which certainly has quirks. It's a totally different game when there isn't time to build up your fleet.

5) dlwillson: T G1 Y1 Dlwillson

6) Felix: Trade G1 Y1 Felix
	dlwillson: Could build the factory in another system. It's slower, but it could work.
	Draw5PlayAll: But if you go FIRST with the 2-2 then you have a tempo more. I like the blue-red stars since I can safely build yellow ships in the homeworld, and with a yellow star that gets risky. Colonies are hard to come by so I like to keep yellows at home.

22) Felix: Discover Y1 Out B3 Aegis
	dlwillson: I'm not sure ... what was supposed to happen?
	Felix: Oh, pretty much what just happened. I just thought it would be fun to force you to do the catastrophe instead. I just meant that attacking this soon is ill conceived.
