	dlwillson: You're playing perfectly! That was a hard choice!
	eliscinsky: Thanks. I lost all my games in the last tourney, but I try to learn something new about HWs every time I play. Learning the strategy is the hardest part, but there too I'm learning with each play/game.

	dlwillson: The only way to really learn this game is to get trounced a lot by stronger players. The branching factor is absurdly high, so you really have to memorize the sequences and forceful attacks that happen predictably, and learn to manage the bank. Managing the bank, setting up forceful attacks, and feeding your opponent vexing choices. That's this game. Huh, @Felix?
 
That probably doesn't work to tag him, but Felix and I spent many games where the first priority was to offer the other fellow an irritating situation. My favorite is top-banking a big that the my opponent doesn't have room to build, that I *do* have room to build. They want to build it, but they can't. They want to split up their ships, but by the time they split them, I'll already have an extra big, with which to irritate them. :-)

	Felix: I'm late to the conversation, but I'm with David. I spent many games getting whipped by him (and Wil, TwoShort, Endo, etc.) before I was finally able to hold my own against *some* of those players. After a large number of games you do start to recognize certain attack patterns, but even then, one little oversight can quickly cost you the game, as just happened to me over here! http://superdupergames.org/main.html?page=play_homeworlds&num=34431
	dlwillson: I wish TwoShort would come back. I think I might finally be good enough to compete with him. He's the strongest player I've ever played against, but there are other, older players who are supposed to be stronger, like Wyons and somebody else. Is TeeTeeTee still playing? He plays like a machine. No mistakes. No room given.
	eliscinsky: Okay explain to me how that worked? I had more Pips on my shifts then your B3. And yet you were able to sacrifice an R3 and defeats all my ships? I don't get it. Call me a newbie but it just sounds wrong.

51) dlwillson: A B1 Alpha
	dlwillson: When I sacrificed my R3, I got three attacks to use anywhere. Pips don't matter, except to determine whether a ship can successfully attack another ship. A large ship can attack anything and can only be attacked by other large ships. So, I was able to attack three of your ships with three attacks, one attack each.

	eliscinsky: Like cattle ... I feel like I'm being herded.  LOL
	eliscinsky: I really am enjoying this game.  I'm lasting much longer than in the past.
	dlwillson: Here's the biggest tip for your next game. The overall strategy: To win, you have to make your opponent lose. Constantly have a best plan in mind that ends with him or her losing and you winning. If you don't have that, you're probably playing to forestall losing, and eventually, that style of play usually loses. I'm entirely serious. It's very easy to spend the whole game thinking tactically, and wait for a winning strategy to appear. Don't do that.
 
*Always* be thinking, "If I do this, then this, then this, I win." It may seem obvious or trivial, but it's neither.

56) eliscinsky: Trade G1 R1 Eliscinsky
	eliscinsky: Yes, I see that NOW! LMAO!!!
