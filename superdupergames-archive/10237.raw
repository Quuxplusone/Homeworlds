84) Uglyfoot: Move R2 Uglyfoot Ariel
	smilingra: Please don't force Uglyfoot to surrender, as something went wrong and it now appears that he is out of time (when he in fact, is not).  This is due to a bug in the system, it appears.
	Aaron: Corrected.
	smilingra: Thanks, Aaron.  Also, alexcobo, I'm sure you'll appreciate my move.  Uglyfoot probably does not. :p
	alexcobo: Beautiful move! Your earned my gratitud for the rest of the game!
	Uglyfoot: Wow.  I had too many eggs in one basket.  And yes, smilingra, that was a good move.

85) spearjr: Build G2 Spearjr
	alexcobo: I will be out for a few days, starting Saturday, due to a surgery I need to have done. I once saw an automated message for a player that went out for a few days. Do you know how to set up a message like that?
	smilingra: Click on My SDG.  When that page loads, scroll down to User Information for alexcobo (it's the first line in red).  Below that, in small text, there are three links in parenthesis.  The middle one is Manage Aways.  Click on that and follow the instructions on the next page.  Hope that the surgery goes well and you'll be back playing soon!
 
Thanks for the compliments on my move.  I just hope that you won't return the favor. :)

	alexcobo: Fortunately for me the surgery was not necesary.
I am not sure how this works but, after East eliminated North. Wasn't my turn?

101) smilingra: Build G1 Zzz
	smilingra: I froze the game, because it does look like we skipped Alex's (South) turn.
	Aaron: So who's turn should it be?  That I can fix right away.  Please leave the admin page active so I don't lose track of the game, but I won't be able to fix the underlying problem for a little bit.
	smilingra: Well, we need to undo the last three turns, and then set it to South.  Aaron, can you do that, or do you need each one of us to undo our last turn?
	smilingra: Well, we need to undo the last three turns, and then set it to South.  Aaron, can you do that, or do you need each one of us to undo our last turn?
	smilingra: Oops!  Needed to leave the admin page button active!
	Aaron: Let me know if that didn't work.

102) alexcobo: Move Y3 Ariel Fort
	alexcobo: I eliminated East player (spearjr). Now it should be West player's turn (smilingra)
	alexcobo: And b1 ship at ariel and the system fort should be gone also
	Aaron: Sorry, I haven't been able to track down the fundamental problem.  I'll get this specific instance fixed and take a look at the code just as soon as I can.
	Aaron: Sorry, why should the b1 ship in Ariel not be there?
	spearjr: The ships should be gone because it belonged to the East seat. Which has been eliminated.
	Aaron: My reading of the rules does not say this.  Any remaining ships are left stranded and unable to complete any actions as their government has collapsed.  They are still open to attack.
 
Fixing the "Current Player" flag now...
	Aaron: Done.
