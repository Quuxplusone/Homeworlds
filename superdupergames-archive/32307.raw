	wil: My lowly little defense team has been highly concerned for a long time about being left behind with such responsiblity post that last big invasion and catastrophe...  he is pleased that the ole, you take one I'll take two has been initiated and prays dearly for its success.


	Felix: I guess it actually doesn't matter to much if you did or if I do it. Wow, this has been a fascinating game!
	wil: no kidding fun stuff and lol...I didn't want to catastrophe...i had some kind of plan for if you didn't do it to me...

	wil: and yeah...i love experimenting...every game is different but some can turn bizarre
	wil: That is an awesome end board...all pawns!!
	Felix: Awesome indeed! How did you manage to end yourself? The system usually won't let me do that.
	wil: I been buckin the system my whole life.
	Felix: This could be an interesting game for homeworlds theater...
	Draw5PlayAll: I think you guys should start using Altair, Betelgeuse, Caster (?), etc as your star names if you are considering trying to get your games on that show. I am not trying for that so I use my own name convention.
	wil: The names are changed for the show... Converted from whatever is used.
.there are two in editing and six chosen and in the pipeline now... 
	wil: And I appreciate you using my convention.. Are you also using why3, rtoo, gee1, bwon etc when stars duplicate?
	Draw5PlayAll: I used to use e.g. B3' and G2'' (that is two ' characters) but I switched to B3b and G2c.
	Felix: I'm glad there are so many shows in production! I'd also like to submit this recent game I played against ts52 (#32480). It's relatively short, but one of the most fascinating games I've played in a while. It ended with me only have a small red in my possession!

	Draw5PlayAll: "Two in editing and six chosen and in the pipeline" huh? What does this mean and where are you getting it from?
