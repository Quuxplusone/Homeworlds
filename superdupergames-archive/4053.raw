4) Keith: Build G1 Keith
antihero: I have played a few times in real life. I am still learning for sure.
antihero: You're the cannon expert, right?
Keith: I am probably considered a Cannon expert. Though part of my secret is simply looking farther ahead than my opponent. Dralius is a good teacher.

19) antihero: Discover G1 Next_one_over B3 Big_star
antihero: alright to bed with me. see you tomorrow.
Keith: I wish this were an unrated game so I could more easily point things out without risking my position. You can learn in an rated game but usually it is the hard way. I created that y2 so I could move a g1 into your homeworld and create a green catastrophe. I am okay with your taking your move back.
antihero: I think I already did before you wrote that? I think my new move is better? And I don't get any more undos. So let's see what happens.
Keith: You took back your move while I was commenting. So it works out well. That is the better move.

Pass
Catastrophe Keith Green
Keith: Well I had been pushing it by breking two rules of thumb. 1) if your opponent has a red you should too. 2) Don't have just one ship type at your homeoworld.

Keith: That and I could not get my own ploys into action before you got yours.

24) Keith: Move G1 Midworld Keith
antihero: hmmm tough decision, sort of.

25) antihero: Trade G2 Y2 Antihero
Keith: I thought so too. An expensive move for both of us.

antihero: alright to bed with me. see you later.
antihero: don't do anything too crazy while, I'm gone, ya hear? :)
Keith: Tomorrow then, eventually anyway. I have a 12 hour work shift to get through first.
antihero: oh rough, what do you do?
Keith: Assistant manager at a restaurant. Which in reality means 11 hours on my feet as a fry cook in high heat and humidity with no breaks or meals and an hour of counting money and paperwork at the end of the day.

antihero: that doesn't sound like too much fun, man. Have a good day anyways, though!

antihero: I'm learning that I'm not great at homeworlds. I think I see moves easier in RL, too, but I have a lot to learn.
Keith: I find that I play any game much better when I can think ahead by moving pieces around the board.

Discover G3 Sun Y1 Temp
Move G3 Temp Antihero
Keith: I did expect, given the way we have been doing away with both side's ships that you would have triggered the catastrophe first.
Keith: I felt kind of bad taking advantage of it. In an unrated game I would have pointed it out so you could take back your move.

51) antihero: Trade Y1 G1 Antihero
antihero: well, let's play some unrated after this so I can get better.
antihero: if you are willing, of course

52) Keith: Sacrifice R2 Keith
Attack R2 Antihero
Attack R1 Antihero
Keith: Very willing. I would rather focus on a mutually enjoyable game rather than rating points.
Keith: I am a bit weak in the end game as Zoltar and Eugman have discovered.

53) antihero: Build G1 Antihero
Catastrophe Antihero Green
antihero: twice in a row now I have beaten zoltar out of the gate and then had him come back and made some stupid mistakes and down I go.
antihero: i can drag this out :)

54) Keith: Attack Y1 Antihero
Keith: Go ahead and drag.

Keith: I took out one of Zoltar's home stars, had more ships overall, had more three pointers, and after a dozen turns of trying to wear him down I left only one ship color in my homeworld as I moved in for the kill and boom... lost to Zoltar when I should have won.

Keith: A very unusual game. Lets try another one.
