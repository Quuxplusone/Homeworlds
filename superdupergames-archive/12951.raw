Started: 2009.3.29, Ended: 2009.4.7
Participants: ts52 (S), pam (N)
Winner: ts52

1) pam: Homeworld Y1 B2 G3
	ts52: Have a good game! Hey, two different games with you at once. Should be fun!
	pam: how do i make a move on this game?sorry,i thought i was going to be an observer!

2) ts52: Homeworld B1 Y3 G3
	ts52: No problem, first you need to create a homeworld. You only do this once, at the beginning of the game, with the homeworld command. A standard opening is 'homeworld y1 b2 g3' which gives you a homeworld with small yellow and medium blue stars with a large green ship.

3) pam: Build G1 Pam
	pam: thanks!

4) ts52: Build G1 Ts52
	pam: now what?

5) pam: Build G1 Pam
	pam: 
	ts52: That's good.

6) ts52: Discover G1 Ts52 B2 Grover
	ts52: Now you can discover a new star, build another green ship, or trade one of your green ships for another color.

	pam: i'm sorry,maybe i can play this later after i watch some games
	ts52: No problem. It's a game probably best learned in person. I'm probably not the best teacher, but if you'd like to challenge me to an unrated game, any time, I'd be happy to try to answer any questions. My only problem with SDG is you can't tell the system to notify you of new messages in a game.
