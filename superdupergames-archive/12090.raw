TwoShort: Wacky - Here I was about to tell you that you're ignoring my "start with a green ship" advice, and that you shouldn't start with a blue except in the rare case the opponent takes a b1 star, which you also shouldn't do. But apparently you psychically predicted I'd typo my homeworld and flip the colors...
MrMoto: I see the trans-galactic psychomodulator orbiting my homeworld has met with success.

TwoShort: Not the way I expected you to grab the blue monopoly... Usually leaving yourself without a 3 is a bad idea, but I guess I can't get a red and get my 3 to your home world before you move a blue out and grow a new 3... Nice.

MrMoto: Well, I'm still learning and experimenting -- we'll find out soon enough if it was a clever move or a disaster.
TwoShort: It was clever as long as you get 3 in your homeworld before I do. Long term, I think green beats blue...
