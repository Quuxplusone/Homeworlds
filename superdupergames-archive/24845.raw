	wil: I thought I'd never get through the dead wood...it took me six months to get to 13...but got a few games in the ladder along the way...a lot of timing out and pushing folks who should be booted down behind me and gaining one slot at a time...

17) OnePageWars: Build Y1 Onepagewars
	OnePageWars: I think my main problem (besides falling behind in the tech race) was no having any size 2 ships to trade. Well, live and learn.
	OnePageWars: Not, not no. Not not not no. Not no, but not. I mean, it should be not. Not that it shouldn't exist. Just that it should exist as not. I give up.

18) wil: Build Y2 G2
	wil: Yes, it is imperative to attempt to keep up on each economy....get in the ones, as the twos will disappear and then the same problem may occur with threes...

19) OnePageWars: Build Y2 Ilikedogs
	OnePageWars: Do the ship sizes tend to increase in importance throughout the game and peak in the late-game? Because so long as you have at least one size three in every system you care about, they only thing the sizes are good for are sacrifices?

	OnePageWars: How do we know who's winning in this sort of situation?
	wil: This game can change control in a few moves, one missed opportunity and the other taking advantage is huge.   Some folks just count pieces, others will count pips and give an extra pip count for ever step away from your homeworld. But neither of these are real...how close are you to taking out a homeworld, how many positions do you have safe from catastrophe or attack...

	OnePageWars: I came to the conclusion that you were ahead because your 2 g3s strike me as more useful than my y3 and b3. The y3 could come in handy, but the b3 seems like a waste of a large.

	wil: you'd be amazed at what color changes can do...but yes you need a g3 for a factory and once you used one on a star I was determined to corner the market..

	OnePageWars: was it a necessary sacrifice or just a waste of a y2? I honestly don't know.

Trade R3 Y3 G2
Trade Y2 R2 G2
	wil: necessary....no...an option...yes....a bad move...I don't think so...we have to see how it plays out
	OnePageWars: I think I lost this from the time I let you get 2 of the g3 pieces and stuck the third in a planet.

61) OnePageWars: Trade B3 R3 Onepagewars

	wil: I like blues for this reason...  and yeah...build a g3 prior to using a G3 as a star...

	wil: awfully tempting that was....it would be quite the reboot...

	OnePageWars: oh. I think that's fatal.
	OnePageWars: I can't even grab up the y3.
	OnePageWars: good game wp.
	wil: the tempting was two greens in g3, while I'd lose my factory...if I headed that way I'd completely restock the bank with that Ilikedogs system...  but I was poised on heading in after blues or reds to take out your homeworld.
 
I do like B3s  they can be a game changer by sacking them for three color changes...cornering blues to me is a powerful strategy.  But having the only factory...for every one you build I build two...is quite an advantage.
	wil: good game, thanx  (I would have backed up my R3 and played to the bitter end...I like seeing how things play out and sometimes can take advantage of errors...have won more than once with a solo homeworld)
	OnePageWars: Yeah, I have so much still to learn about this game.
	wil: You aint th eonly one....I try to stay in 5-8 games so I can be beat in more ways!
	OnePageWars: It just seemed comparable to an endgame in chess where you have a king on g1 and they have a king on d5 with only queenside pawns remaining for both players and you're down the exchange with their rook on the 2nd rank.
 
Maybe it's not that bad, but that was my impression.
