20) Draw5PlayAll: Attack B2 Deanthebean
	deanthebean: Is there any rule to prevent repetitions here. I couldn't find one but I can't find an "offer draw option" either 
	Draw5PlayAll: As you are contesting my ladder spot, you have the obligation to resign if the game is drawn.

	deanthebean: That's highly annoying and I can't see a sensible alternative to repeating. 
	Draw5PlayAll: If you want the rating points, challenge me to a 2-mover and I can resign.
	Draw5PlayAll: Or else just ask our developer to make that change for future games.
	deanthebean: Thanks. I'm not that bothered tbh.
