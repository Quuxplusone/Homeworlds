23) ts52: Build R2 Ts52
	Draw5PlayAll: That was well-intentioned. You see, on the red planet we have a race of emotional, reactionary, and aggressive aliens that have a voice in our government and sometimes try to make decisions... like take over innocent "enemy" bases. The way I see it, they are not an enemy until they initiate conflict.
