58) mneme: Attack G1 Felix

	Felix: Yeah, I knew that attack would backfire, but it just seemed too fun to not try it :) Good game and way to capitalize on my blunder correctly!
	mneme: Good game and -very- challenging opposition until that blunder!
	Felix: Very good game! To be honest, I underestimated you a bit, since I've played very few games against you. I shan't do so again :)
	Felix: Underestimate you, that is.
	mneme: Heh.  I -do- have a championship; it's probably not that wise, although like anyone I make mistakes.  And excellent; it's good to be taken seriously.  
	mneme: http://www.wunderland.com/LooneyLabs/Origins/2011/gallery.html
	Felix: Nice! When was this championship? I didn't realize there had been real ones already. Were there a lot of participants? I thought it was a bit too tricky to get enough Homeworlds players in the same room :P
	mneme: This was in 2011 -- back when Looney Labs was still running "The Big Experiment" events at Origins.  I don't remember how many players we had for the Binary Homeworlds tournament--not that many, compared to, say, the fluxx tournament, but at least 8 or 10 (maybe more; this was a while ago).
	mneme: On the other hand, one of the participants was Andy Looney himself (there were some other strong players, but the finals was me and Andy).  
 
Fortunately or unfortunately, the player who scares me -most- isn't in this tournament (that being TwoShort; I've only beaten him once!)
	Felix: Ah, cool! Endo is another player I have trouble with who doesn't seem to be active anymore. Shame. I'd like to keep cutting my teeth on the better players!
	mneme: It's definately (for all of us) the way to improve!  Sometimes stressful, though!
	mneme: I also, BTW, ended up being one of John Cooper's two advisors in an exhibition match at Looneycon 1 (Will, IIRC, was one of Andy's advisors on the other side).  Pretty fun game, though a touch short:

I always forget the ning forurms exist, alas.
	Felix: Very interesting! Thanks for the link. I enjoyed following along with the game :)
	Draw5PlayAll: Do the other two have SDG accounts?
	mneme: Wil's SDG account is Wil; he's in the tournament and solid.  Andy does, in fact, have a SDG account, though I don't remember the last time I saw him play here.  
	Draw5PlayAll: Wait, so it was mneme + JohnCooper + ?? vs wil + Andy + ??.
Do the two ??s have SDG accounts?
	mneme: Ah, that was the version of the question I was dreading; I'm not sure.  You can ask Joshua D on ning, since I know you've responded to him there; I don't think I'm accquainted (other than that game) with the third player on Andy's side.
	mneme: And functionally, of course, it was Andy vs John -- the other four players were strategic advisors/helpers, but Andy and Coop made the final call if there needed to be one.
