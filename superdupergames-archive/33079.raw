	Draw5PlayAll: I feel like this is an easy draw for my side, but I would like to play this out and SDG does not have Offer Draw for Homeworlds games. (Perhaps you could email Aaron and see if there is a quick fix.)

65) ts52: Build Y1 R3
	Draw5PlayAll: You can never get more blue or more non-small yellows.

66) Draw5PlayAll: Move R3 G3 Zoe
	ts52: True, I'm curious how this one is going to end.

67) ts52: Move R2 Zoe R3
	Draw5PlayAll: Let me try this on for size.

68) Draw5PlayAll: Attack G1 Zoe
	ts52: That seems like it could be the beginning of the end for me

69) ts52: Move G1 Ts52 Gonzo
	Draw5PlayAll: Is it?
	Draw5PlayAll: I mean, I have 5 large ships and I need to defend 5 systems... letting you get either Y2 is extremely dangerous.

70) Draw5PlayAll: Move R1 R2 G3
	ts52: It's true. Letting me get a y2 would be bad for you. But letting you get a green isn't great for me either.

71) ts52: Move Y1 R3 Gonzo
	Draw5PlayAll: I see a thing that MIGHT get you a win, but it takes several turns to setup and I can defend before it happens.

82) Draw5PlayAll: Move B2 Zoe G3
	ts52: Yep. If you'd only let me get a medium yellow.... ;)
	Draw5PlayAll: But what could you do either way?

83) ts52: Move G1 Zoe R3

84) Draw5PlayAll: Move B2 G3 Bigbird
	ts52: Honestly, I'm not 100% sure. This may be a very long endgame.

85) ts52: Sacrifice G3 Zoe
Build G3 R3
Build Y2 Gonzo
Pass

86) Draw5PlayAll: Move B2 Draw5playall G3
	Draw5PlayAll: The only thing you could possibly do is try to sabotage me on the red economy.

87) ts52: Move G1 R3 Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: You have neither the blue nor the movement to blow both of my stars. I can hold the game eternally as long as you never take over R2, G3, or bigbird. Also G3 and my homeworld have reds in then and R2 is a red system, therefore you could only get me to waste red at bigbird (or by sending two ships in at once, which wastes your only Y2).
	ts52: Yeah, I'm really not sure what either of us should be doing at this point. Going to have to think on this one.
	Draw5PlayAll: I have no way at all to win or even make progress unless you let me. I cannot afford to throw another blue to G3 because you catastrophe it.

88) Draw5PlayAll: Attack G1 Draw5playall
	ts52: Here goes nothing.
