Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2017.7.25, Ended: 2017.8.21
Participants: ts52 (S), shoejitsu (N)
Winner: ts52

1) shoejitsu: Homeworld B3 Y2 G3

2) ts52: Homeworld Y3 B2 G3
	ts52: Welcome! Feel free to ask questions here, and let me know how much advice you'd like me to give. Unfortunately there is no notification for comments, so if you want to ask a question, do so, then make and undo a move so I'll get an email about it. :) Have a great game!

3) shoejitsu: Build G1 Shoejitsu
	shoejitsu: thanks for the help! I was trying to find this in the rule book but i dont think it's ever touched upon. What's the general purpose of the colors that make up the homeworld if they don't count as stars? This has messed me up so many times, since i assume that they count as stars and therefore i can build.

4) ts52: Build G1 Ts52
	ts52: They do count as stars. You can use the powers of all the colors in your homeworld, but only one per turn. So currently either of us can build (as you just did) or trade or move/discover.

5) shoejitsu: Build G1 Shoejitsu
	shoejitsu: weird... i must have mistyped my command when i tried to build in one of my other games. I had a b3 g2 homeworld with a y3 ship and it would not let me build a g1 on the second turn
	ts52: Ah, that doesn't quite work. You can use the power of a green star (homeworld or not) to build in that system, but you can only build the smallest available ship it a color that matches a ship you control in that system. So in your case you could only build the smallest available yellow ship.
	shoejitsu: ohhhh... got it. very important detail i missed XD

6) ts52: Build G2 Ts52

7) shoejitsu: Discover G1 Shoejitsu B1 Titan
	ts52: Very important detail, but a fairly common one. We should have a FAQ or Common Mistakes or something like that.

8) ts52: Trade G1 B1 Ts52
	Draw5PlayAll: Why do you both have a fortress (2-3)?
	shoejitsu: dunno, i made mine first :P
	ts52: Oh, whoops. I totally screwed up and stuck us in a tiny universe. My bad. 

9) shoejitsu: Trade G1 Y1 Shoejitsu
	shoejitsu: yeah, i guess that alright since ive never played a tiny universe

10) ts52: Discover G2 Ts52 B1 Grover
	shoejitsu: starting to understand how you can force the economy to allow you to build bigger pieces like you did. was unsure how you were able to build that g2 until i went back in the logs and counted the stash haha
	ts52: Good. Sorry about the tiny universe. But you'll soon see why it's generally considered a bad idea.

11) shoejitsu: Build G1 Titan
	shoejitsu: oh yeah ive already started to see it haha

12) ts52: Build B2 Ts52

13) shoejitsu: Trade G1 Y1 Titan

14) ts52: Discover B2 Ts52 G1 Kermit

15) shoejitsu: Build G1 Titan
	shoejitsu: So is it a general rule of thumb to alway discover a new star system with a blue and a green peice in it? Its kind of seeming like yellow and red should be saved for building and trading transactions... and that makes buying smartly pretty challenging haha

16) ts52: Build G2 Ts52
	Draw5PlayAll: Placing a green at a blue system or a blue at a green system lets you quickly expand and gather all of the technologies. I used to attempt to do both but in my recent games I can usually only fit one of those in (I tend to lose the green or blue economy).

17) shoejitsu: Discover G1 Titan B2 Gaea
	ts52: Generally speaking green and blue are pretty important in the opening, growth and discovery part of the game. Yellow and Red are more important in the mid and end game.

18) ts52: Build B3 Kermit

19) shoejitsu: Build Y1 Titan
	shoejitsu: well i just realized i have no blue ships :D

20) ts52: Trade B3 Y3 Kermit
	ts52: Yeah, I've frozen you out of the blue economy, for now at least.

21) shoejitsu: Trade Y1 R1 Titan

22) ts52: Build B3 Kermit

23) shoejitsu: Move R1 Titan Ts52
	ts52: I'm breaking a pretty standard homeworlds adage here, that is 'when your enemy get's a gun, you get a gun'. But I think I can afford to wait.

24) ts52: Trade G2 R2 Ts52

25) shoejitsu: Attack B1 Ts52
	shoejitsu: Yeah i was surprised you didnt draw right away but clearly you have an upper hand to assist you 

26) ts52: Sacrifice R2 Ts52
Attack R1 Ts52
Attack B1 Ts52

27) shoejitsu: Build G2 Shoejitsu
	shoejitsu: oy

28) ts52: Build B3 Kermit
	shoejitsu: i may or may not have had a sudden realization involving the construct functionality...
	Draw5PlayAll: Care to share it?

29) shoejitsu: Trade G2 R2 Shoejitsu

30) ts52: Trade B3 Y3 Kermit
	shoejitsu: Only that delaying building due to worrying about the enemy's ability to build larger pieces will only effect me negatively at this point in the game. It seems like I just need any pieces right now, regardless of whether or not the enemy controls a majority of the stronger ones

31) shoejitsu: Build G2 Titan
	ts52: Indeed. Although it can be important to limit your opponents ability to get larger ships in play, you always have to way that against what it costs you to do so.

32) ts52: Build B3 Kermit

33) shoejitsu: Move Y1 Shoejitsu Titan
	shoejitsu: how do you list multiple moves, like after a sacrifice? Im not sure what a carriage return is...

34) ts52: Trade B3 R3 Kermit
	Draw5PlayAll: Just press return. It will look like this:
sacrifice Y3 Altair
move B1 Altair Electra
move B2 Altair Electra
move B1 Caster Electra
catastrophe Electra blue
	shoejitsu: thank you. I just realized what i was trying to do was not possible, thats why it was telling me i have no more moves... this game is looking pretty over at this point
	shoejitsu: confused why i cant do this:
 
sacrifice g2 titan
move y1 shoejitsu kermit
build y1 kermit
catastrophe kermit yellow
 
i thought if i could use the stars power even if i dont control the system? its telling me i have no more actions but it seems right to me?

35) shoejitsu: Move Y1 Titan Gaea
	shoejitsu: ah shoot now i cant undo my move again.... ughhh

	shoejitsu: now i know only one undo per turn i suppose
	ts52: When you sacrifice, you can only use the power of the sacrificed ship. So sacrificing a green means you can only build. It lets you sacrifice a large or medium piece to get 3 or 2 actions, but they all have to be the action of the piece sacrificed. Hopefully that makes sense.

36) ts52: Build B3 Kermit
	shoejitsu: that makes total sense, thanks
	shoejitsu: couldnt you have move all you blue ships in to my homeworld by sacrificing a y3 and calling catastrophe then?

37) shoejitsu: Move Y1 Titan Gaea
	ts52: Yes, I could have. But I'm going for a slightly longer play.

38) ts52: Sacrifice Y3 Kermit
Move B3 Kermit Shoejitsu
Move Y3 Kermit Shoejitsu
Move B3 Kermit Shoejitsu

39) shoejitsu: Trade G3 R3 Shoejitsu

40) ts52: Sacrifice R3 Kermit
Attack R3 Shoejitsu
Attack R2 Shoejitsu
Pass

	ts52: Thanks for the game! I look forward to the next one.
	shoejitsu: good game, thanks for the help
