Back we are short universe!!!!
	wil: *ackk
	wil: Is this what you wanted?  Did you record the start to this game?  I'll be glad to play it if we have too, but a lot of people don't like short uni and if it was unintentional...
	bhorner: It was intentional.  I was a little worried that it might be a big advantage to the first player, but I haven't done it... hardly ever, and wanted to get you away from what you are used to.  :)
	bhorner: I will record the challenge, thanks for the reminder.

20) bhorner: Move Y1 Bhorner G3
	wil: That wasn't the best move, but I think I just discovered something about this game layoutm
	bhorner: were you saying mine wasn't the best or yours?  That last move I made really had me in a bind, I learned a lot about this layout on my last move.  I figured you knew a lot about what was going on, and that was why I was in such a pinch.  I didn't think I had any other choices than what I did.

21) wil: B R2 Wil

22) bhorner: Build Y2 G3
	wil: No, I was saying my move was not the best
	Draw5PlayAll: Discovered what? The ordering of stars?
	bhorner: No... more like yellow is much more important earlier, and if your opponent gets to a y2, you can have a max of 2 of any color in your homeworld.  There is a need to expand earlier, before trying to grow too much.
	bhorner: Sorry, my last message was posted thinking that wil had asked what I'd discovered.  Please others, keep your comments to a minimum.

	wil: at least now it doesn't look so bad.
	bhorner: If I had moved the little blue to your home first, you could have sacrifices your y2 to move your b1 and another ship both to be blue starts, draining the bank, so I couldn't cat your blues.  Was that part of your plan?  It was razor thin, with all my infos to squirrel that one out!  The hardest game I've ever played I think.  :)
	wil: I made a few mistakes early...it was a good game... I appreciate the ability to use the undo even thou the tourney organizers frown upon it...the locking things in with a movement coin is necessary in my opinion...good game.
