mneme: good game
wyons: oh it was a super game - I dont mind admitting that I totted up hours looking at it. You also taught me a bit- particularly the value of g2s. And I thought you stemmed off the blue monopoly attack masterfully. At the end of course you were stuck with a fork between developing blue or red and elected blue- I think developing red would also not have worked at that stage (because of what I could then do with blue). Thanks very much though, I really enjoyed it!
mneme: I'm glad. The endgame was a bit painful (yay, walking wounded), but yeah -- it was superb.

mneme: I love g2s, yeah -- they let you threaten larges without saccing your own larges -- which does -so- many things, even aside from, you know, the ability to get more larges.
