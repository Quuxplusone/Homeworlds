mneme: planning on making a move some time soon? /me is impatient. :)

mneme: BTW, trying MC as a 4p game is a good idea -- it's very different; lighter, and easier, as a multiplayer game than as a duel.

Attack G3 Mikeyarrum
Attack Y1 Mikeyarrum
MikeYarrum: Sorry about that. Sometimes I wait a bit before I take my turn, 'cuz I'm "not in the mood".

MikeYarrum: And I'm easily frustrated sometimes, but I kind of calmed down about MC and I'd heard it's different with 4 players.
mneme: It's ok -- I was just getting impatient because my brain was spinning circles in planning ahead -- witch is kinda stupid, but there it is.
mneme: It's ok -- I was just getting impatient because my brain was spinning circles in planning ahead -- which is kinda stupid, but there it is.

MikeYarrum: Doomsday device?
mneme: doomsday device = the setup for blowing up a player's homeworld in two moves. Yours was slower, but the same concept.

mneme: Good game -- again?
MikeYarrum: I'm always up for another game!
