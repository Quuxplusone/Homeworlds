	wil: all of these games are archived...need to build a program to extract them and put moves on data sheet to be compared and analyzed...various openers results...players rating...frequency of various ending attacks, etc.
	wil: I like that you play different openings, all learning to me....need to play more of them.
	Draw5PlayAll: Well, you do like to learn about people [through] the way they play.
 
I do not use blue teleportation very often... nor the blue sac in general... at May because I have a hard time getting that many blue ships (there are usually 3-5 in star systems anyway in late game).
