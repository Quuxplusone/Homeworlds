	Draw5PlayAll: First game, right?
 
Make sure you build a B1 before exploring. And it would be better to send the small itself out, because leaving your homeworld without a large ship can be dangerous.

5) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall
	Amuzet: Oh you can only build ships of the same color!
	Draw5PlayAll: Yeah. If you wanted to build say reds, you first have to trade for it, unless you started with a red (you didn't) or attack one of mine (which is usually impractical).
