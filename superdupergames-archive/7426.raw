	mneme: distance isn't always a showstopper -- it's not like transportation is the largest expense.  Children can be, of course.

13) TwoShort: Discover Y2 Twoshort B3 Bluonia
	TwoShort: I went to various cons "back in the day", but now I occasionally go to cons I can drive to for the day, (which these days means "in Denver"); but anything far enough away that you have to stay overnight is a radically different proposition in terms of budget and time away from family.  It's just not that kind of priority for me at this point in my life.  Come to think of it, even when I've driven to Denver recently, one or more old friends was a guest of honor...

	mneme: *nod*  If you haven't done Origins, it's worth doing when/if life intervenes less, as the big LL con.  And, of course, organized sf, gaming, and other styles have very different whys and wherefores.  (which isn't to say that I, as a fairly heavily con-going 30-something, don't have a bit much con on the brain, but then, I'm not planning on kids).
	TwoShort: Yeah, Origins is the one I would do if I did... I went once long ago when it was in Philadelphia, and before that I used to go to Disclave because that was the big Icehouse Games con... When it was Icehouse Games and Disclave existed :)

	TwoShort: My favorite Homeworlds strategy maxim:  It's better to be slightly ahead in a simpler game than slightly ahead in a more complex one.  Also, it's fun to blow stuff up :)
