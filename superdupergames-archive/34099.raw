Homeworlds Online (SDG# 34099)
Variants: "Unrated, Hard time"
Started: 2018.4.28, Ended: 2018.5.13
Participants: Babamots (S), wil (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) wil: Homeworld B2 Y1 G3
	wil: Is this it?  Do you think there is no way I can make a mistake now?
	wil: I'm assuming if I win this will be our tourney game...and if I lose the tourney game it will just be a game.

2) Babamots: Homeworld B3 G1 Y3
	Babamots: I didn't issue this challenge until I was positive you would win game #8. If you did happen to lose, then this game would just be for fun I suppose. Otherwise, I intend this to be game #9 of the bracket.

3) wil: Build G1 Wil
	wil: Perfect...makes sense...so if either win we have to win the game after...and if we win that...we are in a best out of three with Felix right?
	wil: any who...  good luck, have fun..  thx so much for facilitating this...it has been a blast.

4) Babamots: Build Y1 Babamots
	Babamots: Sounds like you expected another game after this one. Winner of this game plays Felix in a best of three for the championship.

5) wil: Build G1 Wil
	wil: I do...don't I?  if he beats either of us first round, we both have two losses...double elimination achieved.  If either of us wins...we are now at one loss each and it goes into the final playoff???  He is only the only undefeated right?

6) Babamots: Build Y1 Babamots

7) wil: Discover G1 Wil Y3 Y3
	Babamots: The loser of this game is out. The winner of this game plays a best of three with Felix (in the bracket, they're labelled games #10-12). Even if Felix wins game #10, the best of three goes on. It's not strictly double elimination.

20) Babamots: Trade Y2 R2 Babamots
	wil: lol, I am hoping I do!

21) wil: Discover G2 Y3 Y2 Y2

22) Babamots: Move G3 Babamots Betazed
	wil: I am so lousy about thinking about moves...I always plan on taking my time, considering options...and then when you play...I just make a knee jerk reaction!

	Babamots: I'm working on breaking that habit. I lose games when I pick moves at the bus stop.

26) Babamots: Build R2 Babamots

27) wil: Move R1 B3 Y2
	wil: While I try to look long and hard at moves...and still knee jerk... I think often my knee jerks are right and paralysis analysis doesn't help me...  What helps most is making the move and then looking at what I've done before I move the coin.    If we are to ever have live games, chess clocks will be a thing...in order for brackets to be completed in a weekend.
	Babamots: Sorry for the delay; it's been a stressful week.

28) Babamots: Trade R1 B1 Babamots
	wil: things happen....talkin to Felix, he has a second baby due in a couple weeks...he will be swamped whoever he plays.

	Babamots: I've gotten bored with always starting out with green ships, but my yellow experiment isn't working out well.
	Babamots: And I just haven't been very pleased with life in general for a while, so it's pretty hard to care about the game. You deserve to win more than I do.

30) Babamots: Move R2 Babamots Betazed
	wil: Sorry to hear that brother...

31) wil: D R2 B3 B2 B2
	wil: I thought you had some plan with the y opening, I know I've been beat by them, and also don't play them well.

46) Babamots: Attack R1N Wil
	Babamots: It's miserable to lose a game to mistakes. I know exactly where you're at. I didn't handle my last loss well.
	wil: This is a game of capitalizing on mistakes, the big and small...
	wil: Good luck

	Babamots: Sorry for being moody earlier. Neither the game nor anything else seemed to be going right.
	Babamots: See you next time!
	Draw5PlayAll: So where's is this game in the tournament schedule?
	wil: The semi final... Babamots goes in two a best of 3 with Felix...  You were worried about it going on to long, I am said it is over and hope the next one takes a year and a half or more!
	Babamots: The tournament is going on 9 months, so I would call it pretty long. I would prefer to have more frequent, shorter tournaments in the future. I'll recommend a straight round-robin for next time. The bracket is very slow because some games have to wait for others to finish.
