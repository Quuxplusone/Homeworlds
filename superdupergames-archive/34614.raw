1) Trydnt: Homeworld Y3 B2 G3
	Trydnt: For the homeworlds tournament

2) ts52: Homeworld Y1 B2 G3
	ts52: Have a good game!

3) Trydnt: Build G1 Trydnt

	ts52: Crap. Didn't build up enough time before vacation. My bad. Good game!
	ts52: Sorry I made it a disappointing one.
	Babamots: As far as I'm concerned, you can replay this for the tournament if you both want to. Only starting with 2d on the clock isn't in the spirit of "you can take a week off" that I intended. I want to change that next time.
	Trydnt: I'm happy to play it again. We're so few moves in recreating it would be a doddle. ts52 you back from vacation?
	ts52: I'm fine either way. Trydnt, if you'd like to have a proper game, I'll gladly replay my first move. But I'm also fine with calling this one for you. I should've paid more attention to the time. So I leave it up to you.
	Trydnt: let's do it
	Babamots: If you're agreed, go ahead and start a new game and record it like normal. I'll strike this one from the record once you have a new one started.
