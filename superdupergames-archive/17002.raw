39) dlwillson: M Y3 Dlwillson Phosphor
	dlwillson: Actually, you're doing a lot better this game. Rather than moving your G2 to a green planet and risking a catastrophe with supernova, consider sac'ing the G2 to monopolize blue. Or, start trading your blues for other things you might want.
	dlwillson: catastrophe with supernova is bad, even if I have to give up a battleship to do it.

40) Lurch: Move B1 Alpha Beta
	Lurch: Lurch: Patiently waiting...
	dlwillson: When the green bank is low, consider leaving a little green near your G3, so you can rebuild your G3 from it after a sacrifice.

41) dlwillson: T G1 B1 Phosphor
	dlwillson: Like that. I had two "extra" builds. The G2 build was needed to get me back to my G3, but I have a good place for it. Then, I could build a second R or a second Y. Before building a second Y, I made sure there wasn't an easy way for you to build both remaining Y.

42) Lurch: Build B2 Alpha
	dlwillson: ... or cat Y in my home system. I have the three Y, but you don't have an extra Y to throw.

45) dlwillson: T G1 R1 Fluor

46) Lurch: Build B3 Beta

47) dlwillson: Build R2 Fluor

48) Lurch: Trade B3 Y3 Beta
	dlwillson: I did that move to prevent you from sac'ing your Y2 to put both blues in and supernova the system, destroying my Y3. I'd rather have traded one of the greens in fluor for red to get another red spot. Next turn I'll probably do that. Gosh, you have a lot of blue, and I have ~none~.  Hm. How can you take advantage of that?  Maybe you could trade your B3 for something tasty. I can't build it, and trading for it in my home system would slow me down. I might move a ship to it. Anyway, it's a thought.

49) dlwillson: Sacrifice G1 Dlwillson
Build B3 Lumen

50) Lurch: Trade Y3 R3 Beta

51) dlwillson: Build G1 Dlwillson

52) Lurch: Build R2 Lurch
	dlwillson: Sorry I'm taking so long lately... Been busy/distracted.
	Lurch: t b3 y3 beta

53) dlwillson: Trade B1 G1 Lumen
	Lurch: 
	Lurch: I didn't mean for that to be a comment.

54) Lurch: Sacrifice Y2 Alpha
Move R3 Beta Dlwillson
Move R3 Beta Dlwillson
	dlwillson: So, I guess I can build it, I just have to be willing to sacrifice.

55) dlwillson: Sacrifice G3 Dlwillson
Build R2 Dlwillson
Build G1 Fluor
Build G3 Dlwillson
Catastrophe Dlwillson R
	Lurch: Well there go my plans for world domination

56) Lurch: Build B1 Beta
	dlwillson: OK, explain. To me, your first move looked much better than your second.

57) dlwillson: Trade Y1 R1 Dlwillson
	dlwillson: Again, I build a small green next to the big green anytime I can safely do so, so that later, I can sac the big green and have a little green to rebuild it from.

58) Lurch: Trade B1 Y1 Alpha

	dlwillson: Huh. I didn't notice you'd moved in on me. I suppose I'd better deal with that, rather than moving in on you, as I had originally planned.

Attack G3 Lurch
