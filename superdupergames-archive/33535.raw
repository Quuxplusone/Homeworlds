	Babamots: The lesson of the game might be that it can be easy for your opponent to gobble up your fleet if you don't have a large enough ship at each system.

	Babamots: My next planned move is to green catastrophe on Kronos by sacrificing my y3 at home. I would lose more than you, but since I have a material advantage, it's probably worth it.
 
You should probably move your r3 out of Kronos. You could move it to Remus for a quick little threat. I'll want to take a turn to get my y2 to safety, and then you could sacrifice a y1 to move your r3 to Ix.

59) Babamots: Move Y2 Remus Corrino

	smokeytroll42: Good game! I'm sorry for the long delay, but I've just been busy with life!
