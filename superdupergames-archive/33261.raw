	shoejitsu: ugh... thats a shame. had a busy few days and slipped my mind
	eliscinsky: Bummer, I never wanted a RESIGNATION. Would you be interested in trying  again?
	shoejitsu: I wouldn't mind another game, you can mark it however you want though. rules are rules!
	Babamots: It's fine with me if you'd both like to try again. Just fill out the start form like usual. It will temporarily break the tournament results grid, but I will fix it.
