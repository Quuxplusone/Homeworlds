Wheatberry: Hi & thanks. Still new to Homeworlds but it's a nifty game. I'll give it my best shot.

Jesse: Let me know if you have any questions. I'm always pleased to help a new player get oriented.

6) Jesse: Trade G1 Y1 Jesse

7) Wheatberry: Discover G1 Wheatberry R1 Algol

8) Jesse: Build Y1 Jesse

Wheatberry: Heh! I love that you get to name each new star system, instead of just getting something random.

9) Wheatberry: Build G1 Algol
Jesse: First tip: It is unusual to discover red star systems, especially early in the game. It makes it harder to develop, because the red doesn't do anything but give you limited local protection. The home system is kind of a special case, though. I happen to like that a red-blue system gives me a little more flexibility to go with either a green or yellow large defender.

10) Jesse: Build G1 Jesse
Wheatberry: Okay, good to know. I was just going with a "get a little of everything" strategy
Jesse: That's a good instinct.

Wheatberry: Heh. Sorry. Just realized I couldn't pull the same trick, lacking another green ship in my home system...

25) Wheatberry: Move G1 Algol Simula

Catastrophe Jesse Green
Jesse: It's better to have diversity at each system and spread out your ships of like colors, than to clump them. For instance, you could have moved one of the yellows to Simula, instead, so both Algol and Simula could have served production purposes. Being a red star, Algol doesn't help you diversify, which slows you down in the opening, but with both a green and a yellow ship there, it's not something you need to abandon.
