Homeworlds Online (SDG# 36826)
Variants: "Unrated, Hard time"
Started: 2020.8.2, Ended: 2020.8.24
Participants: Xaevith (S), Babamots (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) Babamots: Homeworld G3 R1 B3

2) Xaevith: Homeworld B2 R1 G3
	Babamots: How's it going? And how much advice would you like as we play?
	Xaevith: So like I'm familiar with the colors and how everything is connected I guess it's more so just mid-late game and overall strategy. I guess if you don't mind pointing out any really stupid moves I make and trying to give me some pointers where you see I might be "making mistakes" so to speak?

3) Babamots: Build B1 Babamots
	Xaevith: Also sorry it's going pretty good so far, thank you for asking! I just taught my wife how to play a couple new games I learned today. Just relaxing with some tea now.
	Xaevith: I hope your evening (or day depending on when you get back to this) is treating you well. :)

4) Xaevith: Build G1 Xaevith
	Babamots: I try to warn new players about the bad moves they should avoid, but historically, I've been bad at predicting when those warnings are needed (just when I think their move is totally obvious, they doom themselves). I'm much better at telling people why their moves are bad they make them. :-)

5) Babamots: Trade B1 R1 Babamots
	Xaevith: No worries, it might be hard to totally predict someone's next move based on what was put down. It's all Gouda, I think what is really lacking for me is just talking the meta.
 
Why do you start with red? Normally I try to go for a combo of YBG right away but I see people starting with red a lot... Is it somehow better to start with red vs yellow?
	Babamots: Red vs yellow homestars is the first topic in my tactics guide:
 
https://jpeterbaker.github.io/homeworlds/site/tactics.html
 
There are good arguments for red and yellow, but I generally like red best. Trydnt plays more than me and wins more than me, and he prefers yellow.

6) Xaevith: Trade G3 R3 Xaevith
	Babamots: You are currently experiencing the problem I mention in the last paragraph of the "Small star problem" section. Since you picked the same small star color as me, I'm about to get a medium ship extra quickly. You'll probably want to trade your g3 for r3 before too long so you don't get completely frozen out of red.
	Xaevith: ouch what a painful situation i've already placed myself in early into this game ahahahahaha I guess I should have anticipated a red approach my brain always gravitates towards yellow being important right away and I figured you were probably going to swap for that next overlooking that if you went with red I leave myself in that situation now
 
losing the big green is unfortunate and having a ship the same colour as my star system only adds to future catastrophe situations (which are extra unfortunate if it's my 3 piece) but I'm gonna have to see where it goes from here! 
 
thank you for pointing that out I greatly appreciated the info
	Xaevith: also wow your guide is really comprehensive, this is probably the best in depth site i've read about homeworlds so far!

21) Babamots: Trade B1 G1 Babamots
	Xaevith: Figure that was the best move before I get locked out of building blue ships? It's not like you need green very much since almost every star is green in our universe...
	Babamots: It's definitely good to get a blue ship at some point to make sure I don't run away with all of them.

37) Babamots: Build B3 Babamots
	Babamots: I think your better move was to cash in on your investment. You've got a lovely g1 in a y3 system that you could sacrifice to build a y3 ship.
	Babamots: You may still be able to undo your other move if you want to.
	Xaevith: i think the reason it was by itself though was because I moved the blue ship and with it being there now if i sacrifice that piece the blue ship will still be there preventing me from taking the y3 :(
	Xaevith: Unless there's something else I can do here? But I was trying to move for that now since yellow has been exhausted. >_<
	Babamots: Oh, you're right. I thought the b1 had come from somewhere else. Sorry about that.
