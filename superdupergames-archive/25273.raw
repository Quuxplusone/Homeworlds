Homeworlds Online (SDG# 25273)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2014.1.31, Ended: 2014.2.6
Participants: ausmuh (S), fogus (N)
Winner: fogus

1) fogus: Homeworld R1 B2 G3
	ausmuh: Hello.  I'm certainly not the worlds greatest player,  but I know and love the game.   I'm sure we can get you started.  Please feel free to ask any questions you have.
	fogus: Thanks a ton.  My first game was catastrophe-o-rama and my second was a resource-strangulation.  So far I've covered a broad swath of the ways to lose.  :-)

2) ausmuh: Homeworld B3 Y1 G3
	ausmuh: Haha, it happens. After family few games you start to know what to look for and avoid.  Looks like you know about your homeworld options, woo!

3) fogus: Build G1 Fogus
	ausmuh: *After a few.  Autocorrect..... 
	ausmuh: The next move is pretty much always the same, then it gets fun.  When you start trading pieces you want to avoid getting locked out,  and if possible,  lock me out. 

4) ausmuh: Build G1 Ausmuh

5) fogus: Trade G1 Y1 Fogus

6) ausmuh: Trade G1 Y1 Ausmuh
	ausmuh: The colors I'd consider swapping to would be yellow or red. Because if I want to swap to one of those, you would get the first two pip out of it.  It can also sometimes be difficult to get into a color once the 1pips are gone.
 
From here on out it's my opinion,  take it with a grain of salt :) everyone sees things different and you may know something I don't.
	ausmuh: Yup,  just like that. 

7) fogus: Build G1 Fogus

8) ausmuh: Build Y2 Ausmuh

9) fogus: Build Y2 Fogus
	ausmuh: It's usually not a bad idea to get a 2pip when you can. You do need to watch out for me being able to catastrophe you, but right now it's safe.  Also keep an eye out for a way to put me under the same threat.

10) ausmuh: Discover Y1 Ausmuh G2 Gwar
	fogus: The threat of catastrophe is not a problem now because you're not within striking distance?

	fogus: There are two things about HWs that I'm not entirely clear about: 1) How systems connect and 2) How attacking works.  
	ausmuh: Ah,  ok.  Systems connect as long as they are NOT the same size.  So from a 1pip planet you can move to a 2pip or 3pip.  Homeworlds have 2 parts,  so because of that you can only move to the size you didn't use in your home planet. 
 
For you the path is home-3pip,  3pip-2pip, then the 2pip is connected to me
	ausmuh: So the reason you are safe is I have to move my 1 pip yellow out of my home first,  after that,  I -could- sacrifice my 2pip yellow for two moves and make it to your base. 
	ausmuh: Hopefully that makes sense.
 
Attacking is more like capturing in this game.  Ships must be at the same planet. A ship can attack the same size or smaller,  but instead of blowing it up,  you take control of it. 

11) fogus: Trade Y1 R1 Fogus

12) ausmuh: Discover Y1 Gwar G3 Grass
	ausmuh: So now that I moved out, I have a new mini-base,  one step closer to you.
 
The mid game is somewhat about spreading pieces out so you can get bigger and more. 
	ausmuh: Lets try an attack! Move your red ship and lay waste to my tiny yellow minion

13) fogus: Move R1 Fogus Grass

14) ausmuh: Build G1 Ausmuh
	fogus: Would it have been better to sacrifice to make the move and attack in one turn?

15) fogus: Attack Y1 Grass
	ausmuh: Sadly a sacrifice can
	ausmuh: Sadly a sacrifice cant do that.  You only get the actions of what color you sacrificed.  So sacrificing a 2pip yellow gets you 2 moves.  That becomes important later on. 

16) ausmuh: Build Y1 Ausmuh
	fogus: Oh!  If I sacrifice a yellow2 then I can only move twice?
	ausmuh: Correct, when ever you sacrifice a piece you only get actions of that color's power
	ausmuh: So at this point, were pretty much just spreading out and racing to build bigger pieces used in future plans.... something to think about is sacrificing a g3 and building other 3pips with those actions (while avoiding catastrophe)

17) fogus: Sacrifice Y2 Fogus
Discover Y1 Grass Y2 Cats
Move Y1 Cats Ausmuh
Catastrophe Ausmuh Y
	ausmuh: I wouldn't normally do that, but it gives you an example of sacrificing for a catastrophe.  Your y2 can move your y1 in and destroy part of my hw

18) ausmuh: Trade G1 Y1 Ausmuh
	fogus: Oh!  I see how that works now.  I had to discover a system before moving into yours for the catastrophe.  Was there a better way?
	fogus: A point I always miss (for whatever reason) is that the star colors count toward catastrophe also.
	ausmuh: Nope, the discovery was needed. If i had a system you could of used that one, but either works
 
Ah,  yes,  that's worth noting, planets count :) Also pay attention to our homeworlds being connected now.  
 
"The doomsday machine" involves two y3's, enough pieces to destroy me, and takes advantage of the new connections.
 
Its a double edge sword though because I'm connected to you just the same
	ausmuh: So one way to win is blowing me up.  That probably the most common tactic. 

19) fogus: Trade G1 Y1 Fogus
	ausmuh: Next I want to show what a homeworld attack looks like.  Its a little tougher to set up,  easier to notice, but well worth knowing.  
 
What you need is at least one more 3pip than I have in my homeworld (2 in this case) and a big enough red piece to sacrifice to take what I have. And enough yellow to move them in.
 
Normally an opponent will build red when you do,  and sometimes its hard to build enough 3 pips to overpower your opponent,  especially if you have to leave one at home

20) ausmuh: Build G1 Ausmuh

21) fogus: Build G1 Fogus
	fogus: Is there ever a reason not to put a 3-pip at your homeworld?
	ausmuh: Sometimes... like now.   You have red and I do not.  Our home worlds are connected. If you move your big guy in,  you'll take my 3pip before I get the red to react.
 
Be very careful with that,  if an opponent is ready to move big ships in on you,  you want to keep a 3pip at home

22) ausmuh: Discover G1 Ausmuh B2 Gwar

23) fogus: Trade G1 R1 Fogus

24) ausmuh: Build G1 Gwar

25) fogus: Build R2 Fogus

26) ausmuh: Build Y1 Ausmuh

27) fogus: Build Y2 Fogus

28) ausmuh: Build G1 Ausmuh

29) fogus: Build G2 Fogus
	ausmuh: Just don't forget planets count towards catastrophes :)

30) ausmuh: Move Y1 Ausmuh Gwar
	fogus: I almost forgot :-O (whew)

31) fogus: Sacrifice Y2 Fogus
Move G3 Fogus Ausmuh
Move R1 Fogus Ausmuh
	fogus: It seems like blue ships are kinda the weakest.  If there is a blue star then what use is a blue ship?
	ausmuh: This game didn't see much blue but it can come in handy.   One example is sacrificing to trade multiple ships for a catastrophe,  and sometimes you can trade a blue ship for another color before anyone has access to it.  I. E. Trade a b3 for a r3 when its good timing.   You'll feel it out the more you play :)
	ausmuh: I've purposely been neglecting red to show you what moving in for a homeworld attack looks like (sort of) 
 
Sense our homeworlds are connected and I've got no red,  you have a perfect opportunity to move your big ship in and sweep up in my homeworld.  Normally an opponent would somehow scramble for their own red,  but is just some practice to show you a few things. 

32) ausmuh: Build Y2 Gwar
	fogus: I can't seem to do what I'm thinking:
sacrifice r2 fogus
move g3 fogus ausmuh
attack G3S ausmuh
	fogus: Oh wait... all actions must be that of the color sacrificed. 
	ausmuh: Close.  Because,  and only because,  I have no red,  you can move in as one turn,  then attack on the next turn :)

33) fogus: Attack G3 Ausmuh

34) ausmuh: Build G2 Ausmuh
Catastrophe Ausmuh Green
	ausmuh: Many of my moves were less then smart,  but hopefully it gave you a chance to figure a couple things out :)

35) fogus: Attack Y1 Ausmuh

	ausmuh: There really is not,  even after a catastrophe,  you are more than prepared to overtake my homeworld 
	fogus: I definitely missed that catastrophe option.  It's a good thing I decided to bring in the r1... even if that wasn't my initial goal. ;-)
 
Thank you very much for the lesson.  I learned a ton.
	ausmuh: :) thanks for your patience, I'm not much of a teacher,  but I'm glad you learned some stuff.  Have fun!
