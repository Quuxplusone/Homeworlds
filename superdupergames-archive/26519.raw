Homeworlds Online (SDG# 26519)
Variants: "Hard time"
Started: 2014.11.18, Ended: 2014.11.19
Participants: wil (S), TeeTeeTee (N)
Winner: TeeTeeTee

1) TeeTeeTee: Homeworld Y1 B2 G3

2) wil: Homeworld B3 Y2 G3
	TeeTeeTee: Another re-challenge! Have a good game.
 
(Perhaps I should play some more non-ladder games, as I only ever make a conservative choice of homeworlds in these ladder games.)

3) TeeTeeTee: Build G1 Teeteetee

4) wil: Build G1 Wil
	wil: Yeah, I just signed up on the ladders of volcano an martian chess and put up challenges so I can learn those...

5) TeeTeeTee: Trade G1 Y1 Teeteetee

6) wil: Trade G1 Y1 Wil
	TeeTeeTee: Maybe I should give those two a go at some point... Homeworlds and Zendo were the only two pyramids games that have really leapt out at me so far. (I think Zendo works better in a pub than online, though: the SDG interface for Zendo is arcane and ineffective, and the game that I was running has completely fizzled out, now.)
	wil: Zendo was my first introduction to them...my daughter bought it at a game designer gathering, she met Kory, played the game with others there and wanted to get it..

7) TeeTeeTee: Build Y2 Teeteetee

8) wil: Build Y2 Wil
	wil: I still am working on the strategies involved in Martian Chess and Volcano...have yet to win a game (but I am might just have one soon)

9) TeeTeeTee: Discover Y1 Teeteetee G3 Leviathan
	wil: hmmm  am I still gonna make the same mistake?  I should have had a y3 homeworld?

10) wil: Discover Y1 Wil G1 G1

11) TeeTeeTee: Build Y3 Leviathan
	wil: i think that worx

12) wil: Build Y3 G1

13) TeeTeeTee: Move Y3 Leviathan G1
	TeeTeeTee: This game is very different from the last few: you've not been frozen out of yellow, or any other colour. By choosing to not have a y3 in your homeworld, you immediately made yellows the most advantageous ships to go for: if I'd done anything else but go for a large yellow and let you do the same, then I think I'd have been at a great disadvantage. 
 
I'll have to stop and think about my next move for a bit, here. Up till now, my moves have been mostly automatic, as the opening was more-or-less decided by your choice of homeworld.
	TeeTeeTee: Let's try this.

14) wil: Move Y3 G1 Leviathan
	wil: oh my
	wil: incredible move... so many ways to make a big costly mistake on my part!  let us hope this isn't one of them.

15) TeeTeeTee: Build Y3 Leviathan

16) wil: Move Y3 Leviathan Teeteetee

17) TeeTeeTee: Trade Y2 R2 Teeteetee
	wil: I just don't know...

18) wil: Discover Y3 Teeteetee R3 R3
	TeeTeeTee: I wouldn't have done that. I don't believe you can both keep that y3 and stop me invading your homeworld on my next turn, now.
	wil: amazing defeat yet agin...

19) TeeTeeTee: Move Y3 G1 Wil

20) wil: Move Y1 G1 Wil
Catastrophe Wil Y
	TeeTeeTee: I think this is my game again, yes. You can blow up your homeworld and my large yellow, but I'll invade in a turn or two anyway as our homeworlds will be directly connected.

21) TeeTeeTee: Build R1 Teeteetee
	wil: I think I lose before I challenge with you!

22) wil: Build G1 Wil

23) TeeTeeTee: Move G3 Teeteetee Wil

24) wil: Sacrifice G3 Wil
Build G1 Wil
Build G1 Wil
Build Y1 R3
Catastrophe Wil G
	TeeTeeTee: I think this game went badly for you because you sort of gave up as soon as I moved my y3 to g1. I was definitely ahead at that point, but the game wasn't over! Once you made the unfortunate move of invading with the y3, that was when the game was practically decided.
	wil: I didn't see any move at that time...the move I made I missed you getting the red...
