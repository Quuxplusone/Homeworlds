	Trydnt: asimov is pretty safe as you have a red ship there so if I move in the r3 you could always grow more red and blow it up
	Trydnt: Lem and Zelasny are both vulnerable but you could blow up Lem by sacrificing a g2 and growing two blues. I'd probably have sacrificed your y2 piece and moved some things. maybe leave it so a b3 (or more) was available to grow on your next turn. I can't grow blue easily as I only have blue at my homeworld and I'm therefore limited by the star color
	Trydnt: But yeah you're situation was pretty dire after I blew up all that red and took your large. Always be wary of moving a large ship somewhere where your opponent has a piece of the same color as it's not hard to grow a bit and blow up your large, especially if they have a g2 lying about
