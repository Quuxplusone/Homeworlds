Winner: TwoShort

1) TwoShort: Homeworld R1 B3 G3
jonaskoelker: Hi, TwoShort. This'll be my 6th game of Homeworlds, with two of my previous games still in progress, so I'm kinda' new. Feel free to give tips "too late" as I've seen you do before.

jonaskoelker: I think I got the basics down: start with a green ship; have more large pieces than your opponent; don't get locked out of any color; always have a large ship in your homeworld.

jonaskoelker: I also think it tends to be a good idea to have a diverse fleet, color-wise, that's spread out (so it's easier to make good use of a G3 sacrifice); and that it's good to have your pieces close to your opponent's homeworld (and your opponents pieces in general) so it's easier to threaten invasion or catastrophe.

jonaskoelker: In any case, I'd love to have a strategy-and-tactics discussion during and/or after the game. You up for it?

jonaskoelker: In any case, good luck and have fun :)

2) jonaskoelker: Homeworld B1 R2 G3
TwoShort: I'm generally up for strategy discussions. I should note that when I give people "late" tips, it's not generally because I want to make sure I win. Mostly it's just that it's not clear what tips to give until they're too late.

3) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

4) jonaskoelker: Build G1 Jonaskoelker
jonaskoelker: Well, let me kick off some strategy discussion already, then:

jonaskoelker: I've been looking a bit at http://superdupergames.org/?page=archive_play&gid=2121&idx=26

jonaskoelker: In the final move, you invade Andy's homeworld, threatening either conquest (by sacrificing R2 @home) or yellow catastrophe by building yellow @Andy.

jonaskoelker: Instead of building G3 (@B3), how do you think Andy should have continued?

jonaskoelker: I see three main lines; either trade Y3 to R3 @home; or sacrifice G2 to build R1 and R2 @B1; or trade Y2 to R2 @B1.

jonaskoelker: As far as I can tell, "trade Y3 R3 @home" is answered by "build G3 @B1", forcing Andy to sacrifice G2 to build R1 and R2 @(a mix of B1 and home). Then you have a 3-to-1 lead in large ships with a large "forward deployment" giving you a lot of initiative and putting Andy under pressure; maybe continue by building red @home and moving one forward (to a large star), threatening red catastrophe if Andy isn't careful. Or chase down the G1@B3 and try to monopolize the green pieces? Or maybe just hang back and grab all the large pieces and build 'em up slowly, banker-style.

jonaskoelker: If Andy continues with "sacrifice G2, build R1 and R2 @B1" instead, things get more interesting. One good next move might be "build R2 @home", threatening "sacrifice Y3 @home, move R2 home b1 (with red catastrophe), move Y3 b1 Andy", with conquest the next turn. Moving a red piece from B1 to Andy seems to counter this threat, and I'm not sure how to best proceed. What do you think?

jonaskoelker: I'm not sure how to best proceed if Andy trades his Y2 for R2 @B1. How would you proceed?

jonaskoelker: Also, do you think you had the lead when Andy screwed up? What was the most decisive move in the game besides Andy's blunder? What helped tip the scales?

5) TwoShort: Trade G1 Y1 Twoshort

6) jonaskoelker: Trade G1 Y1 Jonaskoelker
TwoShort: Well, really I think Andy was doomed, and the previous move, when I advanced the g2, was the game winner. Before that, he had moved his Gs apart, threatening to grow and getting the better end of the g3s. He missed the immediate threat my move represented, but at the time I expected he would see it and be forced to deal with it, and none of his options there are any good. Since he can't build a G3 or immediately threaten me, I get to build a G3 the next turn, and wind up with at least one of the two remaining ones. Depending how that all works out, I get 4 or 5 3 points to his 1 or 2, and that's game over, pretty much whatever the details.


7) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

8) jonaskoelker: Build G1 Jonaskoelker
jonaskoelker: "the previous move, when I advanced the g2, was the game winner."

jonaskoelker: Instead of moving the G2 forward, I think you can sacrifice the Y3 at home, move your Y1 and Y3 from B1 into Andy's homeworld, and move the G2 to the Y1 (where Andy has a G2). Your R2 at home threatens to take Andy's ships, so he has to get rid of your invaders; the only way I can see of doing that is to sacrifice a Y2 (or his Y3) and move his remaining yellow(s) and some other piece back home. Then you build G3 at Y1, and Andy can't defend against the impending invasion.

jonaskoelker: Your thoughts?

jonaskoelker: [but if instead you move G2 to B1 as you did] "I get to build a G3 the next turn" -- not if Andy sacrifices his G2 to build R1 and R2 at B1; it's not clear to me how to get an overwhelming material advantage (say a 3-pointer lead of at least two). What are your thoughts?


9) TwoShort: Trade G1 B1 Twoshort
TwoShort: My main thought is that you've analyzed this more deeply than I did at the time or have since :)

TwoShort: Let's see - if he sacs to build the 2 reds, I build a 2 (@B1), he builds a 3 (@B3), I build a 3 (@Y2). He can then catastrophe my G3 (and
TwoShort: G1) at the cost of his G3, G1, and Y2; or separate his gs to go after the last 3 at the cost of a y2, which I can block by moving something to g3. So best case (for him) I still have the single 3 advantage I started with, and I gain ground in the little stuff.

TwoShort: Honestly, I seldom bother to think more than a move or two in advance. I figure out what happens if everyone does the most straightforward growing thing (like above), and hope I'll find as many clever twists as the other guy.

TwoShort: Homeworlds positions in a developed game offer so many options, it's a struggle to not miss a good one considering a single position, once you get a few moves into speculation, the chance you're considering a position you'll actually reach vs. a real opponent is tiny... I look for ways to grab material; ways to force my opponent to do something other than grab material, and that's about it. Tactical, positional advantages are obviously what determines who gets to grab stuff, and are where all the action is. But if you can't turn them into a material advantage in a pretty short term, straightforward way, they may be illusory.

TwoShort: The other question is what constitutes an overwhelming material advantage. By my count, I had a pretty good lead before the g2 move, and was really only looking to prevent him using his tactical position to change that.

10) jonaskoelker: Trade G1 B1 Jonaskoelker
jonaskoelker: "My main thought is that you've analyzed this more deeply than I did at the time or have since :)"

jonaskoelker: Probably true :) I think it's an interesting game with a lot of sharp variations near the (premature?) end, which illustrate the tactics of homeworlds very well.

jonaskoelker: By the way, as I look at the line of play I suggest instead of "14. move g2; ...", I don't think building G3 at Y1 in the end is good enough; then Andy can build G at Y1 and trigger a green catastrophe. But I better look at a board before I make any definitive claims about that.

jonaskoelker: [Just got home from vacation. I'll move soon]

jonaskoelker: Ah crap, I looked at the wrong position on SDG. Instead of "14. move g2", do the sac Y3 as suggested earlier. Then Andy has to move all his yellows home, and either R1 or G2. If he moves R1 home, invade with G2 and win; if he moves G2 home, build a G3 (which is safe from catastrophe, but wasn't in the position I looked at), invade and win.


11) TwoShort: Build B2 Twoshort
jonaskoelker: I'm not really sure this is the right move. It lets you get the B2s first; but alternatively I might get locked out of blue, which is no good either. Probably letting you get the first B2 is no problem, since you can't get the last too, unless you let me get the first B3.

jonaskoelker: Oh well, we'll see...
jonaskoelker: Going back to your game vs. Andy (please let me know if you get bored of it), I've come to the conclusion that "13. ..., discover g1 different b3 BigBlueFrog" is the definitively losing move. But even in that position, I'd rather bet on you winning than him.

jonaskoelker: But how did you get to have the advantageous position? I may be going out on a limb here, but I think it might be on the strength of the banker opening; that, combined with your plays, got you the second Y3 which makes your position preferable.

jonaskoelker: Your thoughts?

12) jonaskoelker: Discover B1 Jonaskoelker G3 Biggreen

13) TwoShort: Discover B2 Twoshort G2 Grogar

14) jonaskoelker: Build B2 Biggreen

15) TwoShort: Build B2 Grogar
jonaskoelker: Do you think I made the right move here?

jonaskoelker: I'm worried about you setting up a "green/blue factory", alternating between [sac g3, build b2/b3/b3] and [sac b2, trade b3/g3 and b3/*], netting you a big ship every other turn.

jonaskoelker: Meanwhile, I of course want one of those. But I'm starting to suspect that sending out my blue was a bad move. Instead I should have built a b2, then ventured out. Maybe.

jonaskoelker: What do you think?

TwoShort: build b2 grogar

16) jonaskoelker: Trade B2 Y2 Biggreen
TwoShort: I'm not sure if building first would be better. I'd have done something different if you did - flip my initial b2 to red or yellow, then grow it again.
TwoShort: As long as you have blue somewhere that can grow, I can't do flip green and sac to get it back thing - you can take it in the middle. The threat I'm pursuing here is that I can sac my g3 to build both b3s, getting a 3 pointer lead. The hope is really that you'll have to do unproductive things to prevent this, while I can do productive things that also keep the threat going. Or you can build a 3 now, I'll blow it up, and I'll be ahead by a 2 point beyond my homeworld... Which is reasonably good from my perspective; from yours it's a question of whether you can do better, which is not clear to me...
TwoShort: I used to think you should never take a b1 star as first player, but someone recently wiggled out of my response to that. My new theory is that you should never take a b1 star playing Banker; but I haven't played enough against people doing so as second player to be sure.
jonaskoelker: hmm... you probably have a good point wrt. regrowing your blue. And wrt. me stopping your blue/green factory.
jonaskoelker: Hmm... let's see if there's something I can do about your evul schemes ;-)
TwoShort: So the other reason I avoid giving timely advice is that opponents seem to think I have things all figured out, which isn't true... Just hope you're not stressing too much and thinking I have you entirely boxed in; I'm happy with my position, but you've certainly got options that I can't calculate the results of...
jonaskoelker: I think I'm stressing out just enough ;-)
jonaskoelker: I'd be happy with your position too, it seems better right now. But I still got a fighting chance, it's not just a matter of losing more slowly.

17) TwoShort: Trade B2 R2 Grogar
jonaskoelker: I hope this was one of the options you couldn't quite figure out ;-)
TwoShort: Well, when I said you had good options, I really meant just that one :) On the other hand, I thought I had only a single obvious response, but it wasn't this...

18) jonaskoelker: Trade Y1 R1 Jonaskoelker

19) TwoShort: Build B2 Grogar
jonaskoelker: That was not funny. Not funny at all :(
jonaskoelker: I think my move was bad but the alternatives I could come up with were worse.
jonaskoelker: If I built b2 at biggreen, you'd move your b2 from Grogar to biggreen (sac y1 home), threatening to take my last blue ship. I can build and trigger catastrophe, but then you build b1 at home and I'm left... erm... "blueless" ;-)
jonaskoelker: What do you think?
TwoShort: I don't think your being blueless would have been a problem since there would have been plenty in the stash... which is why I would have moved in the r2 instead, expecting you to sac the y2 to run away with the other two. Which would have been not great for you. Better or worse than this, I'm not sure...
