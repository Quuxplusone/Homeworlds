Winner: TeeTeeTee

1) TeeTeeTee: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3

2) wil: Homeworld B3 Y1 G3

3) TeeTeeTee: Build G1 Teeteetee

4) wil: Build G1 Wil

5) TeeTeeTee: Trade G1 Y1 Teeteetee
	wil: we been saying the rules should be a binary homeworld and then a large and a small of the same color to start....


6) wil: Trade G1 Y1 Wil
	TeeTeeTee: Might as well. I guess it's possible to start a game without a green star or ship, and trade for one on the first turn, but there isn't really any benefit from that at all.

7) TeeTeeTee: Build Y2 Teeteetee

8) wil: Build Y2 Wil

9) TeeTeeTee: Discover Y1 Teeteetee G3 Hammerfall
	wil: The only issue I see is if someone makes an extreme counter play to your opening...so extreme that you wish to change your ship prior to building your first small ship...  but yeah the typical opening requires G n B, Y n R are the options....and both have their reasoning...

10) wil: D Y1 Wil G2 G2

11) TeeTeeTee: Build Y3 Hammerfall

12) wil: Build Y3 G2
	TeeTeeTee: Just so you know, I'm going on holiday for the rest of the week - I'll be back before I time out, though.
	wil: poifect....I won't be badmouthin you then...hee hee tee tee

13) TeeTeeTee: Discover Y3 Hammerfall B2 Avantasia

14) wil: Discover Y1 G2 Y3 Y3

15) TeeTeeTee: Trade Y2 G2 Teeteetee

16) wil: Trade Y2 R2 Wil

17) TeeTeeTee: Sacrifice G2 Teeteetee
Build Y2 Hammerfall
Build Y2 Avantasia

18) wil: Build G1 Wil
	TeeTeeTee: Sorry! I know that an undo after a few minutes is a little cheeky, but, erm, I'd rather be slightly rude than lose the top ladder position on a blunder like that.

19) TeeTeeTee: Trade Y3 R3 Avantasia
	TeeTeeTee: ... on second thought, you don't have a winning move on this turn, after all. Sorry to mess you around :p
	TeeTeeTee: (I think)
	wil: whoa now...two things...first and formost I need a good blunder on your part to win...and second...in the physical game we have a move token...this thing misses setting the stage to review prior to deciding it is your final answer....so one undo is nothing...it should be unlimited..

20) wil: Build Y3 G2
	TeeTeeTee: Righto. In my mind, when I submit a turn, that's the online equivalent of passing the move token across, so I should have just let it go. 
 
I realised after submitting my last move that you could have sacrificed your y3 to move your g3 to my homeworld. From that position, there would have been nothing I could do to stop you from conquering my homeworld by sacrificing the r2 - but you'd have had no ships at your world, either. Guess you're after a win, and not a draw, then?

21) TeeTeeTee: Sacrifice Y2 Avantasia
Move Y1 Hammerfall G2
Move Y2 Hammerfall G2
Catastrophe G2 Yellow
	wil: a I am never after a draw...  and I can't abandon a home world to win or draw...that is a loss before the draw or win happens...  but b...   tis  a flaw in the system, the game is complex enough that you need to see it played out...and then decide if it is what you want to do.... with the configuration here...the undo is required..imo

22) wil: Trade G1 Y1 Wil

23) TeeTeeTee: Build G1 Teeteetee

24) wil: Build Y2 Wil
	wil: I dint think you'd pull that trigger!

25) TeeTeeTee: Trade G1 R1 Teeteetee

26) wil: Discover Y2 Wil G2 G2

27) TeeTeeTee: Trade R3 Y3 Avantasia
	TeeTeeTee: Yeah, I kind of had to, as I didn't want to be a large ship down. There's the blunder you were waiting on - I didn't expect you to build a y3 there because I could go a large ship up if you did. I'm now a large ship up, but definitely in a weaker position than you. Let's see if I can come back from this!
 
By the way, did you get my email, and find the time to have a look at it?

28) wil: Sacrifice G3 Wil
Build Y2 Y3
Build Y3 Wil
Build R1 Wil
	wil: hmmm email must've got in wrong box...will check...  and I need you to make bigger blunders.... but look G2 is back and building yellows is a thing again!!

29) TeeTeeTee: Move Y3 Avantasia Wil
Catastrophe Wil Yellow

30) wil: Build Y1 G2

31) TeeTeeTee: Build R1 Teeteetee

32) wil: Trade R2 G2 Wil
	wil: yeah, some how I was blinded to see that comin...face palm...  I'm so outta my league.

40) wil: Move R1 Wil Teeteetee

41) TeeTeeTee: Attack R1 Teeteetee
	wil: I must admit... I have no clue what is going on.

42) wil: Build R2 Wil
	wil: oh...I see

43) TeeTeeTee: Trade R2 G2 Teeteetee
	wil: I saw before the move...but don't yet really know who has the step ahead...probably you.

44) wil: Move R2 Wil Teeteetee

45) TeeTeeTee: Sacrifice R1 Teeteetee
Attack R2 Teeteetee
	TeeTeeTee: Until that last move, you were definitely ahead.
	TeeTeeTee: ... perhaps you still are.

46) wil: Move Y1 Y3 G2
	wil: hmmm...  I thought you had me by one step...

	wil: and still think you have me...

47) TeeTeeTee: Move B3 Teeteetee Wil

	wil: Well that was a strange one, nice game...thanx... 
	TeeTeeTee: Thanks for the game. Perhaps I was being too negative about my position, but I did feel like I was in trouble for most of that game. I reckon that "10. Trade y3 r3 Avantasia" was a major error on my part: as I said, I assumed you wouldn't build a large ship as I could destroy them both - but building that ship anyway meant I had the choice of being a large ship down or losing all my yellow ships.
 
Even after you made the mistake of letting me blow up your large ship and half your homeworld, I still didn't feel like I was winning: you had a total monopoly on yellows, far more ships than I did, and I couldn't just move my large ship to your homeworld without losing, then. If, at that point, I'd played carefully and just tried to acquire more ships, then you would have soon built large ships, I would still have had no yellow ships, and my last chance to attack would be gone. 
 
My only real chance of winning was to get an attack together before you acquired a large ship - and I was fortunate that it worked. I get the feeling that you could have acquired a large ship at some point somehow, though. Perhaps, on your last move, instead of moving that y1 to g2, you could have sacrificed the y1 at the star y3, and moved the y2 there to TeeTeeTee? On the next go, you could have sacrificed the g2 to build a y3 at wil (and a y1 at g2).
 
Still, I think you underestimate yourself at this game - and I think I underestimated you too! You played much better than me for the first half of the game. By the way, do you want me to resend you the email I wrote via PM?
	wil: The game is a blast.  Your circumventing my control of the yellows was awesome...we were neck and neck, I thought I had it for a minute, until you got my homeworld, and then I thought I had a chance with my red game to get to that big ship...you cut me off masterfully.   Yes please send the email via pm...I can't find it.
thx again for the lesson
