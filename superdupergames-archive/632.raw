	jesse: You must be new. It is vital to have green in your home system at the start of the game. You can't use red until our forces come into contact.  You can't use yellw until you have another ship to leave in your home system.  You can use blue to change the color of your ship, but in that case you should have started with the new color to begin with.  I'll give you a chance to change to green now.
	jesse: It is also very important to start with a large ship, rather than a medium. Large ships are power. Without one, you will be weak on both offense and defense.
