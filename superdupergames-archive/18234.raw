18) SilentTitan: Build Y2 Areosmith

19) Remneb: Trade B1 R1 Remneb
	Remneb: How can your Areosmith system (g3)be connected to your Homeworld (r3,b2)? Same stars of 3 pips?You should have a one pip star to be connected yes or no?

20) SilentTitan: Trade Y1 B1 Silenttitan
	SilentTitan: connected isn't really the issue... it's not like a supply line.   I used a 1-pip to get to the three pip ... but once I left the 1-pip system I went back to the bank. See down at 18:22:02 where it says the killers system has been abandoned to the hyperspatial flux?  if I wanted to move back to my homeworld with something in areosmith (which would take two moves) I would have to discover another 1-pip world and from there I could move to my homeworld
	SilentTitan: I = it went back to the bank (meaning the 1-pip world named killers

21) Remneb: Build B2 Remneb
	Remneb: So a new system discovered by a ship coming from another system then the Homeworld do not have to be connected to the Homeworld ?

22) SilentTitan: Discover B1 Silenttitan Y1 Checkcheck
	SilentTitan: correct it only has to be connected to the previous system.  The one it came from. If you came from a 1p you can only go to a 2p or 3p in one move. if you came from a homeworld then you can only go the size missing in the homeworld. In this game I can only go out to 1p and you can only go out to 3p stars from our homeworlds. From each of those system you can go to any legit system.  Note however I can only gain access to your homeworld from a 3p star and you can only get to mine from a 1p star. Keep in mind if I were to burn the 2p star in my own homeworld our homeworlds would be connected directly together.

33) Remneb: Build Y3 Remneb

34) SilentTitan: Build Y3 Silenttitan
	SilentTitan: ok... you've done great up till this last move. I beleive that you'd be better off discovering a new system with that y1 rather than pilling up two yellows in Edinga.
	Remneb: I'm doing that cause i have an eye on the 3 yellow in the reserve ( 2 of 3 pips and 1 of 2 pips).In think sacrifying my g3 to have these 3 yellow can give me more power...well maybe it's not a so good idea.
	Remneb: I need a yellow ship in each system if i don't want too many of that color in the same system.
