TwoShort: Well, I guess I won't undo, but I just realized I should have sac'd a y3 to put the other y3 in your homeworld...
zoltar: Wow -- I didn't even see that. I did remember the principle that I should immediately get a red when you do, but I looked and didn't see any threats. But if you have a red piece and I don't, then sticking a 3-size anything in my homeworld is a major threat, isn't it?! Still learning basic principles here.

22) zoltar: Build G2 Zoltar
TwoShort: Yeah, I didn't see it at first, because it would have meant leaving my homeworld without a 3, which is typically bad, so my brain discards such moves without much consideration. But in this cae I could have won before you could do anything to me.
