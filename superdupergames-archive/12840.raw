	TwoShort: Since you're new, a couple words of strategy advice: First, I'd generally recommend starting with a green ship, it's easiest and usually best.  Second, you don't usually want to build up to three of the same color in one system.  I could move my y1 from Bluonia into bob right now and cause a catastophe.  I won't this turn because I'd rather take the y3 while I can get it.  Also note that you can't take the other y3 at your homeworld because I'll sacrifice my y2 to move the y1 twice, and win with a catastrophe in your home.
