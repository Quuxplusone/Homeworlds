13) mneme: Build Y2 Mneme
	stoneaxe: Was that a fatal error?  I know I need to build some yellow, but i seemed to be playing right into your 'sac G3 and build all the rest of yellow trap', so I went with this move instead.

27) mneme: Discover Y1 Apple G3 Heart
	stoneaxe: I need to get the G3 back to have any glimmer of hope.  This might give you 2 3's, but at least I get one 3.  Or, if you sac and go for all the yellows, then I get some choices... I think.  
	mneme: on the contrary, my best dodge is to keep you out of 3s.

32) stoneaxe: Build B1 Stoneaxe
	mneme: that was pretty much the case when you got both of your larges blown, but yeah, now I get to monopolize y -and- churn out larges -and- be the only one who can move ships around or make catastrophes.  Not so good for you.
