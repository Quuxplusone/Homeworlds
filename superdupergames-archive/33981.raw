Wow it has been a while. You will crush me in no time I'm afraid. Regardless, I'm super excited to play a game with you again!
 
I do not exactly remember how/why I quit so abruptly. Looking back it was a bit rude. I know I was a bit too absorbed by the game to the point it was mildly unhealthy. And most probably I was writing my thesis and I had to cut all good excuses to procrastinate... 
 
Anyhow, I saw this little "SDG" folder in my inbox and I thought I would try to reconnect. Seeing your name brought back good memories (I almost left out a tear of joy); and here we are!
 
I hope all is well for you. How did the tournament of last August pan out?
 
 
 
All of your vegetables are belong to us!!
Let the fun begin.
	wil: Well now!!  Yes it has been a while!!  And I'll bet you'll be able to jump right back on this horse. Wonderful to hear from you, I've  been thinking about you a lot.  We are currently in a tournament and I've been telling folks without you, TTT and twoshort...this really isn't a tournament!!   

	wil: It was your thesis...PhD in hand now?  How is everything going?  I have a kid I taught..he will be headed back to London soon, with his PolSci masters he acquired here stateside.  He will be a formidable player...hope to see you both in the next tourney (takes forever on SDG)  Wish we had another platform (wink wink nod nod)

3) Broccoli_Commander: Build G1 Broccoli_commander

4) wil: Build G1 Wil
	Broccoli_Commander: Yes, now been working for 4 years in the "industry", but I still can't say I found my definitive career path yet. But life is good.
 
Ha! so your kid is in the same time zone... did you hook him up with SDG? Good parenting either way :-)
 
And I see you remember this idea to make an alternate app for binary homeworlds... with a chess-like clock, was that the idea?
 
Oh TeeTeeTee the new kid that deserved a lesson no one could deliver! He would probably have crushed any tournament. Too bad that TwoShort also left apparently. But I'm sure the competition is nice and fierce, happy to see some new names in there (I could check out the tournament link)!
