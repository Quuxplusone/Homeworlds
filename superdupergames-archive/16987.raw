	MagicJohn: I keep having to squirm out of situations that I created. Annoying....... Very annoying.
	rootbier: ? Don't panic man. Count moves if you have to. I doubt I have put you in any serious danger yet.
 
If you're talking about always being at the edge of overpopulation... that's part of the game yeah.

	MagicJohn: Panic,,,,no.... Grinding my teeth.... probably.....   I am just at a point where my current awareness of game variables totally exceeds my ability to juggle them.  Patience with that situation has never been my forte'.

	rootbier: Hi!

22) rootbier: Sacrifice G3 Rootbier
Build B1 Magicjohn
Build B2 Magicjohn
Build B2 Nude
	MagicJohn: My wife must be issuing invitations behind my back again. Just in time for dinner.  We're just having rootbier floats.

23) MagicJohn: Attack B3 Magicjohn
	rootbier: Blueberries!
	MagicJohn: I need a rules interpretation. I submitted the action of sacrificing my r3 and turning your blue ships in magicjohn. The game refuses my move and says that I must own a ship in my home system at the end of my turn. At the end of my turn, wouldn't I own three "blueberries" in magicjohn?   

24) rootbier: Trade B2 G2 Nude
	MagicJohn: Apparently the program likes this move, so I will trundle on. I'm still puzzled why the other move was disallowed.
	rootbier: Sacrifice moves happen in exact order. You can not sacrifice your red because it is your ONLY ship there - you would lose the moment it was gone. Furthermore - you would need a ship to attack with. If you sacrificed it you would have no ship to there to take your three by-the-rules attack actions with. Imagining that you had another smaller ship there - if you sacrificed the large red one - you would then have three attack moves using that smaller ship and would not be able to attack my larger ship.
 
Now I am just trying to figure out why I did what I did.

25) MagicJohn: Attack B2 Magicjohn

26) rootbier: Sacrifice G2 Nude

Build B3 Rootbier
Catastrophe Magicjohn B
	MagicJohn: No doubt giving me small fires to put out while you build an empire.  PS.... Thanks for the clear explanation although, in some instances, I prefer my "magic thinking" to logic.  : )
	rootbier: Taking those ships one at a time and not trading them off blue --- with green in your system -- that doesn't help you. Just wastes your turns.

27) MagicJohn: Build R1 Magicjohn
	rootbier: I am SO bad at remembering my plans from one move to the next and I almost never bother to use the notebook.

28) rootbier: Build B1 Nude
	rootbier: That feels much better :)
 
P.S. No empire plans. Maybe I just hoped to catch you sleeping. Which I didn't. And then I did.
	MagicJohn: No more dinner invitations.....
	MagicJohn: Oh!...... So if I stall long enough between moves your armies may become prone to memory-based strategic anomalies....

	rootbier: You need a plan man. Or at least you need to know some possible plans to move towards/how to be a threat.
 
What's your general thought process on all this at this point?

40) rootbier: Build G1 Rootbier
	MagicJohn: I am having trouble building or trading for blue ships.  I was considering dropping my dune ships into nude and blowing up the system.  That would make some blue ships available and limit your travel for the time being.  I was also trying to limit your travel by limiting the number of Y3's available to you although the afore-mentioned tactic would free them up.  
	rootbier: You're having trouble getting blue because I am controlling it. You can move to blues fairly easily - but yeah - it doesn't get done what I think you're looking for.
 
You're clearly going for the system. It's a great thing to consider and it's yours at the cost of that big yellow. Any slower than that it won't work so well. It could well be worth the cost if you think you'll take some of my control away. 
 
Remember that I will have the next move in that "redefined" world (three systems would disappear at once). Consider your state after - my state after - and the Stash's state after. If you have trouble visualizing - make the move and I can lay off taking my own. Give you the chance to look at it and decide if you like it. Give you time to undo.
 
You've definitely had the advantage since my failed blue invasion. Press it. Push me and limit me.

41) MagicJohn: Move R3 Magicjohn Loci
	MagicJohn: Still thinking about this. You will probably trade your red for a green and I will have to scramble to keep up. I also sacrificed material for a minor positional advantage.
	rootbier: Do you want me to wait while you consider it? Just let me know when to press on.
	MagicJohn: Still cogitating......
	rootbier: ...
	MagicJohn: ............ Wife hit rough health time. Priorities and all.  Go with the inputted move.
	rootbier: Oof... very sorry to hear that.
Something chronic or a new thing?
 
I think your move was fine.

42) rootbier: Trade G1 Y1 Rootbier
	MagicJohn: Chronic problem suddenly got a lot worse....

	MagicJohn: Wife's in hospital...  I'll play when I can but priorities and all.....

	MagicJohn: Please ignore last gibberish.  I suspect I should have moved a G3 to MagicJohn or sacrificed a Y3 and moved in an armada so you could not capture everything.....?
	rootbier: Thanks for the welcome.
 
Hope you and yours are doing better/well. It's been an odd half-year.
 
And you're right ... I can't capture a 2 with a 1.
