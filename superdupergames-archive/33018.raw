	bhorner: It seems like it's not going well, it doesn't seem like that should be possible this early!
	bhorner: Do you know openings?  Are you kind of "on book" at this point in the game?  (I don't know what the larger culture of this game is like.  :) )
	Babamots: I don't know that there's anything standard after the first for moves or so while you obviously have to build and diversify. I'm afraid it was a mistake to leave the medium and large greens so available earlier. That's what let me surge ahead. 

19) bhorner: Build G1 Bhorner
	bhorner: Yes, I see.  I thought that you wouldn't be able to go ahead because you would be forced to let me go ahead further... but I was wrong.  :)

	Babamots: Thanks for the game! The ending seemed kind of weird. I think you issued the challenge, so would you like to fill the game-finish form?
	bhorner: Weird?  I was just continually losing ground, so tried something desperate, completely exhausting my resources.  :) It might have worked if you were easily rattled.  I'll fill out the form, never done that yet.  :). Thank you for the game as well.  The beginning stung, another thing I will have to keep in mind!
