You're getting pretty far ahead of me. I'd like you to make a big mistake soon, if you don't mind.

	wil: Four moves to mate?...I should have stacked differently and been there by now...but your next move will foil that.

	wil: not the move I anticipated from you.
	dlwillson: Nice. I totally missed it. Sleeping at the wheel, here.
	wil: mistakes in this game that are capitalized on are catastrophic...am waiting for my next game in the tourney and then i have to win 4 outta my next 5 to win...we are down to 5 players and by the time I get to play again it will be down to 4 or maybe even 3.
	wil: I'd really like to see you, two short, Teeteetee and broccoli commander in the next one.
	dlwillson: The timing will have to be a lot tighter. I'd rather lose in three weeks than win in three months.
	wil: How would that happen?   Unless live on site...a game here can take three weeks.   I enjoyed the time...insuring I get to play some good games with interested variety of folk.  Just watched 'searching for bobby fisher' Even live we'd need a room full of chess clocks.
	dlwillson: I'll have to watch that movie. I desperately wish BH would take the place of Chess in the world. It's a much prettier and more interesting game. Easier to carry, too.
	wil: Chess was my favorite two player full info strategy game until....
	dlwillson: I watched Searching for Bobby Fischer. Loved it!
