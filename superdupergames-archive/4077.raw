Homeworlds Online (SDG# 4077)
Started: 2006.8.21, Ended: 2006.8.25
Participants: Keith (S), eugman (N)
Winner: Keith

1) eugman: Homeworld Y3 B1 G3

2) Keith: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3
	Keith: Hello eugman.  That was a very complex first game you played.

3) eugman: Build G1 Eugman

4) Keith: Build G1 Keith
	eugman: But a bit understandable  once you know what's going on. I noticed you have a very similar configuration to mine.

5) eugman: Trade G1 Y1 Eugman

6) Keith: Discover G1 Keith Y3 Sihnon
	Keith: Yes.  I don't care to start out with red in my home system.  That leaves one each of blue, green, and yellow.  I consider having green as one of the stars inferior because 1) if an enemy invades my home world they can grow ships using my star and 2) I can't sacrifice the star for the factory effect.

7) eugman: Build Y1 Eugman
	eugman: He was trying something different. Also if you can make it into the midgame it can provide for a strong defense.

8) Keith: Build G1 Keith

9) eugman: Trade Y1 B1 Eugman

10) Keith: Build G1 Sihnon

11) eugman: Build B2 Eugman
	eugman: Actually I'm going to wait till tomorrow to continue playing. There is no way I can play two games at once and have any chance of winning either.
	Keith: Okay.  I will just peek in on your game with Zoltar.

12) Keith: Build G2 Keith

13) eugman: Trade B2 G2 Eugman

14) Keith: Discover G1 Sihnon Y2 Whitefall
	Keith: I see Zoltar educated you on factories.

15) eugman: Trade Y1 R1 Eugman
	eugman: Educated sounds far too gentle.

16) Keith: Build G2 Whitefall
	Keith: Learning from Zoltar is like drinking from a firehose.

17) eugman: Discover B1 Eugman Y2 Someplace
	eugman: But afterwards being thristy is the least of your problems.

18) Keith: Trade G2 R2 Keith

19) eugman: Move G2 Eugman Someplace

20) Keith: Sacrifice G3 Keith
Build G2 Sihnon
Build G3 Keith
Build G3 Whitefall

21) eugman: Move G2 Someplace Eugman
	eugman: Darnit.

22) Keith: Move G1 Whitefall Eugman
	eugman: I definately don't have control of the momentum.
	Keith: I am struggling hard to try to keep you from getting it.

23) eugman: Move G2 Eugman Whitefall
	eugman: Sigh. I expected you'd try to blow me up. Natural thing to do given the opportunity and the green advantage.

24) Keith: Sacrifice R2 Keith
Attack R1 Eugman
Attack G2 Whitefall
	Keith: Actually I don't expect you would let me get a green catastrophe.  Change the G3 to something else and that ploy threatens neither ship nor planet.  I have another idea...
	eugman: But if I change it I risk letting you have factory access all by yourself.

25) eugman: Trade B1 R1 Someplace
	Keith: I am not just going for the green.  I am going for all the marbles.

26) Keith: Move G3 Whitefall Eugman
	eugman: Well you've certainly got a good collection.
	Keith: And a remote r1 has unraveled my plan.
	Keith: I was thinking I could no longer aford to move my g3 to eugman.  Maybe I still can.

	eugman: You could have won already if you took bigger risks and saw the whole picture. I'd tell you how but it's still doable.
	eugman: Hmm
	eugman: If I leave Home I lose right?
	Keith: You would lose.  No ships of your at your homeworld.  Though I think the game won't let you. 
 
Do let me know, post game, what I could have done earlier.
	eugman: You stayed all green for the most part. On turn 20 you had two large greens. You could have changed to yellow and you would have had greater mobility and still retained acess to the factory effect. It also would have made bombing me much easier since you could concievably do it in one turn and wipe out my singular large theyby securing victory.
	Keith: Thank you the advice.  I could have changed the g3 at my homeworld.  The other did not have access to blue.  I was a little leary about doing so then sacrificing my homeworld 3 pointer to attack your ship since a simple color change on your part would leave me attacking nothing and giving you something to convert.
	eugman: That's true but in theory if you forced me to change color that would be great for you since you could then sacrifice one of your twos so the 1 back at home could regrow two greens locking me out entirely.
	eugman: Whoops slight mistake in what I just said. But you would have a large green at home again.
	Keith: I see your point.  
 
I did play a game against Zoltar where I had destroyed one of his two homeworld systems and had a substantial ship advantage.  I lost the game when I rushed on offense.  So I tend to go a little slower now.
