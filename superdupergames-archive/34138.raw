	Babamots: It's an interesting opening strategy, and not one I've seen. Looks good so far.
	Draw5PlayAll: I am also doing it against MobyNostromo except that I did a small universe too.

9) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots
	Felix: I've had it used against me to great effect several times but I rarely seem to be able to pull it off properly. I just hate having green in my homeworld after the opening. It's a quick start, but not having a large green slows down my build potential in the mid game

	Babamots: Congratulations! Felix Jr. right? I guess to make it fair I should have a child during the next tournament. Sorry it's such a stressful time for you.
	Felix: Thank you! It's busy, but not stressful! More joyous than anything :)

71) Babamots: Catastrophe Felix B
Pass

	Felix: Well done!
	Babamots: Thanks. I'd like to wait until maybe Sunday to start the next tournament game. I've got this application to do tonight and then a weekend conference to prepare for. That would give you a chance to settle into the new place a bit too. That sound alright?
	Felix: Sounds fine to me. Just challenge me whenever you're ready! Looking forward to it.
	Draw5PlayAll: So wait... what happened?
	Babamots: According to Andy, you are allowed to abandon your homeworld if you eliminate your opponent by doing it (and the result is a draw). Felix would have liked to make such a move, but SDG won't allow it. For the purpose of the tournament, we're calling it a draw (even though SDG will show that I won).
	Draw5PlayAll: Ok... so you two have to rematch for the finale?
	Babamots: Yes, we just finished our additional game this morning. It's game #34209 if you'd like to study it.
