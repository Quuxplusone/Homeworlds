	Trydnt: damn I completely meant to sac the one on the other star. that was unfortunate
	Trydnt: is there any way to undo moves that end the game?
	DodoBirb: I don't think so. I suppose we could rematch if it's allowed.
	Trydnt: I sent john a message see what he says
	Babamots: Sorry about this situation. My interpretation of the rules is that you may not make a move that results in your own loss (that's what resigning is for). We should ask Aaron to fix this in SDG 2.0.
 
I think the most reasonable thing to do is follow typical chess tournament rules: you "touched" a piece that can't actually be legally moved. In chess, you just ignore that the "touch" ever took place and continue the game.
 
If you two agree that continuing is the right thing to do, here are a few possible ways to handle it.
 
1) Decide on a winner based on the current position. I'm inclined to say that Trydnt has enough of an advantage that he would have won. I'm OK with just awarding Trydnt the point, but we shouldn't do that if either of you guys don't like it. I remember being angry about a certain "Starcraft: Broodwar" tournament where the power went out and the officials called the game in favor of "Flash."
 
2) Starting a replacement game on SDG but making the same moves up to this point (and then continuing as if this hadn't happened). This might take a while, but I think it's the best option if you want to play out the rest of the moves.
 
3) Continue the game in some other way, such as a video call, traveling to an agreed meeting place to play with real pieces, or exchanging SDG-style text moves through email or here in the comments.
 
What do you guys think?
	Trydnt: I think 2) is probably the best as it is closest to what SDG should have done where it shouldn't have allowed the last move and delivered an error message which would have prompted the intended move. We wouldn't necessarily have to recreate all the same moves as we could probably amass fleets on homeworlds without calling catastrophe on either and then move everything to correct locations and sacrifice+pass any pieces that should be returned to the bank. Let me know what you think
	DodoBirb: I would probably be fine with 1 but 2 definitely seems like the best option so I'll go with that. 
	Babamots: OK, sounds like you agree that you'd like to continue the game on SDG. Go ahead and issue the challenge and put the game on the start form as usual. I'll delete this one.
