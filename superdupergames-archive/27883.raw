Participants: DOA (S), wil (N)
Winner: DOA

1) wil: Homeworld B3 Y1 G3
	wil: thanx for the game...

2) DOA: Homeworld G3 Y2 B3
	wil: Can't find a live game?

3) wil: Build G1 Wil
	DOA: Thanks and have fun.  Not many live games for me, sadly. People just don't "get" homeworlds sometimes or don't like the head to head aspect of games that I enjoy, so....  what do ya do? :)
	wil: I always liked chess...and think the complexity here is more than equivalent, I keep thinking I should find a local chess club and introduce it.

4) DOA: Build B1 Doa
	wil: Interesting opening...  so how many games have you played?  And do you like fortress and blue or are you experimenting?

5) wil: Trade G1 B1 Wil
	DOA: I've played maybe... 40 games tops, but mostly against the same opponent. Fortress is an experiment but I like blue.
 
Yeah, I feel like most chess people would like this game. The fact that homeworlds is comparatively young is a huge draw for me.  The future is wide open. I have a hard time hooking anyone with it  because of the learning curve and many choices.

	DOA: I'm out of AZ. I discovered homeworlds out of PwP, then binary from wunderland.  Got stashes, found a friend to learn with, and now here we are. 
 
Came here because of that post on Wunderland about Andy wanting opponents and offering a metal to the winners haha.  I have never made it out east for anything game related nor would I win, but a guy can have a dream. ^_^

26) DOA: Trade B2 Y2 Gee
	DOA: I have to agree about the SW. :) I have not visited the DC area sense I was in middle school. All the historical stuff, it was neat. Only played zendo a few times, but it was a lot of fun. It's awesome you're daughter had/has a zendo box. "alpha" pyramid stuff is really cool.

27) wil: Build B2 G2
	wil: I took my kids to a local game developer gathering, them showing and playtesting new games...Corey was there with Zendo, wits and wagers was being tested..my kids were each allowed to pick one game... it was a great experience...we did it a couple of years and then got caught up in life...didn't find pyramids again till a few years ago.
	wil: DC/MD/VA great spring and fall...stay away summer and winter...
