1) nycavri: Homeworld Y1 B2 G3
	nycavri: Hi, there.  I'll pass on the ZPIPs challenge in exchange for a "friendly" game.  I've had my butt handed to me in 6 straight, although I look to have my first ladder match sewn up and feel comfortable early in my other current game.  I would appreciate any words of wisdom as we proceed, thanks.  TaGG.

2) TwoShort: Homeworld R1 B3 G3

3) nycavri: Build G1 Nycavri

4) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

5) nycavri: Trade G1 Y1 Nycavri

6) TwoShort: Trade G1 Y1 Twoshort
	TwoShort: So I guess I should be coming up with some words of wisdom here...  

7) nycavri: Build Y2 Nycavri
	TwoShort: Much of the game, particularly the early game, is about jockeying for access to the bigger peices in the stash.  But I'm thinking you know that and that you took the y1 despite having access to yellow just to force me to let you have the 2 pointer.

8) TwoShort: Build Y2 Twoshort
	nycavri: That, and stalling you from getting the first g2.  Now I need to make my Homeworld a little less catastrophe-ready..... 

9) nycavri: Trade Y2 R2 Nycavri

10) TwoShort: Discover Y1 Twoshort G2 Grogar

14) TwoShort: Discover Y2 Grogar B3 Bluonia

15) nycavri: Build Y2 Deacon
	TwoShort: So I'm setting a bit of a bad example here; I'd generally recommend obtaining a sacrificeable red ship immediately when your opponent does.  But I frequently flaunt that rule when I think I can get away with it, and I think you took red a bit early;  it doesn't really help you much until you can threaten to move in with stuff it would be worth sacrificing you r2 for.

16) TwoShort: Sacrifice G3 Twoshort
Build Y3 Twoshort
Build Y3 Grogar
Build Y3 Bluonia
	nycavri: I have heard that before, and understand the wisdom, but see why you didn't need to respond yet.  How about now?
	TwoShort: Well, I was going to mention that the reason I didn't want to respond was to chase the really big prize of the early game (or even in general): 3 pointers, particularly yellow ones.  So, sorry, not yet... :)

	TwoShort: Very well played game to this point, but that last move was a mistake I'm afraid...

25) nycavri: Build G1 Nycavri

26) TwoShort: Sacrifice R2 Bluonia
Attack G3N Nycavri
Attack G1N Nycavri
	nycavri: I had to build or lose to an r2 attack, right?  Although I guess I could have moved in a Yellow.  Either way, this is all but done..... 
	nycavri: Building the r2 was clearly a game breaker, but if I recall correctly, it was over if I didn't get access to Red at home.....  Did I miss something?
	TwoShort: Well, you had the first r2 at home, the game breaker was building the second, thus allowing me to blow up your red while keeping one of my own and getting a three into your homeworld.  If you hit the "history" link at the top of the page you can step through stuff... I'm not entirely sure what you should have done instead of building the second red, maybe moved the first out to Bluonia to blow up all our red.

27) nycavri: Build Y3 Grogar

Catastrophe Nycavri Green
