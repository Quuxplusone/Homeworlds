28) wil: Move Y3 Horsehair Jrandom
	jrandom: I should probably stop thinking of my spaceships as "spaceships" -- then I wouldn't be so shy about sacrificing them...

29) jrandom: Move Y3 Horsehair B2
	wil: Nah...that is a good thought...that is why when we capture them we don't lose a ship that capable of interstellar travel and thousands of crew when we attack...however when we cause a castrophe, we are looking further at endgame...  that being said...y3s are powerful tools (as are all 3s)

	wil: nah...only catastrophe when I need to...much prefer to enslave your people and take over the ships you offer me!  Feel free to challenge as often as you want...  I'll be glad to show you various attacks and grows...
