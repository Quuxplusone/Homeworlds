	eliscinsky: I know this is NOT a GHWT19 game.  Just for fun!
	eliscinsky: eliscinsky
Babamots

	Babamots: Just for fun confirmed!
 
Any particular reason to put our names in the chat? It looks like like part of a plan of some kind.

3) eliscinsky: Build G1 Eliscinsky
	Babamots: Do you know how to deal with the instafreeze?
	eliscinsky: LOL My mistake I usually put names of systems in my notes so I can copy & paste easier.
 
As for the instafreeze ... not yet :/

4) Babamots: Build B1 Babamots

5) eliscinsky: Trade G3 B3 Eliscinsky
	Babamots: I've taken the last small blue and you're in danger of never being able to get a blue ship. With a monopoly, people can also repeatedly build a large ship, trade it away, build large, etc.
 
You may want to trade your g3 for a b3 to keep me from running away with all the blue. That's my usual defense.

6) Babamots: Trade B3 Y3 Babamots
	eliscinsky: Thanks.  I was thinking of going after yellow, but I realize that w/ so much blue I couldn't truly keep you from anything. At least not at this point in the game.

13) eliscinsky: Build G1 Eliscinsky
	Babamots: No clue if this is good for me or not, but it's pretty interesting. Notice the hyperspace bypass: our homeworlds are connected now.
	eliscinsky: OH SNAP!! Should have seen that coming. Duh!
 
Seriously I refreshed my screen and was like ... "WTF is wrong w/ this display" then I read the actions. OMG you rock! I love learning from a master!

14) Babamots: Build R1 Babamots
	eliscinsky: But w/out conversion tech I don't see how I can overtake you.  Guess we'll see.
	Babamots: You have a ship advantage, but I'm hoping that I can finish this fairly quickly. Or I may have made the mistake they warn about in the rules: "Beware the Incomplete Battle-Plan."

C Babamots G
	Babamots: Red alert :-)
 
I'm afraid it's over, but as a quick last observation, you could have built a new green ship in my home instead of moving one of your old ones. If the game weren't so close to over, it would have saved you a ship.
