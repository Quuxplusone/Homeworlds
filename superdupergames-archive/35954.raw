Homeworlds Online (SDG# 35954)
Variants: "Hard time"
Started: 2020.1.31, Ended: 2020.2.9
Participants: dlwillson (S), Babamots (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) Babamots: Homeworld B2 R1 G3

2) dlwillson: H Y1 B3 G3
	Babamots: Good luck!
 
Are you hoping to hit the top of the ladder again? I see you've been #1 a few times.
	dlwillson: TY!GL!HF! Hoping? Yes. Expecting? No. You, Simon, and Trydnt are all stronger than I am. Wil, D5PA, Felix, and I seem about equal. So, I don't suppose my #1 days are coming back, but who knows? And paying is fun, anyway.

3) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots

4) dlwillson: B G1 Dlwillson

5) Babamots: Trade G1 Y1 Babamots
	Babamots: So what I'm seeing is, we'd both like to challenge for the #1 spot when this game is over. If we hurry, we might finish this game before #1 gets tied up again.
 
Want to say winner gets dibs on challenging the top? And if so, do you suppose it's cheating to pause the game at its conclusion so that we're protected from new challenges while we wait for D5 and Trydnt to finish?

	dlwillson: Hey. Sorry about the resignation. Real luge had intervened in a significant, non-positive way. I'll come back when I have time to play again. Sorry...
