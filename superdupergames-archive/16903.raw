	rootbier: pulling your only size 3 ship away from your homeworld is not the best idea. you're okay right now cuz i have no red at the moment. but otherwise - you'd have some big trouble.

	rootbier: My plan (as it stands) is to sacrifice that y2 at Gates to move in both my big guys. Having only the one little red you won't be able to take both of them. On the next turn I sacrifice my big red at home to attack with the remaining large ship and take three in your homeworld.
 
There is one thing you can do to stop me. Take time to think about it a while. Let me know if you don't sort it out.
	daselva: thank you for sharing your thoughts.I think the answer to your question is trade my y2 for a r2 in my HW.So if you came with your 2 big ones in my HW,I can sacrifice this r2 to attack both.Am I right?

36) rootbier: Build G1 Daselva
Catastrophe Daselva G
	rootbier: you are correct! well done.

37) daselva: Move Y1 S4 Rootbier

38) rootbier: Attack Y1 Rootbier
	rootbier: New threat. Pretty straightforward. See it?
	daselva: green catastrophe in my HW?

39) daselva: Build Y2 S4
	rootbier: Yeah.
 
But basically you're really behind the 8-ball (in a bad position) - cuz two moves from now I will cause that catastrophe anyway. And then I will start working on massing up ships for a yellow catastrope. It is too late to stop the green one - but you need to look for an opening to catastrophe my yellows as I build them - I may not give you that opening. (Or maybe I will just to test your awareness :) I haven't decided yet.)
	rootbier: Actually - it won't be two moves from now - I am going to take a little more time here to try to save time on building yellows later. Not sure that will help you but do your best.
 
And ask questions. If you are considering something and not sure if it is a good plan or not -- you can just ask.

41) daselva: Build Y3 S4

42) rootbier: Sacrifice Y3 Gates
Move B3 Gates Daselva
Move Y2 Gates Daselva
Move Y1 Dage Daselva
	rootbier: trouble. if you take one i just build with the other and call cat green. if you sac the r2 to take both i pull my sac y2 to move my two big guys in.
 
but don't worry - i get over eager and mess up often enough ;) you'll probably find a chink in my armor before it's over.
	daselva: playing this game with all your comments has been very useful for me to understand this game that I´m finding very interesting and very demanding(it´s hard to understand all it´s mechanics).I´m felling that g3 and y3 are the most important ships...in the actual situation I think I can´t do much to your attack.. .. 

43) daselva: Attack Y2 Daselva

44) rootbier: Trade B3 Y3 Daselva
Catastrophe Daselva Y
	rootbier: it's a very deep game. it moves slowly until things are set up and then... sacrifices make some quick things happen. always have to be looking for the trouble that might come from a sacrifice.
	rootbier: it isn't going to make a big difference this time... but you always want to note how movement/connection changes when one of the homestars gets wiped out - sometimes it will mean that the two home systems become directly connected - which can mean new opportunities and new trouble.

	rootbier: that simply won't do it man. though at this point - there was very little (maybe nothing) that would have.
