	wil: great place to increase skills....challenge a bunch of folk and then you'll have a move or two to make every day...(some folks don't check in so often, or take time making their moves) the format is not the best, the star systems and ships are allover the board....  in tricky situations set up a physical game to mirror so you don't miss anything!
