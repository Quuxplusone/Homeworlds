	caru: HEY SilentTitan, are you interested in playing a live session of Homeworlds on VASSAL?
	SilentTitan: could be ... what's VASSAL?

17) caru: Trade G2 Y2 Caru
	caru: VASSALengine is a java program which allows you to play online (real-time or email) all sort of board/dice/card games for which a module has been written (there are hundreds). It happens that a guy wrote a PiecePack module which includes IceHouse pyramids, so you can place pyramids on a virtual board (empty, chess or whatever) and rotate/move/stack/nest them as you like. Of course this board is shared with the other players.
I tested it alone and find it not complicated at all, should be fun, and you can virtually play all icehouse/piecepack games. Please let me know if you are interested. And if you need more info to get started quickly, just let me know that too ;)
1) download vassal for your platform
2) download piecepack module latest version
3) open it from file menu (select "show all files" to see it)
4) select "new offline game" from the wizard and start test moving pyramids around

i made some confusion though... let me fix it

2) download piecepack module latest version
2a) open vassal
3) open the module from file menu (select "show all files" to see it)
4) select "new offline game" from the wizard and start test moving pyramids around (you have to select "icehouse" in the toolbar to see pyramids and available colors)

	SilentTitan: ok.. so that's an error you can't recover from ... because you already undid your move.  However you should know that any one can call Catastrophe once there is four of any one color in a system. 
	SilentTitan: I'm going to go ahead and do the move like I had planned ... so you can see some stuph you wouldn't normally see in one of your early games


30) SilentTitan: Trade B3 R3 Silenttitan
	caru: Thanks, yep, I saw it too late... that's why I undid and get some friends home. Was there anything better I could have done?
	caru: Ah wait, now I remember why I thought that move in the first place... :)

31) caru: Trade R2 G2 Caru
	caru: And yes, this is my first game, so I only managed to plan the trap after you sacrificed your big green ship to get the two yellow ones. That's probably why I then immediately managed to forgot how the trap was supposed to work... :)

32) SilentTitan: Build B1 Silenttitan

	caru: gg SilentTitan!
