	Trydnt: good game. do you wanna log it or should I?
	speardane: I've already logged it... and then logged it again because I forgot how to get to the Tournament Viewer spreadsheet; and it looks like the spreadsheet didn't like that. :D  Good game! The relative placement of the r3 and g3 in my third-from-last move certainly doomed me, but that yellow monopoly was going to kill me eventually anyway.
	Trydnt: Yeah there was no way to stop me once I had all the yellow. Any 3 you flew to you'd be trapped on and so limited expansion and I made sure not to give you access to the 3 ships where possible. And cuz you couldn't move off those stars there was always the option of blowing them up to destroy a bunch of stuff
