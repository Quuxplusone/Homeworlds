Homeworlds Online (SDG# 14890)
Started: 2010.1.11, Ended: 2010.1.12
Participants: MaxL (S), TwoShort (N)
Winner: TwoShort

1) TwoShort: Homeworld R1 B3 G3

2) MaxL: Homeworld B1 G3 R3
	TwoShort: Howdy
	MaxL: Hi, this is my first game. I've read about it in the book but I'm just trying to learn.

3) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

4) MaxL: Build R1 Maxl
	TwoShort: I'll try to give you some pointers as we go...  for example, in future games, I'd recommend starting with a green ship.

5) TwoShort: Trade G1 Y1 Twoshort

6) MaxL: Trade R1 Y1 Maxl

7) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

8) MaxL: Discover Y1 Maxl B2 Beta

9) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort
	TwoShort: You probably wanted to grow again before moving out.  Having 4 colors (or at least Green and Yellow) at each world (or at least your Homeworld) lets you build faster.  

10) MaxL: Move Y1 Beta Maxl

11) TwoShort: Discover G1 Twoshort B2 Bluestar

12) MaxL: Build R1 Maxl

13) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

14) MaxL: Move R1 Maxl Bluestar

15) TwoShort: Build G2 Bluestar

16) MaxL: Attack G1 Bluestar

17) TwoShort: Discover G1 Twoshort G2 Grogar

18) MaxL: Move R3 Maxl Grogar

19) TwoShort: Sacrifice G3 Twoshort
Build G2 Grogar
Build G3 Bluestar
Build G3 Twoshort

20) MaxL: Attack G2 Grogar
	TwoShort: So there's why you wanted a G3 :)
	MaxL: Ohhhhh.
 
Bluebird mistake?

21) TwoShort: Sacrifice G2 Bluestar
Build G2 Grogar
Build Y1 Twoshort
Catastrophe Grogar Green
	TwoShort: No, the "Bluebird mistake" is having only one color ships in your homeworld when the opponent can move in enough to cause a catastrophe.
  What I just did, sacrificing a G3 to grow 3 ships, one of which is the same G3 back again, we call the "Factory".  If your opponent gets the factory going and you don't, you're in trouble. It's easiest to avoid that if you start with a g3 to begin with (and Green is a good color to have early anyway.)
  I believe Andy refers to "the prime directive": Don't leave your homeworld without a 3 point.
  And there's no special name for putting your only 3 point at a star the opponent can blow up, but...
	MaxL: No wait, Bluebird would be if I had all the same colour.

22) MaxL: Discover Y1 Maxl Y2 Gamma
	MaxL: woops
	MaxL: forgot about that
 
thanks for playing
	TwoShort: Weird, I didn't think it would let you abandon the Homeworld.  You couldn't have stopped me moving my g3 in then turning it red and taking over, so it wasn't long to go in any case.
I hope it wasn't too demoralizing :)  One's first game is pretty much certain to be a disaster, because early missteps are generally impossible to recover from.
  As a general guideline, try to concentrate at first on growing as efficiently as possible; the longer you can focus on expanding your forces rather than attacking the other guy, the better.
  I mostly ignore the final goal at first, and pretend the whole game is to see who has more 3 pointers when we run out of one or two colors in the stash.  If you win that race, you'll probably win the game.
