	mneme: Good game.

	AdamBadura: That was something I didn't expect. Sure I knew you could do that but I though that sacrificing 3-ship in early game is to much to make it worth. Somehow I skipped asking myself how would the board look like after that move.
 
You humiliated me. But I deserved that. Thanks for the lesson!
	mneme: You're welcome! I think, in a sense, everyone needs to get hit with this sort of "fool's mate" at some point in order to remember to make sure you never leave yourself in a position where you can be denied both yellow and blue.  I think I've been hit with it once and executed it twice.  Hopefully, the next game we play will be more interesting; I think you had a good position before you made the mistake of swapping to blue!
