	wil: I thought I was the only one crazy enough for that opening!
	sompm: Good luck.
 
I'm trying out a weird homeworld arrangement because I think it only rearranges the inevitable first three moves rather than restricting them, and it might help the endgame. We'll find out.

	sompm: Hey, I have to get rid of that dumb long-named planet somehow...
	sompm: I knew I played with someone who named planets after their piece (which actually does make things a lot easier, so I may pick up the practice), I just forgot who it was. I haven't yet tired of naming planets dumb jokes, but I'll keep it to other games so you don't have to type build g2 ApocryphalDeuterocanon or anything.
	wil: Yeah...some folks don't like it...for them I think about using g3 for b1...  I think the naming if some star systems long goofy names I'd to keep me from attacking!!

	wil: Lol...wrong move...I'll leave it alone...but it is over
	sompm: The temptation to (trade g3 b3 sompm) right now is real. But it would also result in immediately undoing it to avoid death.
