	Babamots: Yeah, I think red homestars are the way to go.
	capi3101: Wouldn't red homestars really be Strong Bads?
 
Never mind...
	capi3101: Best of luck.

7) capi3101: Build Y1 Capi3101
	Babamots: Maybe the first ship to leave home is the homestar runner.

	capi3101: I see the dirty factory move coming. Could've lost the y2 pretty easily just then.
	Babamots: A "dirty factory" was my planned response to a y2 invasion.
 
And by the way, can you think of a better term for that type of move? It should probably have "factory" in the name. "Dirty" is supposed to suggest that it's a mean trick and that it's not the "pure" type of factory, but I've never been quite happy with it.
	capi3101: That's the sort of question that would probably best be posed to the Homeworlds group on Facebook. At the very least you'd get more input on the matter than just me. Off the top of my head, I'd call it a 'shipwright'. 
 
Wouldn't necessarily call it a dirty move either...the 'dirty' version is the kind where you don't need an intervening move to reset the large ship to green. 'Poor Man's Factory' might be another possibility, I suppose.

	capi3101: Voltron reference?

22) Babamots: Move G1 Aldea Risa
	Babamots: https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Aldea
	capi3101: Ah, okay. Still a TNG reference then - got it.
	capi3101: I love how I can analyze the game for hours and hours, and then finally make exactly the wrong move...
	Babamots: I've been known to do that too.

	Babamots: I had a dream about this game last night. You killed me because I missed a Bluebird scenario.
	Babamots: (I also dreamed that I was playing StarCraft, but my probes were spinning wind-up toys that I couldn't get to mine minerals.)

29) capi3101: B G2 Aldea
	capi3101: We'll see if that was a premonition or not...
 
(Which faction, Humans or Protoss? I could totally see that...Zerg not so much...)
	Babamots: I was playing Protoss (usually my worst race).

30) Babamots: Sacrifice G3 Babamots

39) capi3101: Discover Y1 Babamots G3 Romeo

40) Babamots: Sacrifice G2 Bolarus
Build Y1 Andoria
Build Y3 Babamots
	capi3101: Now would probably be an ideal time for me to retreat, unfortunately. And then I've got a fairly substantial material disadvantage to deal with...I foresee the loss of green at my own star in the very near future.
	capi3101: Overall, I think that particular stratagem was ill-conceived...

41) capi3101: Build R1 Capi3101

42) Babamots: Move B1 Babamots Risa
	Babamots: I think losing three mediums to kill my g3 and g1 was probably not worth it for you. The g2's in b3 systems could have been nice investments for you later. I didn't really want to invade either one since they could green-teleport to each other.
 
As it is, I'll feel more comfortable with the yellows locked down.
	capi3101: Indeed...that limits my options. With disadvantages in yellow, large and overall material I'm seriously considered resigning now.
 
I'll go ahead and play it out; I've won games with a bad material disadvantage before. Granted, that wasn't against a player with your level of experience...
	capi3101: (+1 for awkwardly-worded sentences...)

43) capi3101: Trade R1 G1 Capi3101
	Babamots: Maybe I'll hatch a plan that relies on building ships from an empty supply :-D

44) Babamots: Build G2 Bolarus
	capi3101: You could do that...I'd probably appreciate it. ;)

45) capi3101: Discover G1 Capi3101 G2 Quebec

46) Babamots: Build G2 Bolarus
	capi3101: Hell.

47) capi3101: Build R1 Capi3101

48) Babamots: Build B2 Risa
	capi3101: Here it comes...

	Babamots: I miscalculated. I still have one more prep move.
	capi3101: Yeah, I see it. You need to get the two blues at Risa to a size 1 or 2 system. Then you've got a classic Doomsday Machine setup. Unfortunately for me, I'm too far behind to attempt to counter it. Taking out your large has cost me the game, it seems.
	capi3101: Was considering a hail mary but it would just end the game sooner. I think I'll quit now while my stars are still intact.
 
GG.
	Babamots: GG! And I think I will ask the Facebook group about a name for that move.
