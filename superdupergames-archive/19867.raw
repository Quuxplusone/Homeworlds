	goulo: that was an unexpected nice opportunity for me! :) i was rather expecting to maybe get to a catastrophe at Redundancy...
	AdamBadura: I screwed up that game so badly that I am ashame of my self. This makes me wonder whether I'm worthy buying Pyramids. ;)
	goulo: Only by owning the sacred pyramids and worshipping them every day will your spirit be able to grow, and thus you will grow stronger at Homeworlds. :)
	goulo: But seriously, I think we both made various silly errors. I am continually impressed by how subtle and deep and non-obvious this game is. Since it has a space empire theme, I sometimes find myself playing it with a "wargame" mentality instead of an "abstract strategy game" mentality, and that doesn't work well in Homeworlds. :)
