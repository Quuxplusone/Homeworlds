	Keith: Kenchi, this time your 11 days over.  If you are going to be unavailable, for the holidays or whatever, let us know so we wait with a purpose.  I will wait till January 2nd my time.

	Lexicon: Phew.  Glad that's not hanging over me anymore.  
	Lexicon: I'm frankly surprised you didn't nuke me already.
	Keith: I am so out of it in this game I am not sure what you are talking about Lexicon.  
	Keith: Congratulations Uglyfoot.  Sorry Lexicon.  I gave the game away.
 
I have definately decided that 4 player Homeworlds does not work for me.  80% of the time one of the four players is a no show or bails within a few turns.  I have never had a clear sense of how to proceed in the remaining multiplayer game and as such go nowhere.
	Lexicon: Aha!  This game went on pause for so long I forgot it was sinister.  Another reason 4 person games are bad. :(
	Uglyfoot: Thanks.  I can see where having one person either slow things down or skew it is bad.  For some reason I win a multiplayer (even when it is not delayed) but lose at two player.  Time to study this one more.
