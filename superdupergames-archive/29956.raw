	Draw5PlayAll: What is with this name "Dagoba"?
	Felix: @Draw5 - it's from Star Wars

21) Kalimantan: Move R1 Dagoba Flip
	Kalimantan: Lol. Yeah I'm butchering all the names I can remember from star wars systems. Like yarvin was supposed to be from yavin 4 but I misspelled it so now I just use yarvin all the time. I can't remember to many names of starsystems and star wars is pretty much the only exposure I've had to galactic warfare.

23) Kalimantan: Attack G1 Flip
	Felix: You need to watch some Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica!
	Kalimantan: Well I like startrek but I don't know of any memorable star systems. I was very young when I watched it. And I always saw as more about galactic exploration and diplomacy and not warfare. Battlestar galatica on the other I've just never actully watched it. I'm not sure why, maybe it was past my generation, I don't remember ever seeing on tv.

Catastrophe Kalimantan Red
	Felix: Watch out for that overpopulation threat! It's a killer. I know it was super tempting to attack my ship, but you left yourself open in your homeworld. 

	Kalimantan: Well I think I lost this match from the point where I made the g3, l thought it was a good move then but now in hindsight it seems like that's the precise moment I sealed my doom.  And hey who knows, maybe I would've fared better if I kept the pass. But I think I saw the catastrophe coming but there was really nothing I can do to stop it I think, can't quite remember now that the ships r gone.
	Felix: Yeah, that G3 might have been a mistake. It's difficult to work with a G3 in your homeworld if you also have green as one of your home stars, too. That said, you played well, and I hope you learned some things! I'd be happy to rematch any time :)
	Draw5PlayAll: Felix, was the no-blue homeworld a handicap thing? Because I have always found that a blue star is helpful (I have not tried a blue ship, but I prefer green ships). It helps me diversify the local defense fleet without having to go to blue stars or worry about keeping blues at home.
	Felix: @Draw5 it's generally considered more difficult to not have any blue at all at the start of the game. Since we both did it, neither of us were handicapped!
