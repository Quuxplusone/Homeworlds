	ts52: I think I'm old enough that I should know the reference, and I know the phrase, but I'm don't actually know off hand where exactly it's from.
Thanks for the game!
	wil: Butt kicked...thanx!!  More stuff to watch out for.  If you are up for another give me a challenge and I'll gladly play, get whipped and learn some more.  Hopefully one day i'll be able to give you a proper run for your money....
 
Rope a Dope was what Muhamed Ali did in boxing, stood on the ropes getting pummelled watching for overconfidence, tiring, a mistake, an opening to capitalize on....of course with him...he had two things I don't...skill and intent..he did it with intent...I did it because I was not skillful and boxed into  a corner...
