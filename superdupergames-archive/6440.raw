nycavri: Homeworlds is a fascinating game when I don't needlessly handicap myself.

19) nycavri: Trade B1 Y1 Nycavri
zoltar: Yes, I know the feeling. Right now I'm playing against a much better player, and he already has the upper hand after 5 moves and is into the middle sized pieces as I am here, and is going to get a bigger advantage, and I have no idea where I went wrong. The game seems to have the complexity almost of chess, though it is mostly tactics.

29) nycavri: Trade Y1 G1 Nycavri
zoltar: How was that for a sophisticated tactical move: I sacked my g2, grew the last y3, then grew my g2 back in the system with all your pieces and created a catastrophe, leaving a simplified position where I have 3 extra large ships!

30) zoltar: Discover Y2 Blueberry G2 Greenbelt
nycavri: Yes, but I thought you were going to blow up my y2 planet, so we'll call it a push. *grin*
zoltar: I had that choice, but this way I had such a material advantage at the end that it seemed to be a much safer move, and now you even had to spend a move to stop the threat to your yellow star; the other way, I take out one of your binary stars, but you have the Y3 which you could do trouble with.
nycavri: I'm still expecting to lose, but at least now it will take a couple of turns longer. I hope.....

31) nycavri: Move Y2 Nycavri Blueberry

32) zoltar: Sacrifice R2 Blues

zoltar: Well, I'm playing slowly now, spreading out my forces so I can build up more forces before I attack.

35) nycavri: Discover R3 Nycavri Y1 May

36) zoltar: Trade Y3 R3 Blueberry

37) nycavri: Move R3 May Nycavri
zoltar: That is an insane move, leaving your homeworld undefendend. You're lucky that I don't have any red pieces!

38) zoltar: Sacrifice G3 Blues
Build G3 Blues
Build R1 Blueberry
Build Y1 Blueberry
nycavri: You're just toying with me now - you can blow me up almost at will. The fact is you have no Reds, and I'm going to try and steal a move from you somewhere to try and make some sort of comeback. Again, not expecting it to work, but what do I have to lose?
zoltar: Well, if you don't run your r3 back to your homeworld, it's all over.
nycavri: Yup. I keep looking for you to make a mistake, but no.....

Catastrophe Nycavri G
zoltar: Too bad you don't have another y1 ship, or you'd be threatening "the blueberry" checkmate, as all my homeworld ships are green (the ideal setup would be to have a large green and one other ship red, so all four colors are represented, and no more than one of each color for maximum stability. I haven't traded, say my g2 to r2, which I would have done the move after I built the third green ship, only because you didn't have any yellow tech to reach it.
zoltar: Sorry, that would be called the 'bluebird' checkmate, when you sacrifice to move to an opponent's homeworld where they have only one color, and you destroy all of their ships

zoltar: Here the story from the Homeworlds World Champion himself:

zoltar: And look for the video called "The Bluebird Mistake"
zoltar: Well, gg again. You're doing great as a beginner. Took me a dozen games till I won one, as this is hard, like chess, but worth the initial frustration as it's a wonderful fun game.
nycavri: Thanks. This is one of the few gamse I seem to enjoy even when being trounced. Looking forward to eventually being able to teach this face to face - I imagine it's even *more* fun with players getting into the space opera theme.
