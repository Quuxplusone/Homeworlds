Participants: foksieloy (S), fogus (N)
Winner: foksieloy

1) fogus: Homeworld R1 B2 G3
	foksieloy: Hi! Have fun, if you have questions, ask. :)
	fogus: Thank you.  Will do.

2) foksieloy: Homeworld G1 B3 Y3

3) fogus: Build G1 Fogus
	fogus: I totally went with Andrew Looney's opening move without fully understanding why.  I suspect that I'll get it as I get more (some) games under my belt.

4) foksieloy: Build Y1 Foksieloy
	foksieloy: The homeworld setup you are playing is called a banker. It involves quickly using g1 ships to "reserve" large pieces in the form of stars to later build by sacrificing the g1 ship (since the star returns to the stash if no ships are present). I anticipated that, so that is why g1 is in my system as opposed to b1. It reduces the number of g1 ships you can build without giving me access to g2.

5) fogus: Trade G1 Y1 Fogus

6) foksieloy: Trade Y1 G1 Foksieloy

7) fogus: Build G1 Fogus

8) foksieloy: Build G2 Foksieloy
	fogus: How long have you been playing?  My son and I have played a few games, but I never felt that I knew what I was doing.  I very much appreciate your taking the time to play/discuss with me.
	foksieloy: Not long truth be told, played a bit with family and recently joined here. But had (and still have) a lot of parallel games here, been reading a bit on forums, and just generally analyzing the game. I have a tendency to learn quickly. In its essence this is a resource management game. Here is something that might help you at first: consider each ship pip to be 1 point, and each distance that the ship is closer to the enemy homeworld is 1 point more. So a g2 in your system is 2 points, a g1 next to the enemies system is 4 points. And then try to keep your score growing while not allowing the opponent to do the same. It is a solid abstraction for the beginning of learning the game.

9) fogus: Trade G1 B1 Fogus
	foksieloy: Just a warning, you might not see it but if you build a green ship now, you lose the game. Just a fair warning. :)
	fogus: The pip-scoring is a nice idea.  Thanks.
	fogus: Can you say more about the dangers of another green ship?  I know about catastrophes, but I thought it was 4 of the same color.

10) foksieloy: Trade G2 R2 Foksieloy
	foksieloy: You would have 3 green ships . I sacrifice my y3. I move my g1 to your system and declare catastrophe green. You only have y1 left. I just need to get my 2pip ship into your system and it is game over (and I can get it there within 3 turns), and 3 turns is not enough for you to reach a 2 pip ship.

11) fogus: Discover Y1 Fogus R3 Abalone
	fogus: Wow!  So cool.  Way deeper than I can see ATM.
	fogus: Hmm, I'm beginning to see how I'm at a disadvantage for ship size.

12) foksieloy: Build R1 Foksieloy

13) fogus: Build G1 Fogus
	foksieloy: A y3 ship is quite good as a pressure strategy, your opponent is constantly evaluating whether to go or not to go over 2 pyramids of same color in system. And yes, I am trying to lock your out of mediums. This is the main advantage of the Goldilocks start (x1 and x3): good control over 2pip, and through that over 3pip.
	foksieloy: Also, happy new year!

14) foksieloy: Build G2 Foksieloy

15) fogus: Trade B1 Y1 Fogus
	fogus: Happy new year to you too. :-)

16) foksieloy: Trade G2 B2 Foksieloy

17) fogus: Move G1 Fogus Abalone

18) foksieloy: Build G2 Foksieloy

19) fogus: Build G2 Abalone

20) foksieloy: Trade G2 B2 Foksieloy

21) fogus: Build G2 Fogus

22) foksieloy: Discover B2 Foksieloy Y2 Nurgle

23) fogus: Trade Y1 R1 Fogus

24) foksieloy: Build Y1 Foksieloy
	fogus: My ham-handed attempt at a catastrophe was thwarted, so instead I thought it wise to try and get a G2.  However, I have no clear vision of a strategy at the moment.  Do you mind sharing your thoughts?

25) fogus: Build R2 Fogus
	foksieloy: At the moment I am trying to lock you out of blue to limit your color mobility (switching to colors you need). This is putting me at a slight disadvantage with green which I now intend to start working on. Your best bet at the moment might be to pressure me into giving you a g3 and get some presence in a size 2 system to threaten invasion of my homeworld.
