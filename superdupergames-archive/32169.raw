Started: 2017.5.16, Ended: 2017.5.28
Participants: wil (S), Felix (N)
Winner: Felix

1) Felix: Homeworld B1 R3 G3

2) wil: H G2 B1 B3 *
	Felix: Here we go! I'll give you the opportunity to open with a blue rush, should you wish to do so. I'm curious what options are open for defending against it.
	wil: I'll play, I like this.  
	wil: Frankly I think the issue is when do you turn your g3 to blue...
	wil: Frankly I think the issue is when do you turn your g3 to blue...
	wil: Frankly I think the issue is when do you turn your g3 to blue...

3) Felix: Build G1 Felix

4) wil: B B1 Wil
	Felix: Right.... I think some experimentation is in order. It probably would have been smarter for me to use a y3 instead of an r3, so I can diversify more quickly.

5) Felix: Trade G3 B3 Felix

6) wil: T B3 Y3 Wil
	Felix: Oh why not?

7) Felix: Build B2 Felix
	wil: Could be this is Ynot?

8) wil: B B2 Wil

9) Felix: Trade B3 Y3 Felix

10) wil: T B1 R1 Wil
	Felix: Y, don't mind if I do

11) Felix: Build G1 Felix

	Felix: So, I'm not sure you benefited much from that opening this time around. I think trading for that B3 on the second turn might be the best way to counteract that blue rush attack.
	Draw5PlayAll: Then P2 sacs the Y3 and throws a B1 at the homeworld.
	wil: D5p√†...  You are peanutting....  Members of the peanut gallery are allowed to watch and discuss.things amongst themselves but not make comments which can affect the outcome of a game.

	Draw5PlayAll: Uh oh, I think he hibernated again.

	wil: Another day
