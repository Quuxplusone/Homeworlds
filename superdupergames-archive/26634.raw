	hellajoey: Hey, Larry. I have an Android question: Do you have experience with pinch-to-zoom or panning? I've started working on a Homeworlds player in my spare time. I've implemented both pinch-to-zoom and panning but there are some problems. The biggest issue is I need to be able to pan or zoom out and see parts of the board that started outside of the screen window but anything that starts outside of the screen window gets chopped off once it's moved into the screen window. Does that make sense? I'd really like to be able to accomplish this without having to know how big the game view is going to be since it will be built dynamically.
 
Any ideas? Also, how's eBay and how's life? 
	Grissom: Hi Joey, eBay is good I'm really enjoying it. I do have some experience with pinch to zoom and panning but it is a bit difficult to make sense of it without seeing the code. Do you have a git project? I would be interested in contributing. Regardless I would recommend looking into an existing library like a pinch to zoom image view and reviewing how they handle drawing the bitmap.

	hellajoey: Thanks, Larry. I don't think the project is in the place where I want to open it up yet. It's still a little haywire until I figure out how I want the visuals to work. I'll keep you posted though. Once I have a general player working there will still be a lot of work to make it awesome. Glad things are going well at eBay. Miss you guys.
