51) Trydnt: Move R3 Why3 Fungus
	Trydnt: You gotta watch out at the start for resets that basically take us back in time but leave your opponent just a point or two ahead. It can make all the difference. Out of curiosity, why do you like goldilocks?
	eliscinsky: I still consider myself a newbie at HWs.  So I'm trying several different strategies in my games to see what works best for me. I saw that you didn't create your HW to include R, so I thought I would try to capture the economy.  It backfired.  My curiosity, how long have you been playing HWs? I see you're currently undefeated, and in 2018 you were 7 out of 11.

52) eliscinsky: Discover B1 Fungus R3 Mars
	eliscinsky: BTW, just because I consider myself a newbie, I've only really played HWs in the Tournament `18 & `19, don't take it easy on me. ;) I love learning from my mistakes. :D  Love learning strategies used against me. 
	Trydnt: I started playing in 2017 so shortly before you. I had the great fortune of being taught by Wil who is also an excellent player and amazing teacher. We lived close to each other and the Looneys so got to practice against the creators and some of the best players quite a lot in the early days. You have the right mindset though. A loss is only a failure if you learned nothing from the experience. I stopped paying so much attention to wins and loses and focused instead on how to learn as much from each game as possible.

	eliscinsky: This is becoming pointless. I yeild to your superior numbers, position, and ability.  If you agree I'll just resign.  Otherwise it may take a dozen moves or so, but in the end you'll take me anyway.  Is there a difference ranking / point wise in defeating an opponent vs. a resignation?  I'd like you to get the best ranking out of this.
 
I tip my hat to you good sir, well played! Cheers!
