Move G3 Bluestar Arcturus
Move G3 Arcturus Lambda
	lambda: OK, I realized right as I hit the submit button that I had an instant kill for you, so I hit undo. But now I feel bad killing you in that way after undoing a move. Do you think I should take my kill? Or do you want to undo your last move? Or do you think I should just redo my move? Basically, I feel bad killing you after an undo that wasn't because I mistyped, but instead because I realized a second later that I had a better move. 
	TwoShort: My general feeling on undos is that if you realize a second later you have a better move, feel free; if it's the next day, better to ask.  I would have loved (and not hesitated) to hit undo in our previous game, when I realized as I hit the submit button that I'd made a dumb game losing mistake.  Now I've made the exact same mistake, and not realized it, so I'm feeling kind of dumb!
  I propose that I've no idea what is the most fair way to proceed, but I'm sure the most fun way is to undo both our moves and continue from there.

24) lambda: Move G3 Sol Lambda
	TwoShort: Of course, now I'll feel bad if I win quickly after that

	lambda: Well, there's another move I'd like to undo. I guess I'll let it stand, though. 
	lambda: Not immediately, but...

25) TwoShort: Build G2 Yellonia
	lambda: Ouch. 
	lambda: I think no matter what, we're going to have to have a rematch after this game, since we've each made such bad mistakes.
