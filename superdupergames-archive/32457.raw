	Ausmuh: You are braver then I! I am always gun shy to take the last 1-pip. I also get locked out of color often that way. 

10) Felix: Trade R2 Y2 Felix
	Felix: Yeah... sometimes you have to! In this case, if I had traded for the y1 instead of the r1 on my second turn, you could have easily locked me out of red. Not a good situation to be in!

23) Ausmuh: Move Y2 Zed Troid
	Felix: Maybe! The fruit is just out of reach though. It's tricky to get to them without allowing you to get to them too :P

Catastrophe Ausmuh Green
	Felix: It doesn't look great for you... but you might get out of this yet!
	Ausmuh: Beautiful red catastrophe. :) That hurts!

46) Felix: Move Y1 Troid Zed

47) Ausmuh: Trade B1 R1 Ausmuh
	Felix: Thank you! It was a costly move, though. 
	Ausmuh: oh wow, i think you could have moved your 3 pip in from your HW to lock in the win. I would have been lacking the attack to defend. Maybe I'm wrong but I'll take it! :)

48) Felix: Sacrifice Y3 Felix
Move Y1 Mega Ausmuh
Move Y1 Mega Ausmuh
Move Y1 Zed Ausmuh
Catastrophe Ausmuh Yellow
	Felix: That would have been one pathway to get there! ;) It would have taken two moves for me either way, I think, but catastrophes are always more fun. Great game!
	Ausmuh: Good game! You're right, catastrophes are sweet! See you on the next one!
