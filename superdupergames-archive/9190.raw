19) TwoShort: Attack G1 Twoshort
	Visible: how exactly are draws handled?
	TwoShort: In more draw-prone games (e.g. Fanorona) there's a button to offer a draw; I guess it hasn't come up enough in Homeworlds.  We'd have to get Aaron to do it manually.  But actually now I'm wondering if I can stop you...  This is a freaky game :)

22) Visible: Sacrifice G1 Twoshort
Build Y1 Visible
	Visible: sorry for the undo. forgot to actually cause my catastrophe... ;)
I think you would have been better off sac'ing your 3r and taking all 3 of my ships.
	Visible: MAN this game is fun. :)

23) TwoShort: Trade R1 G1 Twoshort
	TwoShort: I couldn't sac the 3, it was my only ship and I'd have had nothing to actually perform the attack actions with.

24) Visible: Trade Y1 R1 Visible
	Visible: ooooh yeah. hmmm.
	TwoShort: Oh... and don't worry about the undo; I personally don't see any problem with undoing even just because I see a better move.
