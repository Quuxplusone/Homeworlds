	dlwillson: So much going on! I have to get out the plastic now. Sorry for the delay.
	mneme: heh.  I try not to take it quite that seriously. :)
	dlwillson: My ladder-match took a sudden turn, so I have to use my plastic for that match. So... I guess I'll follow your lead and take this one less seriously. I'll play the best I can from the screen, and hope you'll excuse me if I disappoint you. :-)

	mneme: I meant the r3 entry into my home.  I'm not sure you had a choice at that point--but it did make the endgame relatively trivial.  I think I had a solid endgame even without that, though (although running an endgame with no large ships in my home system is interesting.

	dlwillson: Not that it matters much, but I don't like passing, and we're within a turn of the end anyway.
	mneme: I think playing out your home system and hoping I blunder might have been better.  If I made a mistake on the blue kill you might get tempo for an attack on my home system.
	dlwillson: Again?
	dlwillson: And I disagree with you about the potential of playing to regain control of my home-system. I saw that option, and I don't think your win would have been any more difficult. I would have had to sac my R3 to get i, then all you have to do is swap B3 to Y3, ignore my next turn, because it can't get me a multi-pip R, and come in with two B3. Done either way. The R3 seemed to me to have more chances for you to make a mistake, which I needed, due to your massive material advantage.
	mneme: Fair enough; I'm not going to spend too much time on post-analysis right now anyway.  The issue with coming in with two b3 is if you can get two b in your home system, in which case my attack can be easily repelled.
 
Totally again.
