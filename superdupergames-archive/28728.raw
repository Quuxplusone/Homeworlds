	endo: The green situation was quite nasty in any case... Had you traded your G3, I would simply have built it and the larges would go 3-1 for me. You couldn't have moved it away either, because then I could invade with my extra large as usual.
 
Situations like this are the reason I almost always play with a green ship. The problem with having your ship in some other color is not that you don't have a G3 (which you can obtain via trade), but that you DO have a green star, which will become a huge liability once you get the G3. Green is the color of the large you need in the early game. Once you get more larges, you can house the Y3's and R3's you'll then need at stars other than your homeworld, where your yellow or red half-star won't be a problem.
 
I see a green ship is what you've been playing in all your previous games, I just thought I'd elaborate a bit on why it's important to do that :)

37) Felix: Discover G1 Felix Y2 Obelisk
	Felix: Wow, thanks for the in-depth tip! That's really helpful, and I definitely get what you're talking about. I have noticed that players start with a green ship 90% of the time. When I play games like this, however, I often want to try to use less-used strategies and ideas. I think it's fun to "go against the grain" and do things differently. However, sometimes there's a very good reason nobody does things a certain way! And I can tell that having green in my home system is a big liability, so I'll avoid it in the future. Thanks very much for the tip. I have learned!
