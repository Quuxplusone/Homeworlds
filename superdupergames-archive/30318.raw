	Draw5PlayAll: Our planet has become inhospitable and we rigged the Auto-Destruct to explode the empty starship if it was not destroyed by our [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION NOT DISCLOSED]
	Felix: We are glad to hear that we helped solve your tribble problem. However, when our first aid vessels entered the sector they discovered that the small red star remaining was also infested with tribbles. Our medical ships are also equipped with nuclear warheads, so we went ahead and took care of the tribble trouble for you. Unfortunately, the extermination process also destroyed your remaining home planet. Sorry about that...
	Draw5PlayAll: We do not mind. Anyone still alive at the time of the first catastrophe was already in the Galaxy-class warp ship when the second hit. We need a new planet to settle on, but we can survive on the large ship for a few years.
 
I wish the defense system was better, but every time they try to give me one, it repels our own ships during tests.
