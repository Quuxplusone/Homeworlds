30) capi3101: Sacrifice Y1 Gimel
Move Y1 Gimel Babamots
	capi3101: Ugh. Here's where the difference in ship strength is going to bite me in the butt. And boy howdy is there a difference - 17 to 10 pips alone (not counting the homeworld larges).
	capi3101: Letting you get the large yellow is going to cost me the game, I think. If I move out one small yellow at Gimel, you get the other one. If, however, I sacrifice a medium yellow to move both out, you build it right back. If I squonk the one small yellow to move the other, you build that one instead.
	capi3101: You're still relatively immobile for now though. Trying to figure out how to keep it that way...
	capi3101: Naw, I can't keep you immobile. You've got more large ships that me; that's bad in and of itself.
	capi3101: Well, let's get this over with then.

31) Babamots: Trade B3 R3 Babamots
	Babamots: In my strategy guide, I ranked "Large ship majority" one step stronger than "Yellow ship majority." Looks like this game may bear out that principle.

32) capi3101: Build Y1 Babamots

33) Babamots: Move R3 Risa Aleph
	capi3101: Yes, I need to attempt to disperse my fleet if possible. Meanwhile...

34) capi3101: Sacrifice Y2 Aleph
Move Y1 Aleph Risa
Move Y1 Risa Babamots
Catastrophe Babamots Y
	Babamots: You may take my yellow star, but you'll never take my greeeeeeen oooooooone!
	capi3101: Probably not. But at least I'll feel good about myself for a little bit...

35) Babamots: Sacrifice Y3 Risa
Move B3 Gimel Aleph
Move B3 Aleph Capi3101
Move R3 Aleph Capi3101

	capi3101: Hang on. You moved before I was looking.
	capi3101: Aw....
	capi3101: ...and now that good feeling is gone all of a sudden. Crapbiscuit.
	Babamots: GG! And I can tell you're getting stronger. Was it five months ago you'd never even played? The practice is paying off!
	capi3101: I'd played before, just not for a ~very~ long time. Like, around the time this version of the game was still called Binary Homeworlds, just after it evolved out of IceTraders...
	capi3101: Pretty sure I lost this one when you got the large yellow. Not dipping into blue at any point also hurt, since I couldn't do much to keep you from getting the big blues. I suppose I might've traded out my large yellow at home for one at some point.
	capi3101: Ah well. GG.
