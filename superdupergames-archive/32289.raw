	Draw5PlayAll: I think you have me cornered.
	Draw5PlayAll: I think my mess up was allowing you two Y3s.

	Felix: Good game though. I honestly didn't think I'd have a shot with a duplicate-star homeworld. According to most of what I've read, it's supposed to be suicide.
	Draw5PlayAll: When I made that earlier comment (G2 = Altair, etc) I was referring to the system the Homeworlds Theater videos use... but I would hope this game does not end up on the video... or really any of mine, even those that I won.
	Felix: Ah, I see. I've never heard of Homeworlds Theater. Why wouldn't you wanna be on it?
