8) MatrixFrog: Discover Y2 Matrixfrog G1 Bing
	Wheatberry: Oh snap! Can you use sacrifice actions sequentially? i.e. could you sacrifice your Y3 to make 3 jumps in a row with a single piece? i.e. can you send your y1 out to discover a small star, then send it from *there* to discover a large star, then move it from *there* into my homeworld, triggering a catastrophe on yellow?
	MatrixFrog: I could indeed, however, I probably won't do something that drastic, this early in the game. I would probably use my smallest ship to do that, which is y1 here. So I would be left with a single y2. On the other hand, you would be left with a single b3, plus a 1-star homeworld, which is easier for me to get to. So maybe it would be worth it. I won't do it now, in any case, but you should probably move one of your y ships out or trade them, pretty soon.
