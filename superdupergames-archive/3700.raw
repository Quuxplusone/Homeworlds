zoltar: As you can see, I'm clueless about openings, and took back and changed both moves so far. Except that I so far have always started with some b-g-y combo, as it seems only in advanced strategy could an early red be helpful, perhaps to force the opponent to waste time trading and getting reds to maintain the balance.
fnord: Yeah.. .the strategy guide I read said that Reds weren't that useful until mid-game, at the earliest, since at the beginning of the game you should worry about developing your fleet.

zoltar: Yes, the game is wonderfully complex, and we have to weigh getting big pieces, getting all colors, and not having too many of one color in one place. The trick with the G3 I learned from the games I lost; it's called "The Factory", where I have a G3 and just one other green in a system, and there are no small greens and no more than 2 medium greens in the stash. Then you can sack the G3, rebuild it in place with the other small green, and you get two other builds, meaning two builds instead of one, anywhere you have ships.
zoltar: Well, while I could have just overpowered your last defender, I thought I'd do one more sac and end with a big bang, since you couldn't do it!
