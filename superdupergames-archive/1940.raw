Winner: JunkMan

1) andylooney: Homeworld B3 G2 Y3
	twopercentright: um...hello?
	twopercentright: I was told this is good place to learn the icehouse games for when i have to demo for Con

	SYSTEM: twopercentright resigns.

2) JunkMan: Homeworld G1 B2 Y3

3) andylooney: Build Y1 Andylooney
	andylooney: so what happened here? Did 2%right just quit? or what? I guess we can play this out as a two player game...

4) JunkMan: Build Y1 Junkman
	JunkMan: I think he resigned right off the bat.  Maybe he hit the wrong button or something.  Darn, I think I had better odds having to eliminate him.

5) andylooney: Trade Y1 G1 Andylooney
	andylooney: Well, our board is all goofy and there are too many pieces in the bank. This isn't the game I had in mind. I'd be happy to just kill it, but I don't want to resign for fear of hurting my rating. Maybe we can get Aaron to just cancel this game?

6) JunkMan: Trade Y1 R1 Junkman
	JunkMan: I don't mind either way.  I don't think resigning would hurt your rating though, because it's supposed to be a three player game.  I'd definately check with aaron to be sure, though.

	andylooney: Oh, you're right - this should be an unrated game. Well, I'm gonna bag this then. If you want to play me 2 player, grab the game I have open. Thanks!
	SYSTEM: andylooney resigns.
