30) AdamBadura: Build R2 Adambadura
	Aristos: My main thrust has been to acquire enough yellow tech to knock out your big yellow ship. I finally had enough on hand.
	Aristos: You really threw me off at the start... I've never played a game with identically sized homeworlds before. It is a very different game when the worlds are so close.
	AdamBadura: I missed that move to which is kind of wired considering how much time did I take to make my move. (I had few attempts but after some thinking I wasn't sure what should I do.)
 
In general it is bad to have identical worlds. It is bad for the second player (me) since the first player has an advantage. I didn't want to make them so but did it by accident just reverting your sizes and forgetting that I had to actually change one of them.

31) Aristos: Sacrifice Y1 Morph
Move R3 Shipyard Adambadura

	Aristos: I've got you now. If you do anything other than change color in your home system, I build red and cause catastrophe. So you must change color. Regardless of what color you pick, I attack your size 2 ship. You build a new ship the next turn or you lose. I sacrifice my size 3 and attack both ships. Game over.
	AdamBadura: You are right. Somehow I hoped there will be a little race with building ships. I wanted to build an R3 in your home system. But appearently that was a bad plan.
 
Yet I'm not sure if it could have ended otherwise considering my previous mistakes.
 
Thanks for the game and I'm terribly sorry for the delays. :(
	Aristos: Thanks. No problem on the delays. Take care.
