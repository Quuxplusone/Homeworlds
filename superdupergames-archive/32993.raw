	Draw5PlayAll: So this is that tournament where you play 7 rounds followed by a double elimination? I think it will be at least 18 months and maybe 2 years before it is over. And the ladder is already annoying enough!
	wil: Seriously?  Just cause you don't wanna play you wanna annoy us during our game?  Comment all you want on games you are involved in...but I am formally asking younto refrain from butting in and commenting on my games you are not involved in.   Is this too much to ask?
	wil: Your intrusions in my games like this fits the definition of annoying.
