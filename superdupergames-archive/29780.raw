35) ts52: Move R1 Ts52 Gonzo
	ts52: That
	ts52: That's awesome! We started when my youngest was 3 or so, I don't think I'd be brave enough to try camping with a 6 month old. Well done!

36) Felix: Move Y2 Grass Gonzo
	Felix: Thanks! It wasn't the easiest or most relaxing camping trip, but we made it work! She co-sleeps with my wife, so the two of them just slept in a hammock together. I was impressed they pulled it off!
	Felix: Next time we're going to try out this cool tent we got called a "Tentsile Connect" tree tent. It's a tent that you suspend from trees kind of like a hammock. Should be a bit more comfy than the ground, but we'll see.
