	wil: I have never played John Cooper...but John Cooper has changed my game play dramatically.   Andy came back from the JoCo cruise last year saying he got to play a number of games with John...and that John has a very aggressive game play....so I began attacking stars that others created... it is obnoxious, but it works...   
	Laurie_Menke: It works for you!  I tried that on Andy and it cost me my current game, I think.  :/  I just need a lot more practice...
	Laurie_Menke: Hmmm...  I think I should concede this game.  Congratulations, and Happy Birthday!!!  (Don't say I never gave you anything.)  ;)  ;)  ;)
	wil: Andy is such a tricky player... he's seen it all..and comes up with moves that I baffle me at times when I think I have him cornered.
	wil: Musta been ts52's birthday too...
	Laurie_Menke: LOL... musta been...  ;)   And yes, he is tricky!
	Laurie_Menke: Actually, I guess it was mine... did you see how that turned out?  :)
	wil: Yeah, I am surprised neither of you saw that...it was sittin there and he moved and you moved and he moved...  I was bouncin off the walls!
	Laurie_Menke: So weird.  I don't know why I didn't see it, either!
	wil: That was why I said it must've been his birthday...  

	Laurie_Menke: Gotcha.  :)
