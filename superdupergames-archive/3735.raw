zoltar: Aggression on only the 4th move, eh?
Keith: I was trying to keep you away from a y2. Since in our first game you taught me how inconvenient it can be to be yellow poor (or broke). Besides, it was only a little one. A defensive move.

12) zoltar: Build G2 Zoltar

13) Keith: Trade Y3 G3 Keith
Keith: Once again you are racing up a color track while I struggle to get one.

zoltar: Well, you ended up kicking my butt last game, so I'm not so confident.
Keith: I am going to have to shut it down for the night soon. It is 1:3AM where I am and I have a fence to build tomorrow in the cool of the morning before it get hot. BTW what time is it where you are?
zoltar: And I'm sure you'll send some jihadist into the delta quadrant and blow up all my extra greens before I can do anything about it.

Keith: Maryland?

21) Keith: Move Y3 Keith Brickroad
Keith: And here I was all set to sacrifice my Y3 to eliminate your G3s and give us a game with no large ships in play.
Keith: This looks like a good point to stop and think. That and it is 2:00AM.
zoltar: Yes, the one in Maryland, not the one on Beta Lyra.
zoltar: Ok, goodnight. Hopefully we can continue tomorrow.
Keith: Whitsett, North Carolina is my location. Tomorrow night then if not sooner.

zoltar: Elton John's "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" plays in the background as splinters of Yellow Bricks go flying in all directions....
Keith: Oh wow. One mistake after another on my part. Somehow I had the idea I was safe from a yellow catastrophe. Three large ships to my none. Six ships to my two. The end is just a matter of time. I will hold off a turn or two before I resign.

30) zoltar: Trade G3 Y3 Zoltar

31) Keith: Trade G2 R2 Keith
zoltar: Yes, I was going to move my g2 into your homeworld, and then if you captured it, move the other g2 in and blow up your star; or if you captured the other g2 on BrickRoad, sac my g1 on gamma and rebuild it in your homeworld and still blow up the star. But with my g2 ship and my y1 I could build the 4th yellow to supernova; furthermore I had a finesse by sacking the g2, building the y1, and then rebuilding the (would be) doomed g2 back in my homeworld, thus giving me yet another piece. The overwhelming lead in development now is surely better than knocking out your green star but leaving you with lots of ships and counterplay.
zoltar: Had you captured my y1 (to stop me from supernoving the Y3 star) instead of my r1, then with my r1 I could have captured it right back, except that you sacked an r1 for the attack and I didn't, so that we're in the same position again except you're missing your r1 (ditto with capturing a g2 instead). I think your only defence was to run back your y3 to your homeworld 2 moves ago. Now I'm really getting why they say always leave a 3-pip ship in your homeworld unless you have an extraordinary good reason to move or sac it.

32) zoltar: Trade G3 B3 Zoltar
Keith: I am going to take a quick time out to issue some Cannon challanges now that is back online.

33) Keith: Build Y1 Keith
zoltar: Well, you can play with your cannons -- I'm going to get one of each color so I have a complete team, and a solid base to build my forces!
