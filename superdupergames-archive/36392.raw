Winner: amoscai

1) amoscai: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3
	amoscai: hi
	amoscai: I generally see people start with yellow and blue home and a g3. 
	Babamots: Hi! Good to meet you! Did you take my "learning game" challenge? If so, how much advice would you like? I can be pretty talkative, but I don't want to give too much away if you only want occasional hints.
 
Yes, a blue-yellow home with green ship is a popular start. I prefer a blue-red home with a green ship most of the time, but I just lost a game to a blue-yellow home, so what do I know? :-D
 
Looks like you've played about a dozen HW games here on SDG. Have you played some games elsewhere, or is that your full experience?
	amoscai: this is my full experience. heh. need to get more plays because I feel pretty 'beginner'. Yes. I am open to however much you think is useful for both of us.
	Babamots: Just FYI, the players who have "standing challenges" on SDG are usually pretty good. I see you just played wil and Trydnt, who are both very strong players.
 
If you're having a hard time finding players who match your skill level, you can try this page:
 
http://superdupergames.org/main.html?page=listusers
 
The page loads super slowly, but it has a score for each HW player as well as when they were last on the site (so you can find someone who's active).
	amoscai: thanks for that! sorry I didn't log in for so long. I usually only check when I get the email notification that it's my turn.

2) Babamots: Homeworld G3 B1 B3 *

3) amoscai: Build G1 Amoscai
	Babamots: So you know, I'm trying to "instafreeze" you out of blues. Before too long, you'll probably need to trade your g3 for b3 to prevent me from running away with the whole blue stash, larges and all.
 
By chance, we actually chose the exact same homeworld setups that I used for my tactics guide on instafreezes here:

	amoscai: wow. fantastic. thanks!

15) amoscai: Trade G2 Y2 Amoscai
	Babamots: You should notice that you're in what I call a blue soft-freeze. You have a blue ship, but if you build another one, there's a danger of me overpopulating your home with blue. That wouldn't be the end of the world since it would cost me my only large ship as well, but make sure you're prepared for that if you build a b3.
	amoscai: yeah. I thought about that (: thanks for pointing it out. soft-freeze. I like that term.

16) Babamots: Build B3 Babamots

17) amoscai: Build G2 B3
	Babamots: I also like that "soft-freeze" reminds me of soft-serve ice cream or a Slurpee.

18) Babamots: Discover B2 Iconia G3 Risa

19) amoscai: Build G2 Amoscai
	Babamots: I'm considering destroying your blue star and b3 ship on my next turn. That would connect our homes, and since I would be the only one with a large, I'd probably be able to win pretty soon after that.
 
Your best defense is probably to trade your b3 for another color, but that does give me a chance to build another b3 ships. You could also move your b3 out of your home, but that leaves your home without a defending large. I'm afraid you'll have to pick between some not-so-great choices.

20) Babamots: Sacrifice Y3 Babamots
Move B1 Bolarus Risa
Move B1 Risa Amoscai
Move B2 Risa Amoscai
Catastrophe Amoscai B
	amoscai: yeah. I did consider that. one or two steps earlier in fact. but I've not played enough to know how to properly counter and I'm kinda not willing enough to devote the time to map out all the possibilities. hence, I'm going to probably see what happens after our planets are connected.
	Babamots: That's fine. I just didn't want you to be blindsided. :-)

21) amoscai: Move G1 Amoscai Babamots

22) Babamots: Trade B2 Y2 Babamots

Build G2 Babamots
Build G3 Amoscai
Catastrophe Babamots Green
	Babamots: You've found a way to make this exciting. :-)

26) Babamots: Discover Y2 Babamots G3 Pakled
	amoscai: I thought about it (:
I still think I have some issues to overcome though

27) amoscai: Trade G1 B1 B3
	Babamots: Oh jeez, I'm in more of a bind than I expected. If I move in now, you move your yellow to my home and double build.

28) Babamots: Build Y1 Pakled

29) amoscai: Build B1 B3

30) Babamots: Discover Y1 Pakled G1 Betazed

32) Babamots: Pass

33) amoscai: Sacrifice G1 B3
Build B2 Babamots
Catastrophe Babamots Blue
	Babamots: Not foreseeing that opportunity you would have had to move in with your yellow and double build has cost me. I wish now I'd kept my mouth shut and just hoped you didn't see it. :-D

	Babamots: Welp, ya got me. Let that be a lesson to both of us about spending too much for only one star. GG.
	amoscai: thanks for all the helpful tips!
