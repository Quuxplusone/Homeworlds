5) dlwillson: T G1 R1 Dlwillson
	Felix: I'm out to prove that I can only win in games that don't really matter ;)
	dlwillson: You very nearly beat me in that game!

6) Felix: T G1 Y1 Felix
	Felix: It was definitely closer than I expected! I thought I was an instant goner after losing the first half of my system. Every game with you has been a nail biter lately :)

7) dlwillson: B G1 Dlwillson
	dlwillson: If I hadn't had the cat y *and* been popping green  battleships at a critical moment, you'd have win. If you hadn't botched the response to my attack, we'd still be in that game.

8) Felix: B Y1 Felix
	Felix: It's true, but you live and you learn! You played extremely well and fended off my attack perfectly. I kept thinking I had all your possible responses covered and you kept surprising me

	Felix: The dance of the yellows...
	dlwillson: I guess I could drive the y1 in, rather than build the y2... No, that's not any better. Hmm...
	dlwillson: Or you could do that, and change the choices... Hm... I think I'm going to have to setup some plastic and have a think. I see lots of bad choices and need to figure out which one is least bad.
	Felix: No problem. Take your time! I'm glad to have created a conundrum for you :) You consistently surprise me with the clever ways you wriggle out of what I think are foolproof traps though.
