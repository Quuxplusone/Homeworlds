	Draw5PlayAll: These games are too predictable at the start. I'm going to try something different this time.
 
As we prepared for our expedition, an announcement from a parallel universe came in. The message, when decrypted, reads:
"Learn your lesson: do not lose control of the traders economy. We failed at this and had to evacuate when an opposing alien race, whose leader was named Felix, destroyed our planet."
 
We're changing the Constellation ship to a trader ship for this reason.

8) Draw5PlayAll: Build B1 Draw5playall

9) Simon: Discover Y1 Simon G3 G3
	Draw5PlayAll: We have taken the risk of creating another Constellation-class trading vessel. We will need to diversify our economy before a disaster happens.

	Simon: wil has called this you-take-one-I-take-three. Nonetheless, a solid opening. gg, always happy to rematch.
	Draw5PlayAll: I could have delayed defeat by moving my guys from LavaFlow into Draw5PlayAll but it was pointless.
 
This is my (I think) 4th 1v1 game I have finished, and my 4th loss.
	Draw5PlayAll: I wonder something.
Suppose we were fighting and you had no other reds, and we kept going back and forth attacking the ships for eternity.
I would likely rule the ship in question destroyed, and force one player to evacuate the star. Or let it be a draw. Of course, this requires both people to not have any better moves.
	Simon: The game lacks a ko rule, you can repeat positions as often as you want. I consider this a hole in the rules. The implementation here doesn't recognize repetition, we'd have to notify an admin.
 
Surprisingly, I haven't had a game with repetition yet. They feel like they come up often, but happen rarely in practice.
 
Teach the game to a friend in real life!
	Draw5PlayAll: Although if both players agreed they had nothing better then they could agree to a draw. It is no different from perpetual check in Earth Chess, except that Earth Chess has rules for that sort of thing.
