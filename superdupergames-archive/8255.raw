Homeworlds Online (SDG# 8255)
Variants: "Hard time"
Started: 2007.6.14, Ended: 2007.9.29
Participants: zoltar (S), jeep (N)
Winner: zoltar

1) jeep: Homeworld Y1 B2 G3
	jeep: Hello again.
	jeep: I prefer going second.  I like being able to react to my opponents opening... esp when my opponent is a stronger player than I am.

2) zoltar: Homeworld B1 R3 G3
	zoltar: h b1 r3 g3

3) jeep: Build G1 Jeep
	zoltar: Hi again!
	jeep: Wow, that opening has taken off like wildfire.
	zoltar: Which opening?  The banker (yours) or mine?  Or using B-R stars?  I still suck at openings, and the good players (TwoShort, Jesse, and Andy Looney) get the advantage early every game before I know what hit me.  The banker opening you are using Andy thinks is strongest, but TwoShort devastates me in the opening every game when I play it.  Unlike with chess, where I have several opening books on my bookshelf, there ain't no book openings or, as the Japenese say, 'joseki' for this game yet.
	jeep: Yours.  I've heard TwoShort say he thought that Traveller was stronger than Banker.

4) zoltar: Build G1 Zoltar

5) jeep: Trade G1 Y1 Jeep

6) zoltar: Build G1 Zoltar
	zoltar: Aha! I just saw a comment of his spying on his game with you. I didn't even know it was called the "Traveler", as I've been calling it "Goldilocks" because it's between the Banker and the Fortress where you are barricaded behind the scarce 1-pip stars.  Well, I'm only using it because TwoShort beats me every time with it; but  then again, he beats me with the Banker every time as well.

	zoltar: Or can you? I'll have to look at this some more...
	zoltar: No, you can't.  If I just move the g3 in, you sac a y2, and move a g1 and y3 into your homeworld and blow up the greens, leaving you with a y3 defending.  But I still can send both the g3 and the g1 in immediately for a bluebird checkmate!
	jeep: Oops.  Thanks for the game.
