Move G1 Alpha Wmreed
	Wheatberry: Huh. Just realized that if I trigger that catastrophe, wmreed would have no way to recover & it'd be game over in a couple turns. This is where the Sinister rules get a bit wacky sometimes; I basically have to defend my enemy just to keep from losing.
	Wheatberry: So let's try this... smilingra, please sacrifice your y1 to move your g1 from alpha to wmreed's homesystem. In exchange, you could capture my g1 in alpha next turn.
	Wheatberry: Otherwise, wyons jumps his R2 from orange to wmreed, builds another red in wmreed next turn, and it's checkmate.
	Wheatberry: Oh, wait a second. wmreed can just trade his r1 for something else on his turn, using his blue star. I am an idiot. Please ignore previous messages. :)

56) smilingra: Attack R1E Alpha
	smilingra: Thanks for the running commentary, Wheatberry. :)

57) wyons: Attack R1E Wmreed

58) wmreed: Build Y1 Wmreed
	wmreed: it doesn't really save me though. He's got me on his next turn. 
	wmreed: unless I'm confused on a rule.  Which I often am. 

59) Wheatberry: Trade G1 R1 Wmreed
	Wheatberry: This should keep things interesting then. If he steals your yellow, steal my green. Sorry wyons. ;)

	wyons: In this situation (with smilingra timing out) surely the move should continue passing clockwise (to me!)- otherwise Wheatberry will get two moves (one after the other).
	wmreed: I agree. 
	smilingra: My deepest apologies.  I thought that I had made my move, but I guess not.   Good luck to you all.
	wyons: Aaron: any chance you can bring smilingra back- that would solve the problem and also save the game from suddenly having a different dynamic?
	smilingra: wyons, you are quite kind.  As long as the others are willing to have me back, I'd gladly hop back in!
	wmreed: i'm willing to allow smilingra to return to play.
	wyons: just up to wheatberry and aaron then?
	wmreed: What's happening with this game?  Anything?

	wyons: Well, nothing at present- but I have been hoping Aaron will be able to fix it when he is back from his travels.
	Wheatberry: This game has sort of slipped off my radar, but I'm willing to hop back into it anytime. And I agree with wyons: we should either (A) have an admin reset smilingra's timer & pass the turn to him, or (B) drop down to a 3-person game & pass the turn to wyons. If smilingra's still around and wants back in, I have no problem doing option A.

	Wheatberry: Hi all! I'm back. I've completely forgetten what my strategy even was in this game, though, so this should be interesting... heh heh
	wyons: sorry guys- that's it. My reading was that Smilingra could not have prevented that attack. But I could be wrong...
