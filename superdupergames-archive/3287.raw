Participants: TwoShort (S), Jesse (N)
Winner: Jesse

1) Jesse: Homeworld R1 B2 G3
Jesse: Ready for another go?

2) TwoShort: Homeworld Y3 B2 G3
TwoShort: Certainly... Red homeworld star? A new theory?

3) Jesse: Build G1 Jesse
Jesse: To me, yes. Andy had some experience with it, and mentioned vaguely that it has some late-game advantages. I'm not sure what he has in mind, but I noticed when Sketchwick tried it against me, it afforded him some extra flexibility in the early and mid game to choose between yellow and green for his capital ship, and it was always a hindrance to mounting an attack. Also, I figured you were much less likely to do in red what you did in blue last time.

4) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort
TwoShort: I've concluded the blue freeze out is the thing to do when the first player uses a blue 1 point star, and a yellow first ship (as Andy always used to); but I don't think it's worth it otherwise. I hadn't thought about the mid-game flexibility oof not having a yellow or green star, but now that you mention it, I can certainly recall being hampered by it.
