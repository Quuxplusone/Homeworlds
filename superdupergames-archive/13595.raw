Laurie_Menke: Hey, Joe... I just realized that I meant to make this an unrated game, but accidentally made it rated. I'm sorry. :o( If you want to play another game (it takes a few to get the hang of it), feel free to challenge me any time, and definitely make it unrated. :o)
Joe: That's no problem :) And I cannot move effectively, as I forgot to include yellow in my starting point :D

19) Laurie_Menke: Build Y2 Laurie_menke
Laurie_Menke: Right. And I took advantage of that and used up all the yellow so it would be hard for you to trade for some. ;o) That's how I learned... just played a few games until I got the hang of what kind of mischief my opponent could cook up. ;o)

Laurie_Menke: Sorry... this game can be brutal sometimes. :o(
Joe: Yes, especially when you start weirdly ;)
Joe: I guess I am done for, as you can bash me with catastrophes on and on (one red and I am dead). Shall we call it quits now, rather than later?

25) Laurie_Menke: Build Y2 Laurie_menke
Laurie_Menke: Sure. You actually did quite well for one of your first games. It took me several games just to understand what to do without having to ask my opponent for help all the time. :o) If you'd like to go again, feel free to challenge me any time. And thanks for the fun! :o)

Joe: Thx for the game also! I will sure come back again ;)
