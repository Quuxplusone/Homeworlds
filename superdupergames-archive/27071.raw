	TeeTeeTee: Going to play this out?
	wil: I am just so far outta your league...  I make wunnerful blunders and you capitalize on them all...
	TeeTeeTee: I'm trying to think where it all went wrong for you, here. As I said earlier, when you built those large yellow ships, you got yourself an immediate material gain, but put yourself in a very weak position: you had no ability to trade ships or put pressure on my ships, and that let me get an effective monopoly on blue.
	wil: I lost way back...early mistake...that move you pointed out was a last ditch effort...
	wil: outgunned and virtual blue factory...its over...time to let someone give you some competition again...
	TeeTeeTee: What do you think the early mistake was? Trading for the r2 in the opening? I think that did let me get a foothold on blues, yes, but going unarmed for so long did put me at risk, and I was fortunate to get away unscathed. Or were you referring to letting me blow up your blue ship?
