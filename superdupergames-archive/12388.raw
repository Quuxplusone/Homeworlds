	TwoShort: So, you did a good job controlling green, to the point I had to bail out of that race and threaten to lock you out of yellow, so now you probably see that it's also essential to diversify into multiple colors early.  That's why I don't usually bother with a yellow star: I'm going to want a yellow ship in the first few turns anyway.  So now I've got more 3 points and most of the yellow, so it's looking bad for you, even if that last move wasn't a critical error :)


24) TwoShort: Sacrifice R2 Twoshort
Attack R3N Agentofchaos
Attack G1N Agentofchaos
	TwoShort: Now might be a good time to mention the "Gun rule": If your opponent draws their gun (takes a red ship), immediately draw your gun.  You can occasionally ignore it for a turn if the opponent can't reach you, but in general, the turn after the other guy first takes a red ship, you need to do the same.

	agentofchaos: Thanks, I'll remember the gun rule.
