36) TwoShort: Attack Y1 Greenville
	zoltar: I survived all that sacrifices stuff and somehow came out of it with a good position, unless I missed your next trick...
	TwoShort: I've thought your position was good throughout. I just didn't say anything because I figured if you wanted to psych yourself out I should let you :)  Of course, that might imply I'm saying so now to psych you out so you'll miss my next trick...  I guess it depends if I come up with one :)
	zoltar: Well, you're the only player that consistently plays moves I didn't anticipate -- usually I figure I know what all the candidate moves are and I'm not surprised. When you play something I didn't even consider, then I'm automatically scared.

	zoltar: That's ok. I've pretty much given up on this one anyway.
	TwoShort: If your pessimism is motivated by a move you see for me, I wish you'd let me know what it is :)  I see a couple ways either of us could launch massive attacks that wouldn't quite be enough for victory and would cripple the attacker.  It seems like there should be a way for one of us to push it over the tipping point, but I don't see it yet. 
	zoltar: I don't see the victory, but I think I'm slowly being squeezed, and now you have a factory and I don't; nor do I have any plan of attack or way to threaten you. I am in the blue economy, but with your factory you can catch up and get most of the remaining pieces, I think. 
	zoltar: I just wish I could see more clearly in a position like this, the way I can in chess, where I know if my opponent's advantage is crushing, or if I have good drawing chances, etc. Here I only am in a fog with a feeling of impending doom at any moment...
	TwoShort: I guess I just want to assure you that I too feel like I'm in a fog of impending doom.  If I set up the position in real pyramids and make the moves I'm considering, I can see if you can crush me in any obvious way the very next turn, but that's about as far as it goes.  
  I'm happy to have the factory, but I can't beat you to the blues, or even get one without giving you the choice of blowing up half my world or taking both b3s.  If I take the red this turn, you catastrophe me and put the g3 you need in the stash so I spend a turn keeping it away from you.  If I take yellow, you can cash Goldilox, which I guess is what I'm leaning toward, but it's not much better than even.
  I don't see how to force catastrophes so I can get more of the pieces after.  So it seems like the game is reaching a stable detente.  Since that never happens, I assume one of us will find the killer move here somewhere, but I don't see it so far.
	zoltar: That makes sense. I created Goldilox as an investment to make sure I could get one of the Y3's as if you get them both I'm in big trouble, and I guess there's no way right now to use your factory in crushing way without my having powerful counter-moves. Making it an interesting game. I think my position has improved over the last few moves, too, and I'm holding my own much better than I usually do in my games with you. And, even given all that, I feel I'm in that fog of impending doom!
