	ts52: I think that's it. You can take one of those, but I've still got an r3 to retake them all.
	wil: Sorry, we don't have dinner enough for all of you.  Yeah, I saw it aftermy move...not before...

	ts52: Nice. Thanks for the game. We should get them to fix that bug.
	wil: All we left you with is that hungry red ship and a world infected with yellow fever, an epidemic soon to be an issue...
	wil: hey...you resigned...not fair...
	ts52: Interesting, just found this in the Homeworlds rules:
Overpopulation and Catastrophes 
If a system contains four or more pieces of the same color (including system markers and ships of any ownership), that system contains an overpopulation of that color. At the end of your turn, you may trigger catastrophes for any overpopulations that exist on the board, regardless of where they are or who owns the ships in them. To trigger a catastrophe, remove all of the pieces of that color from the system (including system markers), and return the pieces to the global stash. If you remove a system marker from a binary system, the system becomes a single-star system. (This may cause the system to become connected to more systems.) If you remove the system marker from a single-star system, the system itself is destroyed, and all of the ships in it are returned to the global stash. Triggering a catastrophe for any given overpopulation is always optional, but if you do choose to trigger it, you must remove all of the pieces causing the overpopulation.
	ts52: Note it specifically mentions catastrophes happening 'at the end of your turn'.
	ts52: I resigned because I thought you should've been able to win with your catastrophes, but apparently that's not the case. Oh well. At least it's not a bug.
