GreedyAlgorithm: Hi, I haven't played a lot, but don't go easy on me. :)

GreedyAlgorithm: First time playing online, though, or any game on SDG, so hopefully there won't be any problems there.
Keith: Then welcome to SDG. Plenty of friendly opponents and a bunch of good games. I recommend checking out the forums and giving Cannon a Castle Danger a try.

Keith: As for this game. Feel free to ask questions. I won't give advice on future moves but I would be happy to explain or give feedback on past moves.

GreedyAlgorithm: Heh, wrong box. :)
Keith: A fairly frequent event during ones first game online. That order box is so far way from the text of your opponents last turn or chat.

Keith: What a yellow denial sequence. Good job.
Keith: I was going to start stocking up on yellow this turn.
GreedyAlgorithm: Thanks. I'm not 100% sure where I'm going with the line, but it was too cute to pass up.

45) GreedyAlgorithm: Sacrifice G1 Extension
Build Y3 Beta
Keith: Oh wow. You have four 3-pointers to my two, I have lost my grip on blue and you still have most of your control over yellow. Good thing for me you havn't played Homeworlds a lot. ;)

46) Keith: Build B1 HornOfPlenty
Catastrophe HornOfPlenty Blue
GreedyAlgorithm: I'd played chess a good bit before, and this strikes me as very similar to amateur-level chess (I mean before you can tell that moving you bishop innocuously move 3 will have such-and-such an impact 10 moves from now). Also I think I've pretty much lost my yellow control based on akai and Alpha, but 4-2 does seem pretty helpful.

47) GreedyAlgorithm: Sacrifice Y2 Beta
Move Y3 Beta Keith
Move B3 Interloper Keith
Keith: I did not think I could get to Extension before you harvested it. Too shy of yellow ships. Better do something about the now five to two 3-pointer situation.
Keith: I did not think I could get to Extension before you harvested it. Too shy of yellow ships. Better do something about the now five to two 3-pointer situation.

Keith: If there is a way out of this it is beyond my ability to see it. Well done. Have you considered joining the Homeworlds ladder? I think you could make a good run at the top rung.
GreedyAlgorithm: Thanks. I just joined! We'll see. :) Good game!
