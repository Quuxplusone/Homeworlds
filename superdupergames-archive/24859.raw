	wil: Thanx for the game!  How did you discover homeworlds?  Do you play the physical game as well?
	foksieloy: Yep, I play the physical game, but most people I played it with (family, friends) either didn't like it, or don't have the time, so I decided to try it online. :) Seems there is much more strategy to this game than I expected (and I expected it to be brutal), so I am hoping to learn a lot here.

	foksieloy: Europe, GMT + 1. :)
 
Well I am new in the game, but as far as I can tell not having access to a ship of certain size+color can seriously limit you later on. Still learning, been reading the wiki, seemed like something I need to avoid.

	foksieloy: I see what you mean now, I have been pondering on my move and noticed a lot of way for you to destroy me quickly. Live and learn, like I said, lack of experience. :)

Catastrophe Wil Red
	foksieloy: You took control over G, I just now noticed how badly it will affect me.
	wil: A monopoly in any ecoomy hurts....I find the moving and trading sectors most worthwhile to corner, but building is valuabe...just having the only factory in the universe can cripple ya.  

	foksieloy: Good game!
	foksieloy: Perhaps another? I really am enjoying this, wish I joined this site sooner. I am having a nice game in paralel with OnePageWars, and I see you are too, perhaps the three of us should  do a multiplayer. :)
	wil: I didn't even see it coming...great move...caught asleep at the wheel...
