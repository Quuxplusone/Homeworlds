zoltar: uh-oh

29) zoltar: Attack G2 Zoltar
Keith: It will give you something to think about. I am sure there are multiple ways out of it.
Keith: I just sent in a move to your move. But by the time I hit send you had undone your move.

30) Keith: Move G1 Bend Zoltar
Catastrophe Zoltar Green
zoltar: oh well, I wanted to change it because my first move didn't work very well. I think I may be in big trouble in any case.

31) zoltar: Trade B1 G1 Zoltar
Keith: With your first move I could have sacrificed my g3, built two g2s in Zoltar and my G3 back in Keith. Boom. Changing your G3 to some other color was the way out I saw.
zoltar: Yes, that's just how I saw it. But I lose anyway, it seems...

zoltar: all I can do.

zoltar: Yup, I think it's just about over -- there goes one star, and there's no way for me to stop it.

43) zoltar: Trade R3 Y3 Zoltar

44) Keith: Discover Y3 Bend G2 Greenway
Keith: It might not be over just yet. You have 7 ships to my 5. We both occupy two sectors and our homeworlds remaing two apart. I do have two large ships to your one.
zoltar: True, but the extra star and extra big ship count for a lot. I'll have to be extra clever or you'll have to be extra clumbsy for me to win.

45) zoltar: Discover G1 Zoltar Y2 Jacket

64) Keith: Move B2 Bend Zoltar

65) zoltar: Sacrifice R1 Wagtail
Attack B2 Zoltar
zoltar: That doesn't work -- you just move your g3 into my homeworld and it's checkmate in two, so I have to rethink this.

Attack B1 Jacket
Attack B2 Jacket

67) zoltar: Sacrifice Y3 Zoltar
Move B1 Zoltar Bend
Move G1 Bend Keith
Move G1 Bend Keith
Catastrophe Keith G
zoltar: Yep -- I'm DOOOOOOOMED

zoltar: Wow. That's a blunder. You have to save your r2, and move your g3 into my homeworld. You forced me to use up all my reds, so I can't capture your g3 and I'm in trouble. but this sack let's me sac your greens.
zoltar: maybe it still works though, I don't know

Keith: If I moved my G3 to your homeworld you grow a green and boom its gone.
Keith: Huh?
zoltar: I did have a defence if you move your g3 in for the kill: I sac my b2 and trade the b1 in jacket for an r1, and the b2 in jacket for a y2. Now I have one less blue ship in my homeworld, so trading your G3 for a B3 doesn't blow it up, and if you sac your red and take out my y3 and one of the other ships, then I sac my newly made y2 in jacket and send in both g1's as I did in our game, so I do have a defence and am threatening to blow up your greens at home as well as capture your g3 in my homeworld. Don't know what you can do next, but it was your only line to pursue.
Keith: Well that is darn dissapointing. A bad end to a bad day for me. Only one actual win so far in a handful of games. I have had enough Homeworlds for a while.
zoltar: That's true, I could just grow a green in my homeworld -- I forgot about that!
zoltar: Sorry to spoil your day. I just had another win against a really good player -- I'm on a roll. We seem to be evenly matched; I hope you don't get discouraged, as you're a really good player, and it's a fun game! Please challenge me as soon as you are rested and ready for another space battle, Keith.
Keith: Homeworld is a good game and we are good at making each other think hard. It is a great comeback victory for you. I will eventually be back.
