Homeworlds Online (SDG# 36144)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2020.3.17, Ended: 2020.3.25
Participants: eliscinsky (S), Babamots (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) Babamots: Homeworld B2 R2 G3 *

2) eliscinsky: Homeworld R1 B3 G3
	Babamots: The rare Gemini option.
	eliscinsky: Gemini ... interesting. But is that merely a deceptive starting position? If I also create a Gemini HW, or combo (S/M or M/L) then we are two steps away (Small Univ).  If I create S/L, then it's a Big Univ.  So all in all not much of a difference in HW choice for me. Or have I missed something?  In the meantime I think I'll stick with a large universe.  Seems I keep missing a critical turning point, and need to learn to recognize it.

3) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots

4) eliscinsky: Build G1 Eliscinsky
	Babamots: I don't mean to be deceptive. Just looking for some variety.
 
And actually, you've given us a microverse: our homeworlds are connected. These games can be quite short.
	eliscinsky: (face-palm) So I did.  Thinking about one thing, and typing another.  LOL ... Game on!

5) Babamots: Trade G1 Y1 Babamots

6) eliscinsky: Trade G1 Y1 Eliscinsky
	eliscinsky: BTW, Are there any write ups on the "best strategies to use" when dealing with the various universes, Large, Small, Micro?  Or is it all just trial by error, I mean by gaining experience.
 
Like when confronted with a large universe you should attempt to do the following ... 1) In The Beginning you should ..., 2) Mid game you should ..., 3) Finally, blah blah ...
 
If playing a Small universe you should start out focusing on ..., then at the end try to position yourself to be able to do ...
 
When if come to a Micro universe these are the things to do, and to watch out for.
 
All this would be helpful to intermediate players to up their game, and a point of reference to beginners during / after their initial games.
 
Hopefully I'll be teaching my wife HW's sometime in the near future and any additional teaching materials would be great.
I have many links to looneylabs.com, ginohn.com, icehousegames.org/wiki, superdupergames.wikidot.com, and of course jpeterbaker.github.io/homeworlds
 
Didn't know if there were any others out there I haven't found.


7) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots
	eliscinsky: Also I truly appreciate your patience in helping me to learn new strategies. :)

8) eliscinsky: Build G1 Eliscinsky
	Babamots: I think of the smaller universes as accelerated versions of the large universe. Like right now, we're already at the stage where we are starting to build up fleets one jump away from one another's homes.

9) Babamots: Trade G1 R1 Babamots
	eliscinsky: Even though we're only 1 hop away, I see that we'll have to discover other stars in order to build up a proper attack vector. Otherwise we'll run the risk of creating a situation in HW for the opponent to attack.  AKA Don't build up to much in HW at any given period.
 
Or am I wrong?
	Babamots: Unless one of us makes a big mistake, we will need other systems for storing ships. Part the winner's invasion will probably be in their homeworld until the winning sequence.
 
I usually plan on needing to control two systems that are one jump away from my opponent. That way, I can threaten catastrophes without being vulnerable to them myself. In this game, my homeworld is one of those two systems. I will almost certainly need an outpost on another medium system.

	Babamots: I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me...
:-P
	eliscinsky: What better way to learn than to imitate a master player.  :D
	Babamots: I've sometimes wondered, how could you exploit it if you knew that your opponent would imitate you as closely as possible (except you'd have to count on them winning if you gave them an opening).

18) eliscinsky: Discover R2 Kronos B3 Regula

Build Y2 Eliscinsky
	eliscinsky: When we're done, you don't have to tell me why you undid that move. I don't understand how I could have taken you.

59) Babamots: Move Y1 Orion Eliscinsky
Catastrophe Eliscinsky Y
	eliscinsky: When we're done, I'd appreciate it if you would tell me why you undid that particular move.

	Babamots: Agreed. Not seeing the bank makes it much harder to analyze archived positions.
	Babamots: I bought a month's worth of CBS so I could watch Discovery and Picard. I just got to where Talos IV is mentioned for the first time, so I get your reference now. :-)
	eliscinsky: Where I get my names for the color of the planets / stars

	eliscinsky: BTW, I've got 3 other games going so I' might be a while before I get back to a game w/ you.
	eliscinsky: And TY again.  If no one is challenging you feel free to hit me up. :)
	Babamots: I'm slightly burned out on HW at the moment. I spent half of last week proofreading drafts of the new Homeworlds rulebook for Pyramid Quartet. I couldn't get the game out of my head all weekend, so I don't mind having a little less HW in my life for a few days. :-D
