1) unic: Homeworld G1 B2 Y3

2) zoltar: Homeworld B3 Y2 G3
unic: Hello - my first game here :) Bear with me if I make bad moves - I just learned this game yesterday.

3) unic: Build Y1 Unic
zoltar: Sure -- I learned in June, lost my first dozen games or so, then got better, and now am near the top, though the top three players can still beat me most of the time. It's really fun, but the sacrifices are the hardest moves to find as well as anticipate, especially yellow sacrifices allowing someone to move more than once and cause a catastrophe with 4 of the same color. I love this game -- it's simple and has chess-like tactics and really makes you think, though it takes a while to get used to it and learn all the basic tactics. Good luck.

unic: Nice maneuver! I shall bear that one in mind :)

14) zoltar: Trade G2 Y2 Harcourt
zoltar: I think you had more of an advantage if you continued to build yellow, as movement is crucial. I have now achieved 'the factory' where I can sacrifice my g3 and then grow it right back with two extra grows, which is a powerful tactical tool. I still need to get into the yellow industry , but now I will have some tricks, because with both your g3 and a green star, if you grow another green (after I trade one of mine for a yellow), I would be able to blow up your greens if I sacrifice my yellow to move a fourth green into your homeworld, so you'll have to look out for that.

15) unic: Build Y3 Unic
zoltar: I think you have the advantage, though, because of your lead in yellow (I'm terrible at openings, even with beginners).

16) zoltar: Trade G3 Y3 Zoltar

17) unic: Sacrifice Y2 Unic
Move Y1 Unic Stella
Move Y1 Stella Harcourt
zoltar: You're playing very well. That last move threatened checkmate (if I ignored the threat, you sac your Y3 and move your G3 all the way from your homeworld to mine, creating a catastrophe that wipes out all my green pieces and wins the game.)

18) zoltar: Trade Y3 R3 Zoltar

19) unic: Build Y2 Unic
zoltar: Excellent move, showing me that my last move was wasted, giving you yet another free move. But I'm not ready to resign yet.

20) zoltar: Trade G2 R2 Harcourt

21) unic: Build Y3 Unic
zoltar: You must be a chess player, as you play much better than I at this game!

22) zoltar: Attack Y1 Harcourt
unic: No, not a chess player. I used to play Othello competitively a few years back though... and play all sorts of abstract games just for fun. Traditional western chess has never caught my fancy however.

25) unic: Trade Y3 G3 Unic
zoltar: I played chess first, then switched to the Japanese varient Shogi, which I liked even better; then when planning on teaching chess to my cousins (age ranging 4-12), I looked for simpler abstract games to start them with, and discovered a world of wonderful games I never knew existed. Then, to my even greater suprise, the author of several of the games I subsequently purchased lived in my neighborhood! I met Andy Looney (creator of the IceHouse pieces) and the gaming author of homeworlds, John Cooper, who both live a mile from me in either direction! John Cooper gave me some games, such as "Lost Cities", one of his favorites -- he likes the author Reiner Knizia, and at his house I've played other great Knizia games, such as Ra, John's favorite. John told me next time I visit, he is going to teach me another of his favorites: Lord of the Rings - The Confrontation. I love having a rocket scientist and game author neighbor who has such fun games that I've never heard of.

zoltar: Since then, I've gotten a couple dozen games, (I buy them used on eBay, then resell ones neither I nor my cousins find really fun). Our favorites: Flux and SET card games (set is amazing for young kids, as a sharp 6 year old cousin can beat me, and that wouldn't happen with, say, chess); Blokus (a rare 4-player game without randomizers or hidden information that actually works and is pretty), Cathedral (beautiful wooden pieces), Quarto and then the even better Quoridor from Gigamic (I bought a bunch of games from that company, Gigamic); Gobblet (another tic-tac-toe improvement like Quarto, but you can make your own set with IceHouse pieces); Ticket to Ride (a fun game that is a favorite with the 6 and 10 year old cousins, but for adults the similar but more complicated Thurn and Taxis is nicer); 10 Days in the USA/Africa/Europe -- all three are the same except for the names of pieces (states or countries), but thanks to this game, which has nice strategy as well, my 6-year-old cousin knows every state in the USA and where every country is in Europe of Africa!

zoltar: Andy Looney directed me to this site in June, when I learned John Cooper's game Homeworlds that we are playing. I just last week learned another IceHouse game, Pikemen, which is authored by another game author (a Bridge Master turned game author) that I know and play games with on Thursday's at LooneyLabs' game night. All my chess skills seem to help, as I've won my first three games (against other beginners). I want to learn more IceHouse games, as I love the shape and feel of the pyramids, and I'm trying another one online here, Martian Chess, and just started my first game of it.

zoltar: That's the extent of my gaming experience. And as a rather new abstract gamer (except for chess) who has suddenly fallen into a new world of gaming, especially when I get to play with game authors and even beta-test games every week, I'm always open to know the top picks of another gamer. While the best Homeworlds players (Andy Looney and Jesse) can beat me almost every game, you're the first beginner that is trouncing me, as I usually mop up on all the other beginners and advanced beginners. That tells me you are an experienced abstract gamer (hence I wondered if you were a chess master). I'm impressed. So I'd be happy to have any recommendations from you on games that I haven't heard of but which are like the ones I've mentioned that I have played and liked. My only constraint is money - I like to buy them used and cheap on eBay rather than say, import them new from Germany.

26) zoltar: Trade G2 Y2 Harcourt
unic: Wow, that was a long message! :)

unic: Knizia is my favourite designer for german-style games. He's also made several "abstracts" - games that have no luck or hidden information and work well on two.

unic: Game recommendations - I'll have a ponder. I've made a list with a bit over 200 abstracts one can improvize pieces for (well, or steal pieces from various games in my collection) which my wife and I are gradually trying out to see which ones we like.

unic: Gigamic does make nice games - though often with a tendency towards short and rather tactical ones. Cathedral is one of their better, I think... I'm not keen on Quarto.

unic: If you like Blokus, have you tried Blokus Trigon? Me and the wife both prefer that to standard Blokus... the pieces are all shapes made out of up to 6 triangles.

unic: Well, I'll have a ponder on what to recommend.

27) unic: Discover G3 Unic B3 Astra
zoltar: I have lots of Gigamic games: Cathedral is fun and the prettiest, but the first player has an advantage (good for playing with kids) and I'm experimenting by having the first player not allowed to start with a big piece; Quarto is short and purely tactical, so it's a great tactics-trainer for young kids with a short attention span who won't focus for an entire game of chess, but I don't play it with adults; Quoridor is short and tactical, but much more fun with adults as well, and interesting ideas emerge, as with this game Homeworlds; Batik is pretty and fun for 4 year olds and up and kids too lazy or unwilling to do the thinking in tactical games.

zoltar: Knizia seems to be a favorite among game designers I've met, who all seem to favor the recent surge in German games.

zoltar: And I've been waiting to pounce on a cheap half-priced Blokus Trigon as soon as some boring person gets it for a present, doesn't like it, and sells it on eBay, but I might just buy it outright for a cousin for Christmas if I can't find it by then -- I've seen the reviews for it and it looks great.

zoltar: I have a game with 6-sided pieces from Australia called Tantrix that I haven't played but which looks cool, and a Thailand game called Fire and Ice that I've played twice, which is mostly tactical but was really fun.

28) zoltar: Build G2 Harcourt
unic: I'm in the camp that isn't convinced about the first-player advantage in Cathedral. But if the advantage is real, playing pairs of games and counting points work to even things out.

unic: Have you tried Quads from Gigamic?
zoltar: Yes, I have Quads as well and played it once and remember liking it but haven't got back to it yet. I also have Quivive, Quits, Pyraos, and Bataclan from Gigamic. I discoved Gigamic first with Quoridor and Quarto, and so I grabbed a bunch of their games before I found most of the others.

39) unic: Build Y1 Unic
zoltar: I think you're moving your G3 out was a big mistake btw. First, it let me blow up both your g3's (I'm not sure if you saw that I could do that), and second, it's dangerous to leave your homeworld without a 3-sized piece. Because you had a big lead, and have successfully controlled most of the yellow technology, you're still in very good shape, and your Y3 can always come back to defend your homeworld. But your lead was much greater before, and now I have a lot more chances.

40) zoltar: Move G2 Banana Unic
unic: You might be right. I did see that you could blow up my green ships - but this leaves you without any yellow ships at all. At the time, I thought it was worth it.

41) unic: Trade Y1 R1 Unic

zoltar: Your play is outstanding at the beginning -- and you had a clearly winning position -- probably from your general gaming experience and intuitions. The middle and endgame of homeworlds is very tricky though, and you probably need several games to grasp the various themes and tactics.

zoltar: There are two very important middle-game rules. The first good general principle to never leave your homeworld without a 3-pip piece (unless you are forcing checkmate or a material gain that gives your opponent no chance at counter-attacking). The second principle is to always get a 'gun' (a red ship) as soon as your opponent does. It can be an R1 anywhere, as that way you can sacrifice it for a capture if an enemy piece moves in to bully you. Note that if any of your y1 pieces were instead a r1 piece, you could now simply sacrifice the r1 from anywhere on the board and capture my g2. So I could not have made this devastating move. Instead, I'm threatening to capture all of your homeworld pieces at once by sacking my R3 for three attacks, and you can't even bring back your Y3 in defence, as being the 4th yellow in the system, a catastrophe would follow and eliminate all of your ships. Your only move in retrospect was to trade a Y2 for an R2 in your homeworld.
zoltar: You played better than any other first time player I've encountered! I hope you like the game and want to play more. Thanks.
unic: Nicely done - I didn't bear in mind that sacrificing a ship would give you the power to use that colour in any system.

unic: Another game? I liked this and sure want to play more!
