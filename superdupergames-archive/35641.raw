	capi3101: Damn. Touch√©.
	Trydnt: Yeah there was no way you could keep that big green unfortunately. made sure of that or else I wouldn't have left it in the bank
	capi3101: Wait, what the hell just happened?!?!
	Trydnt: bluebird
	Trydnt: I sacrificed my y3 to move my g3 from my homeworld all the way across the universe to yours and annihilated the three green ships you had there. If there are no ships left at your homeworld you lose. If I hadn't had that r1 ship in my homeworld I wouldn't have been able to do it either as that would have left me with no ships at mine. But since you had too many green ships already in every other place, Sugit was the only place it could go without being a danger to you. You couldn't move it since you didn't have yellow, so nowhere to safely grow it and no way to run away means I can be sure I can capture it on the next turn
	Trydnt: always be aware of how much yellow your opponent has as that will determine how far they can jump. for example, getting a y2 ship in the early-mid game and a few ships one step from your star means you can jump them straight to your opponent's homeworld and blow up a color if they ever grow three of those there
