Homeworlds Online (SDG# 26105)
Variants: "Hard time"
Started: 2014.8.15, Ended: 2014.9.13
Participants: peterh58 (S), wil (N)
Winner: wil

1) wil: Homeworld B3 Y1 G3
	peterh58: homeworld G1 B2 R3

2) peterh58: Homeworld G1 B2 R3
	wil: you can make your move now...do you play the physical game with pyramids?

	wil: thank you for the game!!
	peterh58: homeworld G1 B2 R3

3) wil: Build G1 Wil
	peterh58: Oops, I see now.

	peterh58: I've played a couple of times with my pyramids, but find it difficult to persuade people to play. I think it's a very cool game though.


4) peterh58: Build R1 Peterh58
	wil: Chess players are the best...they already have the mindset for this kind of game... and I like it better....
	wil: You switched from fortress to banker I see...

5) wil: Build G1 Wil
	peterh58: Fortress to banker? Not familiar with the jargon... I'm clearly doomed already  :)


6) peterh58: Trade R1 Y1 Peterh58
	wil: Well not doomed but you did provide me the early advantage.  
	wil: the starting HWs  Banker 2/1 stars in homeworld allowing you to build 'investments' of 3 pip stars which by sacrificing green ships can become your own later in the game...    Fortress is 3/2 pip homeworld because 1 pips often get used up in the game if played correctly you've got a 1 pip mote that is hard to penetrate.  Mine 3/1 hw, is goldilocks...no strategy...just not big, not small for first stars to access...  
	peterh58: Flip. There's clearly a lot to think about! I must have a hunt round for strategy articles...


7) wil: Discover G1 Wil B2 B2

8) peterh58: Build Y1 Peterh58
	wil: where abouts you from? how did you find the pyramids?

	peterh58: I'm in Oxford UK. I bought Zendo many years ago from my FLGS. I love the "open source" nature of the pyramid games.

15) wil: Trade G2 R2 B2
	wil: That is called a factory....any time you have a large G3 and another green you've built yourself a factory....the factory doesn't go into operation though until you can sac your G3 to build 3 and actually get a 3 back...(so the bank has to be out of green or low on green.)
