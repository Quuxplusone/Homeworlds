MikeYarrum: I'm beginning to think we shouldn't play each other anymore - you're too good!
zoltar: Yeah, I avoid TwoShort for the same reason. We learn the most when we lose, but several losses in a row isn't very fun -- I know that feeling well, so maybe you should continue to play me, but only a small percentage, and try to find others of differing strengths as well to balance things out.
MikeYarrum: Sometimes I make a major mistake like this one, and I feel like scrapping the game. That doesn't bother you, does it? (I'm trying to be neither a quitter nor a sore loser here.)
zoltar: No, not at all. No need wasting time in a losing position, unless you think there is something to be learned about the endgame in some cases.
zoltar: But you do seem to be winning in the multi-player game: as long as you can keep Jesse and me weak fighting each other, you have the best chance at winning.
MikeYarrum: Thanks! It will be interesting to see how that game turns out...
