Winner: zoltar

1) Leonard_Daniels: Homeworld Y1 B2 G3

2) wil: Homeworld R3 B1 G3
	Leonard_Daniels: Good luck everyone.

3) zoltar: Homeworld B3 R2 G3

4) OnePageWars: Homeworld G3 B2 Y3
	zoltar: Heghlu'meH QaQ jajvam!
	Leonard_Daniels: It doesn't bode well that I've been outgeeked this early in the game.
	OnePageWars: what does "Heghlu'meH QaQ jajvam!" mean?
	OnePageWars: zoltar, will you enter into alliance with me? I wish to avoid early confronataion.

5) Leonard_Daniels: Build G1 Leonard_daniels
	wil: An alliance???  LD...should if I sacrifice to take out OPWs drone star you'll have a direct line into his world...  
 
Has this newbie got protocol correct?
	wil: Should only three player games be played to eliminate this issue?
	OnePageWars: The peaceful planet of Ailaria stands by it's offer. We await you response.
	OnePageWars: (OOC: I just now named my planet, if you didn't catch it)
	OnePageWars: (OOC: http://rinkworks.com/namegen )
	zoltar: Right now, so far, I consider myself to be at peace with everyone. If one player gets too strong I can help out, but for now, Zoltar plans to peacefully develop the Zoltarian Empire.
 
And "Heghlu'meH QaQ jajvam!" means "Today is a good day to die" in Klingon. Has not your civilization developed 'Google', yet you have mastered interstellar flight? Intriguing.
	zoltar: Right now, so far, I consider myself to be at peace with everyone. If one player gets too strong I can help out, but for now, Zoltar plans to peacefully develop the Zoltarian Empire.

	zoltar: Ah, now I see: OnePageWarse, you and I both have gateways to the small star systems. Yes, I don't plan on attacking my closer neighbor right away, if that's what you mean, though I don't want to gang up on anyone either. In the 4-player game (at least) 2 players must share the same size double star and so are closer to each other. It has not been a problem in previous 4-player games, because of the extra pyramids in the bank to choose from in the four-player game.
	wil: Nice zoltar chastising our computer translation ability whilst double posting....
	OnePageWars: The proud Ailarians will not stoop to gleaning information from an invasive Google. We shall continue to prosper as our ancestors have before us.
	OnePageWars: Honorable Zoltarians.
Our culture highly values such objective views of things.
Sincerely, The Council of Foreign Relations.
	zoltar: Nice Zoltar did not double post: Zoltar'z tranzmizzion was bifurcated by a wormhole and echoed twice by server.
	Leonard_Daniels: Like Zoltar, I intend to consider myself at peace, and not gang up on anyone.  I'm new to the game, so I would probably be a liability anyway.

6) wil: Build G1 Wil

7) zoltar: Build G1 Zoltar
	wil: Shouldn't the program actually start with everyone having one large ship and one small ship of the same color???  I mean what else are you gonna do?  Trade your ship in for another color first turn?

13) Leonard_Daniels: Build G1 Leonard_daniels
	OnePageWars: Ailaria contines it's production of mobile ships.
	OnePageWars: A strange transmission has been intercepted by an Ailarian: http://www.twitch.tv/riotgames
 
Ailarian intelligence is working on decoding the significance of this broadcast. In keeping with our belief in freedom of information, we will keep you updated on the decoding process.

14) wil: Trade G1 Y1 Wil
	Leonard_Daniels: Leonardian scientists detect signals emanating from foreign systems.  They prepare craft for first contact.
	OnePageWars: Their are two schools of thought developing within the Ailarian people. Some think that there is some code hidden withing the broadcast. Others think it is simply a sports broadcast, or something comparable. This dissent remains to be resolved.

15) zoltar: Build Y2 Zoltar
	wil: the eastern lemurians have discovered propulsion...

16) OnePageWars: Trade Y1 R1 Onepagewars
	OnePageWars: The Ailarians, due to a strong belief in self defense have crowdfunded the overhaul of a transport ship into a gunship.

17) Leonard_Daniels: Trade G1 R1 Leonard_daniels
	Leonard_Daniels: The Leonardian fleet suddenly looks a little defenceless.

18) wil: Trade G1 R1 Wil

19) zoltar: Trade Y1 R1 Zoltar
	wil: um..er...so much for all that peaceful talk...
	zoltar: What a bunch of war mongers. Now you've forced me to get a gun too, when I was ready to go blue!

20) OnePageWars: Trade Y1 B1 Onepagewars
	OnePageWars: Due to the recent articles in major news outlets written by prominent Ailarian statisticians public opinion on the strange broadcast has experienced a significant shift.
 
Popular opinion now holds that the broadcast is in fact a sports game. The nature of said game is still under debate, but those who insist it contains a secret message are dwindling by the minute.
	OnePageWars: Despite the recent hype regarding the transmission, the Ailarian Council of Foreign Relations is currently focusing on a more pressing issue.
 
Rumors have been circulating of a supposed surprise attack by the Ailarian troops. The council is working on a plan to dispel such superfluous rumors.

26) wil: Trade G1 B1 Wil

27) zoltar: Build Y1 Zoltar
	wil: The east coast has now accumulated acess to resources of all varieties....as he looks furtively through space and future possibilities.

30) wil: Build G1 Wil

31) zoltar: Trade G1 B1 Zoltar
	wil: wondering how exactly this coast and that got a step behind the hordes of the poles....

32) OnePageWars: Build B2 Onepagewars
	Leonard_Daniels: Looks about equal to me - everybody has four small ships plus their original ship, apart from West, who have a turn in hand anyway.  What makes you say you're behind?
	zoltar: I'd say North has the lead, simply from having the factory setup. East I'd say is next. South and West share the same-sized outlet to the outside, and our both having the fortress setup with only 4 smalls in the bank makes it difficult for us to expand, giving us by far the worse positions.
	zoltar: I mean to say North probably has the lead from the banker setup, and with the medium pieces coming out next, soon North can sit on some large stars and then cash them in.

33) Leonard_Daniels: Discover B1 Leonard_daniels G3 Heworth
	OnePageWars: What's around the river bend?
 
(OOC: Quoted from Disney's Pocahontas.)

34) wil: Build B2 Wil

35) zoltar: Discover B1 Zoltar G1 Greenpea

36) OnePageWars: Discover B1 Onepagewars G1 Kolorvar
	zoltar: Zoltar considered the destruction of the Y2 drone to propel the b1 scout on a suicide mission into the Ailarian Homeworld where it would supernova the blue twin star; but the Zoltarian Senate overruled the action and instead legislated that establishing a peaceful outpost on a key moon would be more in line with the goals of the Zoltarian space exploration program.
	wil: hmmm in comparision to previous comments....my only comment can be.....er...yeah right.
	zoltar: The Zoltarian fllet is also now in position to destroy have of the Wil homeworld with a similar Y2 sacrifice. In a 2-Empire galaxy, that would be an obvious tactical ploy. But in a 4-Empire galaxy, and this early, the Zoltarian ruling counsel deems it unwise to weaken oneself so early in the game just to also weaken one of three other empires more. Such tactics appear to be poor long-term strategy. 
	wil: So I see....the peace loving Zoltarians as described earlier in this discussion are only peace loving until the time comes where they can clearly dominate...and then they will gladly take up the mantle of conquereror....

37) Leonard_Daniels: Build B2 Heworth
	OnePageWars: The fertile planet of Kolorvar has been discovered by an Ailarian trade vessel. It appears to be uninhabited, but time will tell.
	Leonard_Daniels: [One of my messages from earlier appears to have been deleted - was it because I made reference to specific moves that a specific player could make?  If so, who deleted my message?]

38) wil: Discover B2 Wil G2 Fortcourage
	zoltar: Zoltarians love peace. Zoltarians will abide by the will of the gods, who have stated in the prophecies that the Zoltarians have been chosen by the gods to rule the universe. The Zoltarians only follow the will of the gods, nothing more, nothing less.
	zoltar: The Zoltarians know of no method that anyone can delete any messages, even one's own. The answer is that no mortal deleted your message, that it was what is known as a 'computer glitch' or perhaps it is the will of the gods, whose methods are beyond the understandings of all mortals.

39) zoltar: Build B3 Greenpea
	wil: F troop is establishing a trading post.

40) OnePageWars: Build B3 Kolorvar

	Leonard_Daniels: Leonardian settlers have installed a stargate in the Heworth system, in an attempt to attract interstellar trade.

44) OnePageWars: Trade B3 Y3 Kolorvar

45) Leonard_Daniels: Discover G1 Leonard_daniels Y3 Clifton
	OnePageWars: The freighter receives an overhaul with most of the cargo hold being occupied by thrusters.

46) wil: Build G2 Wil

47) zoltar: Build G2 Zoltar
	Leonard_Daniels: Leonardian explorers have discovered a new star system rich in fuel deposits.  They get to work on finding a way to exploit it.

48) zoltar: Build Y2 Greenpea
	wil: meanwhile a civilization that has never seen so many ships and so many stars so close is absolutely clueless about what to do....so will make eggplant parmesan, spaghetti squash and some sourdough garlic bread...

68) wil: Discover B1 Fortcourage R3 Whynot

	Leonard_Daniels: ...at the cost of the lives of the several hundred Leonardian citizens who made up the crew of the starship destroyed by the Zoltarian weapon of mass destruction.  The Leonardian homeworld enters a period of mourning, and its leaders vow to never forget this atrocity.

	Leonard_Daniels: The major star of the Leonardian system, Leonard Alpha, is destroyed.  Billions are dead.  The few survivors board colony ships and flee the sector, abandoning their existing facilities and ships.  The Leonardian military have just enough time to launch a suicide attack against the Zoltarian shipyards.  Despite their bitterness against the residents of the Wil system for their betrayal, the Leonardian strategists recognise that the sector will be safer in their hands than in the hands of the bloodthirsty Zoltarian horde.

	wil: love how those peaceful zoltarians speak with forked tongue, takeover and capitalize on others invesstments and star system buildig rather than build their own....nothing but vulture capitalists and parasites....

	wil: how did you take green pea back, whenI had both?

	zoltar: Yes, that doesn't make sense. Looking back, there was some sort of glitch, I think. The game log below says:
 
East's R1 ship was overtaken by East. 
 
But it should have said "South's R1 ship". I don't understand it. When I looked at the game, I still saw a R1 of mine in the system. Or maybe my R1 ship has acquired a new secret tech and not reported it. Oh well.
	wil: Yeah,....i was just completely overpowered....aint like those two little guyss would have made much difference....just prolonged the agony
	zoltar: If you'd seen the glitch, I'd have passed so you could redo your move. But yeah, it was prolonging the inevitable. I would have sent a non-red 2-pip ship to that star and then taken them both by sacking an R2 or R3 somewhere else -- as long as I don't let you start building red or blue at small stars, I'm safe and have a pretty easy victory. I made some sacrifices just to make my homeworld maximally safe and minimize counterplay at that point. Leonard could have kept playing, though, and had a chance if I was weakened taking you out. The 3 and 4-p games can be interesting like that: if you're weak you can sit back and try to fortify your position and let the others fight.
	wil: Yes I thiink i have an interest in 3 player games, not much in four...I don't like the siamese homeworld issue
	zoltar: Right. I haven't played a multi-player homeworlds game in years, and I'd forgotten that because there are only 3 distinct star formations, a four-player game forces a conflict between two players. 3 is better, then.
