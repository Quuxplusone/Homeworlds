i'm still having trouble visualizing with the arrangement of the board. i tend not to make mistakes when i take the time to set up the game with real icehouse pieces.

	face: still not certain how i recovered from that early mistake. very well played.
	ZackStack: Well played indeed.  You were able to get a new large ship built and back to your homeworld very quickly while I simply tried to recover the ships I had burnt to blow up your first one...  Then you did a much better job building a large fleet of large ships!  Very good game!
