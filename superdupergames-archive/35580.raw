3) Dther: Build G1 Dther

4) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots

5) Dther: Trade G1 R1 Dther

6) Babamots: Trade G1 R1 Babamots

7) Dther: Build R2 Dther

8) Babamots: Build R2 Babamots

9) Dther: Trade R1 Y1 Dther

10) Babamots: Trade R2 Y2 Babamots

11) Dther: Build Y1 Dther
	Babamots: Everything's going pretty standard so far. I'm planning to give more commentary when things liven up.
 
It's pretty common for the player going second to essentially mirror what the other player does for a while. It can be a little dull, but it's often the best option for South.

12) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots
	Dther: Sorry about the long move, been really busy in real life.

13) Dther: Build G1 Dther
	Babamots: No problem.

14) Babamots: Discover G1 Babamots B1 Andoria

15) Dther: Discover G1 Dther Y3 Theseus

16) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots

17) Dther: Discover Y1 Dther G3 Yggdrasil
	Babamots: Right now I think you should continue to fight me for control of green. It's common for fights like this to end with all pieces of the contested color being turned into systems or ships. The final build is likely to involve a sacrifice of the g3, so expect me try to build the last TWO green ships in one move (and rebuild the sacrificed g3).
 
Later on, it may be important that you have the advantage in yellow ship count (and you have a yellow "investment"). You will probably want to spread out your yellows and then build more yellow soon.

18) Babamots: Move Y2 Babamots Andoria

19) Dther: Build G2 Dther

20) Babamots: Sacrifice G3 Babamots
Build G2 Andoria
Build G2 Babamots
Build G3 Babamots

21) Dther: Build Y1 Yggdrasil
	Babamots: We both have "factories," so between the two of us, we will probably build most of the pieces pretty soon.

22) Babamots: Sacrifice G3 Babamots
Build R1 Babamots
Build R2 Babamots
Build G3 Babamots
	Babamots: Do you know what I mean by "factory?" The green supply is gone and you have a large green in the same system as another green. You can sacrifice the g3 to build two ships and rebuild your g3, basically getting a free build move.

23) Dther: Sacrifice G3 Dther
Build Y2 Dther
Build Y3 Dther
Build G3 Dther

24) Babamots: Build Y3 Andoria
	Dther: I do- I wanted to get rid of the small yellows so that I could build the bigger ships. I didn't want to build other colours yet because I was afraid of a catastrophe, but in retrospect I probably could have gotten away with some reds.

25) Dther: Sacrifice Y2 Dther
Move G1 Theseus Andoria
Move G1 Andoria Babamots
Catastrophe Babamots G

26) Babamots: Trade R1 G1 Babamots
	Babamots: Ah, very good. I wasn't very careful there.

27) Dther: Sacrifice G2 Dther
Build Y2 Yggdrasil
Build Y3 Dther
	Babamots: So rather than re-defending with my large ship, I've traded to match the color of the only large that you could get to my home (the green). If you sacrificed your y3 to move your g3 to my home immediately, I could double build to catastrophe it away.
 
If you build yellow, I'm in huge trouble.
	Babamots: Your best move is probably to sacrifice g2 to build y2 and y3 in Yggdrasil and Dther respectively. I can't cause a catastrophe without almost certainly losing in a move or two, and you'll be ahead by two large ships.
 
Well done :-D

28) Babamots: Move Y3 Andoria Babamots
	Dther: I'm really impressed by the kind of tactical depth that this game has. I'm wondering if there could be something like Chess problems, where players are given a board state and need to find the ideal series of moves to create a major advantage.

29) Dther: Discover Y1 Yggdrasil B1 Rubicon
	Babamots: I tried to compose some Homeworlds puzzles once, but I thought it was quite difficult to come up with situations where I could say with certainty what the best move was unless it was obviously best.

30) Babamots: Move R2 Babamots Rubicon

31) Dther: Sacrifice Y3 Dther
Move Y1 Rubicon Babamots
Move Y1 Yggdrasil Andoria
Move Y1 Andoria Babamots
Catastrophe Babamots Y

32) Babamots: Sacrifice Y2 Andoria
Move R1 Babamots Dther
Discover R2 Rubicon Y3 Pakeld
	Babamots: Very good, and it looks like you're holding your own in your game with dragon76n, too. You don't need my advice as much as I expected. It's hard to feel like the old pro giving a lesson when I actually lose. Just goes to show how quickly a game will get away from you if you're not careful. My only excuse is that I'm pretty focused on beating Felix in the tournament :-).

33) Dther: Sacrifice R2 Dther
Attack R1 Dther
Pass
	Babamots: Here's one last puzzle for you: see if you can prevent me from causing a red catastrophe in your home. Not knowing this trick cost me a high-stakes game once (to Felix, as it happens).

34) Babamots: Trade G2 Y2 Andoria
	Babamots: Good! I wondered if you would get that.
	Dther: Seemed like this was the only way. I thought about moving it away, but then I realised that you could just sacrifice the G2 in Andoria to build two more reds and cause a catastrophe. I'm wondering whether moving the Y3 into Babamots would have been a more optimal move, since even if you caused a red catastrophe in my system, I could trade it for a blue and sacrifice my G3 to completely destroy Babamots.
 
Thanks for all the advice, by the way. I've learnt a great deal from just these two games :)
	Dther: You know, on the topic of Homeworlds problems, I've recently thought about how Lichess gets its large pool of chess problems by pulling them out of turning points in high level games. Maybe when I have time, I might comb the database for interesting games. Even if the answers ended up feeling "obvious", it might be a fun showcase of the complexity that can arise from Homeworlds' fairly simple rules set.
 
I'm also wondering about the ways to "evaluate" board state in the same way it's done by Chess AIs. That would probably be a huge step in developing an AI for Homeworlds.
	Babamots: By my count, responding to my "threat" (and puzzle challenge) has set you back by one move compared to just ignoring my pesky red and proceeding like you outlined. I hope it was worth your time to make sure sacrifice-red-to-attack-red-while-avoiding-catastrophe is in your bag of tools.

35) Dther: Move Y3 Dther Babamots

36) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots

37) Dther: Trade Y3 B3 Babamots

38) Babamots: Move R2 Pakeld Dther

39) Dther: Sacrifice G3 Dther
Build B1 Babamots
Build B1 Babamots
Build R1 Dther
Catastrophe Babamots B
	Babamots: GG WP! I'll have to be on my toes the next time we play.
 
I like the idea of collecting turning points of high-level games. That would be easier than composing our own puzzles anyway. The SDG archive has many many games. I've always heard that TwoShort and TeeTeeTee were extremely good, but they retired before I showed up. I oughta study them.
 

	Dther: Gg! Sort of a pyhrric victory in that your rogue red ship can just sweep up my homeworld ;)
	Draw5PlayAll: You could have just taken it out with a catastrophe.
