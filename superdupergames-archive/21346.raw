	mneme: Dissapointing end; I'd hoped you'd seen that issue.  Thanks for the game!
	mneme: FWIW, I'd actually had a mate threat even if your system had non-blue ships in it.  If you ever got to 3 blue in your home (without red in your universe), my plan was to sac my y3 to blow up blue in your home system, then stick my small yellow ship in your home and pop my g2 to finish the job.
