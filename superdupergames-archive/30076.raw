	Draw5PlayAll: Homeworld Stability is quite useful!!

	foksieloy: I usually play quite aggressive, so I always look for opportunities to sacrifice y2 and catastrophe a system with 2 in it.
	Draw5PlayAll: Weird, SDG did not stop me from losing.
	foksieloy: I am quite sure it used to. Also, the y1 sacrifice you did used to be illegal, you can't leave your home system empty even during turn. Are they programming a new version?
 
Anyway, I was 3 turns from winning. Move b3 to your system, trade to r3, win.
	Draw5PlayAll: You did not even really need to trade, as sacrificing an R2@Tibbers would have been sufficient no matter what I did.
 
The homeworlds rules at http://www.looneylabs.com/rules/homeworlds say:
"Game Over: It's OK to temporarily abandon your Homeworld as long as you have a ship there again by the time your turn is over. However, you are eliminated from the game if both stars in your Homeworld are destroyed, or if none of the ships at your Homeworld are yours."
 
I interpreted the homeworlds as having "stability", so that instead of collapsing immediately, they take time to deteriorate, which can be stopped if you can get a ship there.
	foksieloy: Ok, I was wrong about the ships at homeworld rule it seems. Anyway, Good game! If you want a rematch, or a non ranked game, just send me a shout.
