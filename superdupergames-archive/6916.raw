	Lexicon: I honestly would have resigned like ten moves ago (whenever you hoarded the yellows), but tournament etiquette suggests I shouldn't I suppose and hey, maybe you'll screw up. :)
	jeep: I won't be offended if you resign.  But yeah, I might screw up...

	Lexicon: meh.  I doubt this is much fun for either of us.  I have been trounced.  Good game! :)
	jeep: Yeah, not really, but I think I had it in hand.  I think I could have won it faster, but I was paranoid I'd screw up.
	Lexicon: Better safe than sorry for the tournament.  :)
