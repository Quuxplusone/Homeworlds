Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2018.12.6, Ended: 2018.12.8
Participants: Trydnt (S), phi_618 (N)
Winner: Trydnt

1) phi_618: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3

2) Trydnt: Homeworld G3 B1 B3 *
	phi_618: Good luck and have fun, again. :)

3) phi_618: Build G1 Phi_618
	Trydnt: today's lesson, why you never take a b1 in your homeworld if you are going first
	phi_618: And the same would be said for a g1, but a y1 or r1 would have been fine?

4) Trydnt: Build B1 Trydnt
	Trydnt: Yes. You start with three pieces. Two of those have to be blue and green then red or yellow for the third. If you take a blue or a green 1 first then your opponent can take the same and that color as a large ship with the remaining color in the other half of their star

5) phi_618: Trade G3 B3 Phi_618
	phi_618: So Proverb 1: If your opponent builds a small of a color you do not yet have, do likewise.
Proverb 2: Playing second, follow in the footsteps of the first player until a clearer path emerges.
Proverb 3: Avoid a b1 or g1 Homeworld if playing first.

6) Trydnt: Trade B3 Y3 Trydnt
	phi_618: I guess this isn't as bad as last time. This time it's just like I passed my turn, instead of being completely locked out of a color.
	phi_618: not a good time to be down a tempo, though, the more I think about the situation.
