Homeworlds Online (SDG# 20402)
Variants: "Hard time"
Started: 2011.7.20, Ended: 2011.7.27
Participants: ajo (S), SilentTitan (N)
Winner: SilentTitan

1) SilentTitan: Homeworld R1 B2 G3

2) ajo: Homeworld G3 Y2 R3 *
	ajo: Let's see if this opening works...

3) SilentTitan: Build G1 Silenttitan
	SilentTitan: Looks good

4) ajo: Build R1 Ajo

5) SilentTitan: Trade G3 R3 Silenttitan

6) ajo: Discover R1 Ajo B1 Alpha

7) SilentTitan: Build G1 Silenttitan
	ajo: Well, we've diverged from my predicted main variation already. So it's not working as well as I planned...

8) ajo: Trade R1 G1 Alpha
	SilentTitan: lol.... battle plan never survives meeting the enemy.

9) SilentTitan: Trade G1 Y1 Silenttitan

10) ajo: Build R1 Ajo

11) SilentTitan: Build Y1 Silenttitan

12) ajo: Move R1 Ajo Alpha

13) SilentTitan: Build Y1 Silenttitan

14) ajo: Build G1 Alpha
	ajo: BTW, here's how I *expected* the opening to go:
(ST) build g1
(AJO) build r1
(ST) trade g3 y3
(AJO) discover r1 ajo r1 Junk
(ST) build g1
(AJO) build r2 ajo

15) SilentTitan: Discover Y1 Silenttitan G3 Sky

16) ajo: Build G2 Alpha

17) SilentTitan: Build Y2 Sky
	SilentTitan: that would have never happened my standard is to build g1 then trade g1 y1 then try to dominate the yellows from there. I'm not going to try to let you have a free level 2 build unless I think I can do you out of something for it.  

18) ajo: Trade G2 Y2 Alpha

19) SilentTitan: Sacrifice Y2 Sky
Move R3 Silenttitan Sky
Move R3 Sky Alpha
	ajo: Ah, I'll keep that in mind for our next game. ;) I usually expect people to immediately go for the color they don't have yet, particularly if it's not red. And an early y3 can really cut down your opponent's options. Anyway, I'm not sure you're going to be able to dominate the yellows anymore...

20) ajo: Trade Y2 R2 Alpha

21) SilentTitan: Build Y2 Sky
	ajo: Blecch. Well played... but possibly overextended. We're both horribly vulnerable right now, by my heuristics.

22) ajo: Build R1 Alpha
Catastrophe Alpha Red
	SilentTitan: hey... this is a clean game you keep your heuristics out of it.

	ajo: Heh. Well, I guess I have to do this now...

23) SilentTitan: Build G2 Silenttitan

24) ajo: Build G2 Alpha

25) SilentTitan: Sacrifice Y2 Sky
Discover G1 Silenttitan B3 Tempworld
Move G1 Tempworld Alpha
Catastrophe Alpha Green

26) ajo: Build R1 Ajo

27) SilentTitan: Build Y2 Sky
	SilentTitan: This is the most unusual game I've played of this yet.

28) ajo: Build R1 Ajo

29) SilentTitan: Build Y2 Sky

30) ajo: Discover R1 Ajo G1 Alpha

31) SilentTitan: Discover Y2 Sky B1 Ground

32) ajo: Build R2 Ajo

33) SilentTitan: Sacrifice G2 Silenttitan
Build Y3 Silenttitan
Build Y3 Ground

34) ajo: Discover R2 Ajo B1 Beta

35) SilentTitan: Trade Y3 G3 Ground

36) ajo: Trade R2 G2 Beta
	ajo: I think you're about to win. Starting without blue is definitely a hard way to start. :P

37) SilentTitan: Build Y3 Ground

38) ajo: Move R1 Ajo Beta
	SilentTitan: I have never won starting without blue. It is a real challenge.

39) SilentTitan: Trade Y3 R3 Ground

40) ajo: Build R2 Beta

41) SilentTitan: Sacrifice G3 Ground
Build R2 Ground
Build R2 Ground
Build Y3 Ground

	ajo: That's checkmate, I believe. Well played. I won't try that again. ;)
	SilentTitan: The weird part of this is... when we started I looked at your starting position and was shocked at what a poor position I was in, because you were going to have a 2nd level piece in a couple of moves.  I thought to myself ... I don't have a standard start against this setup, why haven't I seen this before.  now we know.
	ajo: Those were my original thoughts, too. ;) I think your "trade g3 r3" on move 2 was the killer; if you hadn't done that, it might have worked a lot better for me.
	ajo: One thing I have noticed in real-world games with the no-blue setup is: If you start without blue, your plan for the first few moves must *NOT* be "build, build, move to a blue star, trade for blue, sacrifice to get blue at home". Getting blue is hard, and wastes too much time (at least 5 moves), compared to your opponent who's working on building up his fleet. I think if you start without blue, you need to have a plan for the first few moves like my "get an r2 really early, then build a bunch of 2s" and even then, it clearly backfires quite a lot. :)
