zoltar: Hey we have a chance to win the 4-player game. Jesse almost won (due to my mistake of weakening sordros and not killing him) but sordros resigned just as Jesse was pouncing on him. So I sacked my green to blow up Jesse's green (else he sacks his G3, rebuilds it in his homeworld plus two more free builds, probably an r2 and y2) and your last move puts you in a position to move two y1's into the sardros system and blow up the star and the Y3 which Jesse is about to capture, and which would give Jesse the game (I can't stop him from blowing you up if he gets that Y3 for free). But now if we weaken him, I have a chance to win if I then go after Jesse, and you have a chance to win if you can recover and then attack me when I weaken myself to go after Jesse, so he no longer has a lock on the game as he did a move ago. All in all, the two player version is still better, but this 4-player one has gotten interesting, now that we can stop Jesse from winning and weaken him so that I can attack him before he can move his troops to your homeworld.
MikeYarrum: Oh, secret plans. I forgot he left himself open there.

MikeYarrum: Due to two resignations in my 4-player game with Cinnibar, it's now a Binary game with a lot of extra pieces. I guess I know how that can be...

6) zoltar: Trade G1 R1 Zoltar

7) MikeYarrum: Build Y1 Mikeyarrum
zoltar: I just want to make sure you don't let Jesse have an overwhelming lead and steamroll you before I have a chance to attack him. Besides not letting him have a third y3 ship (meaning he could do consecutive sacs and swarm your homeworld with nasty beasties and threaten multiple catastrophes), you need to move your y3 out of your homeworld: it is 1) a liability, as you have two yellow ships together and a sac could send two ships in and blow them up, and 2) it's an attacking piece, as an r2 can be sacked and capture two pieces wherever your y3 is present, and 3) you have good defence with a red star, plus at least one r2 that could be sacked to destroy two attackers, and the most stable castle (the b3 and y1) with all colors represented only once after the y3 is gone.

zoltar: In my personal game with Jesse, I'm already lost after about 10 moves. I'm no match for Jesse or TwoShort, and it's like I'm playing my first game when I'm up against them.

15) MikeYarrum: Trade Y1 R1 Mikeyarrum
MikeYarrum: For a game that's not even ten years old, Homeworlds is surprisingly deep!

MikeYarrum: Right now, I'm in 24 SDG matches, and half are Homeworlds. I'm wondering if this is healthy...

16) zoltar: Discover Y1 Greendale G1 Greenbelt
zoltar: I think it's good brain exercise. In our four player game, I don't know why you moved you little y1 out and not your y3 as an extra 3-pip at home doesn't do more, and you could have moved your y3 right into rutabaga, where Jesse has an r1 and wants to build reds to then move in and blow up your red star. So I suppose I'll have to move my y3 to rutabaga and stop him from amassing a red fleet at your border!
