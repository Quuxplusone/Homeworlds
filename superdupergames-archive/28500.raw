	Simon: gg. :) It might have remained playable had I sacrificed the other y2, but it would have been hard still.
	endo: Good game! I think you were winning (by gaining total control over yellow) until the last few moves. You should have traded into red to prevent the invasion. Interestingly, I had a draw after your move 22 (which I think I should have taken, objectively speaking). I sacrifice my Y2 and bring my R1 and R2 to your homeworld, threatening to sacrifice the G3 for a catastrophe. You sacrifice your Y3 and blow up my G3 with your G1's. Then we attack one of your G2's back and forth. The system could probably not deal very well with such a situation!
	Simon: Yeah, that's a draw. I don't know what the official ruling is about repetition, there is no draw offer on this implementation at least. I believe it's still a hole in the rules.
 
I should have traded the y2 for an r2 instead of sending in the g1 on move 22, right. Trading for red seemed necessary, but slow; but it was very urgent by then.
	Simon: And I'd always be happy to play again :)
