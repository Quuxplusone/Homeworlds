Any news from your best-games-replay project?
	wil: We are discussing the format, I'd like to make it easy and less complicated so it can be accomplished quickly and improved upon if it shows value...  others want more polish and professionalism....but expect something accomplished early next year.
	wil: on the homeworlds ap front....odds are IOS would be the best format...as it is still the most widely used...
	Broccoli_Commander: OK good news :)
For the app->it might actually be possible to do a multiplatform thing using "Unity"/ but do not expect anything before next year :P
