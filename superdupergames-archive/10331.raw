Variants: "Hard time"
Started: 2008.1.28, Ended: 2008.2.25
Participants: smilingra (S), Jesse (N)
Winner: Jesse

1) Jesse: Homeworld B3 R1 G3
smilingra: I'm a glutton for punishment! Looking forward to learning a bunch more...
Jesse: Very well.

2) smilingra: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3
Jesse: So, what kind of small system marker are you not going to choose? XD

3) Jesse: Build G1 Jesse
smilingra: Yeah, no green planets to make it hard to get into the green economy. :)
Jesse: A medium or large green would be okay. Of course, choosing the same color ship as your opponent makes it easier to maintain a color balance in the early game.

4) smilingra: Build G1 Smilingra

5) Jesse: Trade G1 Y1 Jesse
smilingra: I'll stop copying you at some time - I promise :)

6) smilingra: Discover G1 Smilingra B3 Alpha

7) Jesse: Build G1 Jesse

8) smilingra: Build G1 Alpha

9) Jesse: Build G2 Jesse

10) smilingra: Trade G1 Y1 Alpha

11) Jesse: Discover G2 Jesse Y2 Transience
Jesse: Ordinarily, I wouldn't want to build three greens in my home system, but in the early game it's often possible to get away with things like this temporarily. You have no means of moving a ship here, so I'm not concerned about being near to catastrophe.

12) smilingra: Build G1 Alpha

13) Jesse: Build G2 Transience
smilingra: Understood. I still built a y1 just in case you weren't going to do anything about it. :)

14) smilingra: Build G2 Smilingra

15) Jesse: Discover G2 Transience B3 Directionality
Jesse: So, you leave the G3 for me...

16) smilingra: Discover G2 Smilingra G3 Beta
Jesse: Rather than taking it directly (at Jesse, where you can't reach), I'm going to spread out first, since you're too concentrated to build another green safely. Moving a green up close to your home system increases the pressure on you to diversify there, and prevents you from simply building the G3 yourself.
Jesse: There is another way to deny me the G3, which I will leave for you to discover.

17) Jesse: Trade G1 R1 Jesse
smilingra: How was that?
Jesse: That's the way.

18) smilingra: Trade G1 R1 Alpha
Jesse: Time to pick up a gun, I think.

20) smilingra: Move R1 Alpha Smilingra

21) Jesse: Build G1 Directionality

22) smilingra: Build R2 Smilingra

23) Jesse: Build R2 Transience

24) smilingra: Move R2 Smilingra Alpha

25) Jesse: Move R2 Transience Directionality
smilingra: I'm not sure how all of this is going to play out... you'll have to give me pointers when it's all over (as I'm sure that doing so now would spoil it).
Jesse: Well, you're developing just fine. One fault I can point out is that you've wasted one of your last three turns, by moving the R1 home before building the R2. If you'd built first, you wouldn't have used an extra turn moving the R2 back. You can't avoid inefficient play like that all the time. (Sometimes it's forced.) But you obviously want to avoid wasting turns if you can help it.

49) Jesse: Move R3 Transience Zeta
Jesse: It's painful to be frozen, or nearly frozen, out of any color. But of all colors, it is perhaps most painful to be short on yellow, as I'm sure you're seeing now.

Attack R2 Zeta
Attack R1 Smilingra
Attack G3 Smilingra
Jesse: I'm really not sure why I was focused on getting that r3 into position, rather than using a y3.

smilingra: not that it makes much difference...
Jesse: I'm sure there's a lesson in there somewhere, but I'm not sure how to formulate it beyond, "Watch what's on your doorstep." Good game. You seem to be picking it up quickly. I'll have to remember to be careful when I play against you.
smilingra: Thanks for the words of encouragement. I'm holding my own in a four-player game - we've already eliminated one of them. I think that the main lesson to hold is that you need to keep diversified. When I got frozen out of yellow, I was in big trouble. It's been fun, and I look forward to another match soon.
