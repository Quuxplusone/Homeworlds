	Danner: :)
	jeep: Nod, it was a lost cause.  Thanks for the game.
	jeep: You could have sac'd the red 1 to take over the other, I guess...
	Danner: wow, you are great! :)
	Danner: create catastrophe with moving in ships.
but with building directly im the enemy system? :D Cool strategy :)
	Danner: thx for the experience :)
	jeep: Heh, not sure I'm "great" but yeah, you have to look for catastrophes with both building and moving.  And, of course, color changing...  ;)  Lots of ways to make catastrophes.
