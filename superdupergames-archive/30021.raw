8) Ben10: Trade G3 B3 Ben10
	Felix: Lesson 1: if there's only one small left of a color you don't yet have, it's wise to try and trade for it if possible. Otherwise your opponent may snap up all the smalls, like I just did with the blues, and then it becomes more difficult for you to trade for a blue ship, since you now have to get a medium before you can trade for blue. Make sense?
	Ben10: Makes a lot of sense! Thanks

	Ben10: Haha thank you for pretending ;) I feel very much on the defensive, trying to think offensively a few moves ahead is a bit tricky first time round!
	Felix: No, really. For a first game, you're avoiding many of the mistakes beginners make in their first game. You are keeping pace with my movements. You aren't overpopulating your systems with any one color. You got weapons when I did. Good stuff. It's very hard to develop long term strategies for your first several games, but it will come!
