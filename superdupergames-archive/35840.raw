12) bhorner: Build R2 Bhorner
	bhorner: I'll figure this out someday...  Maybe as my reaction to the first move, I can't do my favorite first move, I need to do something else.  Otherwise I just follow this same sequence, but the other person always gets to go first...

13) Simon: Discover R1 Simon B2 B2

Build R1 Star2
Build R2 Puddle
Build R3 Bhorner
	Simon: I prepared tr y3 r3 b2 for this. But I'm contemplating to discover the y2 to immobilize. Very hard to calculate because this idea does not allow making reds for seveal moves.
	Simon: I won't have time to move for 2-3 days and don't want to rush at this junction :)
	bhorner: I'm going on vacation too (right now), but hope to be able to make moves.  I won't call you on time, so don't worry about it.  (I'd call you on time if you didn't move for 14 days.  :) )
 
This is a good game, making me think more than most (maybe all), I'd hate for you to rush a move.  :)

41) Simon: Build B1 B2
	Simon: All right, I don't see a refutation and it's the more interesting line.
	Simon: Enjoy the break, I won't flag this for at least 2 more weeks either!
	bhorner: Sorry, things got turned upside down a bit.  I will try to move this weekend.  Also, I think generally you are better than me.  I will still try hard, but don't feel bad if you have to force a resignation.  :)
	bhorner: Coming back to this today, I don't see a single thing I can do.  :)
* I can't move any ships but my reds at the y2s
* I can't build anywhere but home, and no matter what I build, I'll end up with three, and unable to move away.  :)
* Any move strands the moving ship, no moves can get a ship in a position to capture.

42) bhorner: Trade R2 G2 Puddle
	Simon: I agree that I can't lose here, the big question is whether I can win :) Most likely, there is a win, unless you somehow make many ships super quickly to hoard the pieces.

43) Simon: Discover B1 B2 B3 B3
	bhorner: You've already got all the yellow though, and it might take more moves, but I don't see any reason for you to ever let one go...  I have this very thin and predictable branch to explore.  :)

44) bhorner: Trade R3 G3 Bhorner

45) Simon: Discover Y3 B2 R3 R3

46) bhorner: Build R2 Puddle
	bhorner: I might have caught on to what you were saying.  It may be that I can't lose, but I kind of can't see how you can win.  You can't capture or catastrophe any of my ships if I never let you have a red...  Until right now, I thought this game could not end in a draw.  :)

47) Simon: Move G1 B2 R3

48) bhorner: Discover R1 Star2 B3 Ocean

49) Simon: Build B2 B2

50) bhorner: Pass
	bhorner: * I have the ammo to catastrophe the red half of your homeworld, but I would let you get some red ships.
* In moving in my reds, I would let you get red ships after the catastrophe, and give up control of my 2 yellow planets.
* I feel confident that you can keep me from getting yellow.
* I'm pretty sure I can keep you from getting red.
* If you have no red, you can catastrophe the blue half of my homeworld, but not the red half.
* If you can never take any of my red ships, you can never take any of my ships.
 
I think that it's a bad move for me to "move the game forward" at this point, because I can only move it forward half way to victory, and it opens the door for you to complete a victory.  I think you can get half way to victory, but cannot complete it unless I mess up.
 
I think it's my plan at this point to play for a draw, I think that's the best result I'm likely to achieve against you (especially in this particular game).
 
Happy to continue for a while (it's definitely possible that I'm wrong, and I actually can't stall the game out).  But if you're ready for a draw any time, I will accept.

51) Simon: Build G1 R3
	Simon: I'll see how much I can do without red. I can keep yellow from you at will, but I have the option to give you yellow if I get something worthwhile in return. Should nothing ever come up, then yes, it would be a draw.

52) bhorner: Pass

53) Simon: Build G2 R3

54) bhorner: Pass

55) Simon: Move G1 R3 Bhorner
	bhorner: I think it's pretty much all you from here until I'm dead or we draw.  :)

56) bhorner: Attack G1 Bhorner
	bhorner: I've made levels and levels of mistakes in my analysis.  :)  I've learned a lot during this game though.  :)  (About things that may never come up again...  lol)

57) Simon: Sacrifice Y3 B2
Move G1 R3 Bhorner
Move G2 R3 Bhorner
Move Y3 R3 Bhorner
Catastrophe Bhorner Green

58) bhorner: Build R3 Puddle
	Simon: Yeah, I can target large ships too, not only stars. Still, it wasn't 100 % clear from the start that I can make enough pieces for that :)

59) Simon: Attack R1 Bhorner

	Simon: Thanks for the game. The most unusual tourney game so far!
	bhorner: lol, I think a draw is possible now.  I think I might have even pulled it off this game if I'd done a couple things different.  Needed a big red at home.
 
It was the most unusual game I've ever played...  I'm glad I didn't realize it was going to be over a lot sooner.  Good game.  :)
