1) TwoShort: Homeworld G2 Y1 B3
	Laurie_Menke: Hi, TwoShort.  I want to apologize in advance...this is my first game of Homeworlds and I don't have a clue what I'm doing!  If you'd rather not play with a newbie, let me know and I'll resign.  Otherwise, I'll do the best I can to keep you from being bored.  :o)  Thanks!

2) Laurie_Menke: Homeworld Y3 B2 G3
	TwoShort: No problem at all;  I'll even be happy to give you whatever tips occur to me, let me know if you'd rather I didn't....
	TwoShort: Tip #1: I'm experimanting by starting with a blue ship; I'd typically recommend Green or Yellow.  In any case, you initial system & ship should cover those three colors (you don't need red until later), and you should use a 3 point for your ship (always), and for one of the system markers (this time, because it's the size I did'nt use)
	Laurie_Menke: Great...thank you so much for your patience and any and all tips!

3) TwoShort: Build B1 Twoshort

4) Laurie_Menke: Build G1 Laurie_menke

5) TwoShort: Build B1 Twoshort

6) Laurie_Menke: Trade G3 R3 Laurie_menke

7) TwoShort: Discover B1 Twoshort Y3 Yellonia
	TwoShort: That's kind of an odd move; You don't really need Red defensively until I have red and can reach you, and you don't need it offensively until you can reach me.  But the early game goal is typically to get more pieces; frequently attempting to grab almost all of either green or yellow (or in theory, blue, as I'm trying forbut that's unusual.)

8) Laurie_Menke: Build G1 Laurie_menke
	Laurie_Menke: Well, my thinking was that this would be my only chance for a while to get an R3, and that you would probably be coming over soon, so I took it.  Now I'm back to building, I think.  As I mentioned before, I have no clue what I'm doing.  But I'm a quick study...I'll lose horribly this game, but I'll gain a better understanding of what to do (or not do) next time.  :o)
