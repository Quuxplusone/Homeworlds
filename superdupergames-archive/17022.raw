	Tank_7: The move I undid was a build green, you could have catastrophe'd 3 of my ships and my only large ship.

22) rootbier: Build R2 Rootbier
	rootbier: Doesn't make you weak - you saw it - and responded ... oh - not so quickly. S'alright - new does not equal weak. And you can blame me for putting us in a "Cage Match" (That's what I have been calling the close quarters homestar setups:) That takes some extra getting used to. End to end with a Y2.
 
...so on the subject (of building things and tempting fate/disaster) are you absolutely sure you like your latest move?

	Tank_7: Before I found this website I was working on my own methods of playing Homeworlds online. One method involved the popular PC game Starcraft, and the other way was a .bmp (basic windows paint file) players could exchange over e-mail or I.M.
	rootbier: Yeah - I am glad this system is here (I pretty much only play homeworlds here at this point). The "chess by mail" style definitely makes it easier to find time to play - but carries with it certain inherent drawbacks. I should use the notebook more - but when I actually do see something great it seems so clear that I always think I will remember it when I come back.
 
It won't let me take you out in a blaze of catastrophic kablooey. So. I will content myself with knowing I have two large red ships floating out there and eager to avenge the rootbier civilization.
