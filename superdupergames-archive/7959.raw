	TwoShort: I think you've got me...

	zoltar: Well, I was going to resign when you blew up my greens, but kept playing as to not piss you off.  If I had a chance in this game, I didn't see it.  At least I got to put a piece in your homeworld before I died.
	TwoShort: I feel bad that I got upset in that other game.  I over-reacted an I apologize.  It's obviously your right to resign if you don't think you can win, but this game is a good example of why I don't think you should.  If you built an r2 at Greenbelt, and (depending what I did) moved your b3 home before attacking, I didn't see a way to stop you.  
	zoltar: I'll have to set up the position and check it out.  I was still demoralized by missing that you could take out all my greens earlier.
