	w00t: right... trap... admittedly, your fleet is one to be feared; and now you are a single hop from my homeworld

45) w00t: Build Y1 W00t
	Draw5PlayAll: No... I still need two moves. If you wanted distance you took out the right star.

Move R3 Draw5playall G2
Move R3 G2 W00t
Move B3 G2 W00t
	w00t: uhh.. right... that's what I was saying... like it'd take a y2 to hop once to a temporary star before you can reach mean... instead of two hops... I guess I just picture it differently :)
	w00t: *mine

47) w00t: Trade G3 B3 W00t

48) Draw5PlayAll: Sacrifice R3 W00t
Attack B3 W00t
Attack Y1 W00t
Attack Y1 W00t
	Draw5PlayAll: I leaked a blue so this makes me slightly nervous...
	w00t: yeah... you've got the attack ability to back that up... I'm trying to come up with a clever solution :)

	w00t: I choose that move solely so I can say you didn't lock me out of blue the entire game :D
	w00t: Very fun game :) I'll post a new challenge if you're down for a rematch
	Draw5PlayAll: Too little, WAY too late. How many movies or other stories end where the guy gets his/her life wish or something right before dying?
 
And I took your blue back anyway.
 
I think the game would have been a lot more competitive had you traded for a B3 instead of discovering all those systems.
	w00t: I took a gamble, and it didn't pay off... >>shrug<< still fun to try different tactics
