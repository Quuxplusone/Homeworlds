Keith: I was playing a dangerous game by not trading into a yellow ship. I miscalculated that I could force one out of greenbelt.

30) zoltar: Build G1 Zoltar

31) Keith: Build B2 Hydra
zoltar: You'll probably win this, as you can now easily get all the blue ships and at least one of the big greens. Since I have a lock on the yellow's, I won't resign, and I'll see if I can hold out. I've lost just about every homeworlds game these days. My beginner's winning streak seems to be over!
Keith: Actually I think I have figured out a way to get a yellow but it will take 5 turns and cost me 4 reds.

Keith: I did have most of the blues at one time. Was it a mistake to trade them in?
zoltar: No, that's what they're good for: trading them for big ships in other colors. Now I have to figure out a way to do something before you get yellow ships and overrun my fleet.
Keith: I found a flaw in my plan for a yellow in five turns at the cost of four reds. I am going to have to proceed some other way that is not clear to me yet.

Keith: I don't know. The last time I made a move after my bedtime against you and left one color of ships in my homeworld was a disaster.
zoltar: And the Yellow Fleet is still mine! Yay!
zoltar: Yep, with one color in your homeworld and my retaining the yellow fleet, you'd better watch out!
Keith: Darn you clever Zoltar! I did not go for the y2 because I thought bumbing the number of yellows to three in the stash would keep one in reach while you took a big ship hit.
Keith: And it is not like all the ships in blueridge were going to slip away.
zoltar: Zoltar will defeat you yet, primitive carbon waterbag unit! Without Yellow warp-drive technology, you will never reach the Zoltarian Homeworld! Bwahahaha!

43) Keith: Discover B2 Drift G2 Ghaaa
zoltar: At least Zoltar got to threaten mate-in-one last move!
zoltar: Zee only gude hyu-maahn bean ease a dead hyu-maahn bean!
Keith: Did not and do not see that mate-in-one or how discovering a b3 with an r2 diffused one.
Keith: Wait, that was the other plan. How did sacrificing a g1 to build an r3 avoid a mate-in-one?
