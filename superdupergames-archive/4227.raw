26) zoltar: Trade B1 G1 Zoltar
	zoltar: Ouch! I wasn't paying attention. I'm probably toast, now.
	mneme: did you miss the catastrophe?
	mneme: ah -- yes.  Yeah, probably, though if so, this will be the first game of BH I win.

27) mneme: Build Y3 Mneme

28) zoltar: Build Y3 Zoltar
	zoltar: It took at least a dozen games before I won one -- this is a very hard game to learn, and the tactics are very tricky. 

29) mneme: Discover Y2 Houston B2 Prince

30) zoltar: Trade Y2 G2 Zoltar
	zoltar: well, yes, I I did miss that previous catastrophe, but I've been able to quickly get a 3-pip ship in my homeworld, so I'm safe now, and only a tempo or two behind. Had you been able to stick a 3-pip ship in my homeworld before I could get my defences back, I would have lost in two or three moves. Luckily, I picked a pretty safe position to make such a key blunder!

33) mneme: Sacrifice Y3 Mneme
Move Y1 Houston Prince
Move Y2 Prince Zoltar

Catastrophe Zoltar Y
	mneme: It's true -- it just seemed like too much trouble to "waste" multiple moves stopping you from getting that 3 (and it might not have worked in any case).  But yeah.

Catastrophe Zoltar Red

	mneme: I think that's game, no?  I don't see a save.
	mneme: (I think someone got greedy)
	zoltar: yes, it's been over for a while, I was waiting for you to do something before I resigned.  Good game.
	mneme: Thanks -- good game!  (I -think- if you'd taken my small red ship before I activated the doomsday device, you might have been able to keep me at bay long enough for your superior numbers to tell -- but I could be wrong)
	zoltar: Yeah, you're probably right, but I had to sack an R2 to take it, and then you immediately rebuild the R2 again -- that's what I was thinking, so I'd sort of given up at that point. I'm still an advanced beginner at this game, even though I have an inflated rating because I beat up on total beginners most of the time. And unlike chess, etc., there are no books to read or download with puzzles and annotated games to increase my strength. I'd like to get better at the game and I wish there were a lot of amazing tough players to spar with, or even computer opponents, like there are in chess.
	mneme: Hmm.  Point -- ish.  There are -some- amazing tough players -- Andy is ver good, frex.  But playing against new players doesn't sharpen your skills much, I suppose (haven't done much of that, actually).
