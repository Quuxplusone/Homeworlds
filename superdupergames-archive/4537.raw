	zoltar: Well, I'm already about to resign this one...
	zoltar: Yeah, I don't have a chance in this one. 
	mneme: Er.  If you say so -- I'm a very weak player (why I've been playing banker later) and I had many, many opportunities to fail utterly at stoping my booted food into your face.  
	mneme: Ok, getting a second large green soon was very strong, but still losable given sufficient blunders.
	zoltar: I figured that after the last game, you're as good as I am, and I can't stop you from getting the 'factory' with that next large green, so that you can make 2 builds every move, so I figured I am lost for sure.  I've lost 5 or 6 straight games now (not including silly 4-player ones, which are sort of random), and it's been a while since I've played well at this game.  
	mneme: True.  But you could still have put me on the defensive nicely, especially since there was no way for me to suck up all the green without giving you an opportunity to cause a catastrophe. I still had a monocolored homeworld, which was badness.
	zoltar: Yes, that makes sense -- I didn't think about that but just figured I was doomed again. :)
