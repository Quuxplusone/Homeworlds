Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2017.11.9, Ended: 2017.11.13
Participants: smokeytroll42 (S), Babamots (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) Babamots: Homeworld Y1 B3 G3

2) smokeytroll42: Homeworld B2 G1 Y3

3) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots
	Babamots: In case you're curious, I like to have yellow for a home system marker for two reasons:
* It gives me the opportunity to discover a new system about one turn earlier than if I didn't start out with yellow. However, it also means I have to resist the temptation to discover before it's a good idea.
* If my opponent wants to destroy my home by catastrophe, they normally have to have a yellow ship to sacrifice--in order to get ships into my home faster than I can attack them. To destroy my blue marker, they need a yellow for sacrifice and three blues. To destroy my yellow, they need four yellows. I believe it's usually slightly harder to get four ships of one color than to get three ships of one color and one of another.

4) smokeytroll42: Build Y1 Smokeytroll42
	smokeytroll42: Ok. 

5) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots
	Babamots: Your homeworld setup is largely a matter of taste. I don't think there's anything wrong with yours at all :-).

6) smokeytroll42: Build Y1 Smokeytroll42
	smokeytroll42: Yeah, I wanted to try something different from the last game. It seemed like the red Homeworld didnt do me much good.

7) Babamots: Discover G1 Babamots B2 Sauria
	Draw5PlayAll: I like to be able to put yellow ships in my homeworld, thus the blue+red star and green ship.

8) smokeytroll42: Discover Y1 Smokeytroll42 B3 Leo

9) Babamots: Build G2 Sauria

10) smokeytroll42: Build Y2 Smokeytroll42

11) Babamots: Sacrifice G3 Babamots
Build G2 Babamots
Build G2 Sauria
Build G3 Babamots
	Babamots: So here's a factory in action. I effectively get two build actions at once. Taking up the last of the medium greens makes it more difficult for you to get any green ships at all.

12) smokeytroll42: Move Y2 Smokeytroll42 Leo

13) Babamots: Trade G2 Y2 Sauria
	smokeytroll42: Cool

14) smokeytroll42: Trade Y2 G2 Leo
	Babamots: Even though it gives me a chance to get a g3, you might want to trade y2 for g2 in Leo while you have the chance. Not having any green ships would be rough.
 
You could also trade something (probably a y1) for a red ship. Either way, I'm pretty sure it's time to diversify.
	smokeytroll42: That makes sense. Seems like going by too hard in one color really stunts your growth.

15) Babamots: Trade G2 R2 Babamots

16) smokeytroll42: Trade G2 R2 Leo
	Babamots: I needed to remove a green from my home immediately since otherwise you would win by sacrificing your y3 to move in your g2 for a catastrophe.

17) Babamots: Sacrifice G3 Babamots
Build G2 Babamots
Build G2 Sauria
Build G3 Babamots
	Babamots: That's probably not a great move since I just got a red. You don't want to be more than one move behind on getting your first red ship. If I move one of my mediums to Leo now, I'll be able to capture something. I'll wait a while to move in case you want to undo.

18) smokeytroll42: Build Y2 Smokeytroll42
	smokeytroll42: Thanks! My thought process was to trade the Y2 for an R2, but I realized after that you could still get your R2 to Leo before I could get one. I suppose the obvious move would be just to trade one and not build a new one.

19) Babamots: Discover G2 Sauria B3 Risa
	Babamots: I think trading y1 for r1 at your home system was the best move (you could sacrifice it if I try to attack you elsewhere). Trading away your green means you have no green again. More generally, I try not to trade a ship that is already the only one of its color in its system (let alone in my whole fleet).

20) smokeytroll42: Trade Y3 G3 Smokeytroll42

21) Babamots: Sacrifice G3 Babamots
Build G3 Babamots
Build G3 Risa
Build R1 Babamots
	Babamots: For now, I'm just working on getting as many ships as I can as fast as I can while trying to prevent you from getting the big ones. The next phase will be to spread out my greens so I can build some g3.
Your best move now might be to trade y3 for g3 at home. After doing that, it won't be safe for you to *build* the other g3 at home (since I could cause a catastrophe), but at least you would have one green ship.
Alternatively, you could discover a g3 system so that I can't get two new g3 ships.

22) smokeytroll42: Build Y2 Smokeytroll42

23) Babamots: Trade G3 Y3 Risa

	smokeytroll42: Haha, well call it a draw? Just kidding. Ill resign, but Im down for another. Im very much appreciating your continued mentoring.
