	dlwillson: Remember to always count the bank. Be aware of what you're making available to the other person, and whether you get one, too, if they do. That G2 was a pretty nice gift and you're still stuck building ones, at least for a while.

	dlwillson: How are you liking SDG?
	daselva: I´m liking SDG very much.I only regret that players take to much time to make their moves and so I just can´t feel the flow of games ,what makes difficult the «learning curve».I´m feeling with these 2 games that I´m finding very interesting:Homeworlds and Pikemen.Do you like others?

37) daselva: Attack R2 Daselva
	dlwillson: Yeah, moves tend to go pretty slow here. One a day is about the best you can expect. Sometimes faster, sometimes slower.
 
There is no "flow" to a Homeworlds game, because, as they say, no plan survives contact with the enemy. You really have to look at the board every turn, especially here.
 
I've only tried one other game one time, here on SDG: Mirador. I liked it. Very simple concept, but a neat game, and it can be played in pen and paper.
 
Are you good at Pikemen? I'd be happy to join you for a round. I've played in plastic, but not on SDG.
