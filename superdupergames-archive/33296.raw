	dlwillson: I see that mneme is doing well. He's a very strong player. He hasn't been active on the ladder for a long time, but he and I used to take turns trying to beat...
	dlwillson: TwoShort. He's *very* hard to beat. I'd say that TTT is the only player stronger, but I've only seen TTT in a few games. As near as I can tell, he doesn't make mistakes.
	wil: Then there is broccoli commander... We are missing the four top names!!  
	dlwillson: What do you mean "the four top names"?

	Felix: Not my wisest move, but it's dangerous to corner a wild animal :P
	wil: I mean you ain't playing!!  
	dlwillson: Saw it coming! :-)
 
I thought to myself, "Felix can easily hand the game to Wil. I probably would, in his position."
 
I should've swapped something, so I'd be two-colored at home.
 
Good game, y'all!
	wil: You only gave him the choice of losing or insuring you didn't win...  But that is twice you two combatting provided me the easy win... And twice the luck of the draw put us in the same position.  Id like another game... Is it possible that we arrange the positions differently?
	wil: I'd also like to try four person partners.. Take any opponent out and the other resigns....partners take the same homeworld setup (banker, goldilocks or fortress)...  Who for the fourth?
	Felix: Yeah... I would lose if I kept it going, so I just wanted to give wil the victory to spite you for attacking me :)
 
Good game! I'd be up for trying again, or for 4p teams. Maybe ts52 or mneme if he's willing for the 4th.
	dlwillson: I'm down for whatever, but someone else has to set up the next one.
	Draw5PlayAll: I thought in teams, if one member of a team dies the other just has a disadvantage (or maybe not even that).
	wil: D5PA...who cares what the rules say on SDG...we can make up our own win conditions.  When one member dies, the team loses is my suggestion. 
	Draw5PlayAll: I have done 1 or 2 team matches unofficially and we used the "must eliminate both". I think we should put it to a vote, except that we would have an even number...
	wil: Is there really such thing as a team match that once one is eliminated the solo player comes back to beat the other two??
	Draw5PlayAll: I think it is similar to the red ability: it is more of a deterrent to certain types of plans than a thing you actually use often.
 
Also, it might be that one of the players (nearly) sacrifices himself to take out a member of the other team, and quickly it becomes a 1v1.
 
Then again, probably we should play it your way just because last time we did it mine and it is "only fair".
 
I'll alert the crew.
