	Felix: And I believe that's it. Good game. For next time, a good tip would be to try to not let me get all of one color (like green). If you get locked out of a particular color, it will make things very difficult for you. Cheers! And rematch me any time.

38) Felix: Attack Y1 Random56
	random56: Thanks for the tip,  I really wanna get better. And good game. 
	Felix: I'm not totally advanced myself, but I am happy to help you get better. Make sure you get all of the colors if possible. If you see that there is only one small of a particular color left, and you don't have that color yet, try to trade one of your smalls for it. That's a good general rule, but you shouldn't necessarily always do that, depending on the circumstances.
	Felix: As a beginner, it's also a good rule of thumb to always start with a large green ship. This allows you to set up what's called a "factory" which is what I have in my homeworld right now. Late in the game, you can sacrifice your G3, then rebuild it and build two other ships elsewhere. It's a great way to get an edge over your opponent.
	Felix: Also, using a small and medium for your homeworld is good as a beginner. This is called the "banker" setup and it allows you easier access to large stars that you can potentially trade in later for large ships. Finally, it's always a good idea to try to get a red ship whenever your opponent does. If he has a red ship and you do not, that means trouble!
