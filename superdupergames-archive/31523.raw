	mneme: Argh.  I am getting no notifications at all.  So if I lose because of that...well, I do.  :(

6) Babamots: Trade G1 Y1 Babamots
	Babamots: For what it's worth, I seldom go a whole day without making a move. If you move at the same time every day, I'll usually have played before you get back.

7) mneme: Build R2 Mneme
	mneme: Fair enough.  But I'd -really- like to just get the email; I got the notification of the challenge, so I have -no- idea why the per-move emails aren't happening. :(

8) Babamots: Build Y1 Babamots
	Babamots: Maybe it's because I had my loyalists on your planet sabotage your interstellar transmitter. Bwahaha!

	Draw5PlayAll: Trek reference? If so, which series (TOS, TNG, DS9, VOY, ...)? Please no spoilers.
	Babamots: Galorndon Core is from TNG season 3: "The Enemy." Are you watching Star Trek? And if so, which series?

	Babamots: I suspect you meant to type into the Move Box. It would be a shame for you to time out since I think you'll beat me.

29) mneme: Discover R2 Betazed Y1 Jumper

30) Babamots: Build G2 Galorndon
	mneme: true.  I got it eventually; was wondering why it was not updating.  :)
	mneme: You did get the first extra large.  That's a bit deal, but I do have some other advantages.

	Babamots: I think I lost when I didn't have red to keep you from taking Betazed.
	mneme: Red and yellow are super-important, it's true.  This is very much a game where you only have to be one move ahead to crush someone, if you can leverage it properly and not make too many mistakes.
	mneme: But I think you could have come back from that if you found a way to leverage your extra large before I caught up; it's why I needed to keep up the pressure.


35) mneme: Sacrifice B1 Mneme
Trade R2 B2 Betazed
	mneme: still, I can't stop you from getting a large red, so...we'll see.

54) Babamots: Build R2 Euterpe
	Babamots: I was unhappy that destroying that fleet gave you a g3, but I eventually decided that it was worth it.
	Babamots: I'm working on a couple of deadlines right now, but I'll move again when I've got time to study this properly.

	Babamots: Well, I'm feeling a lot more secure than I was a month and a half ago. Are you still not getting notifications?
	Draw5PlayAll: What are Vidiia, K t a r i s, and any others I missed?
	Babamots: Ktaris (from Voyager) is the homeworld of a couple of minor Star Trek characters (Etana Jol and the father of  Naomi Wildman). Vidiia (from Voyager) is the homeworld of the Vidiians, who are basically space zombies. They're all infected with a plague that makes their organs shut down, so they harvest organs from other races. Mab-Bu IV is a gas giant with a (barely) habitable moon. The Next Generation crew found disembodied souls there that were not friendly.
	Babamots: Oh, and Betazed is where telepathic Betazoids are from (including Deanna Troi's family).
	mneme: Well, I found where in the spamtrap they're ending up, but no, I think they're still getting blocked there.
