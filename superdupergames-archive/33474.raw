	Draw5PlayAll: Absolutely yellow vs blue... very interesting.
	wil: Dang it...you've done it again!   I see a notice...I think my opponent has moved...and I get to contemplate a move...or he has commented and I need to respond...  No...just the peanut gallery popping in.  I am so confused...I have played you...you comment less during a game when I am playing you...and do this when I am not??  Have I not mentioned enough that I find it irritating? 
	wil: Sorry...can't delete...clicked on this right after a Trump and Tax and Racism discussion...while the sentiment is true...the rant stems from a previous discussion without which I prolly would have just grumbled under my breath....again.

17) wil: T B3 Y3 Out
C Out Y
	Felix: Quite understandable. Between Trump, Taxes, and Racism, that's a lot of volatile ground to cover in one discussion.
	Felix: I only get email notifications when an actual move is made, so that saves me that headache at least :)
	wil: It isn't the email notifications.... I open the page and it shows a bolded and non bolded games,  A MOVE TO MAKE!!!!   Like pavlov's dogs I salivate, adrenaline courses thru my veins, I tap the screen in anticipation and a balloon lets go and flies backwards thru the room deflated from dissapoimtment...

18) Felix: Trade Y2 R2 Felix
	Felix: Oh, haha. I almost never just open the page. The home page takes too long to load. I just come here directly from the email.

19) wil: Trade B3 G3 Wil
	Felix: Good move.

20) Felix: Move R2 Felix Out

21) wil: Sacrifice G3 Wil

	wil: I don't open the main page either...just leave a game open and look to the right to see if anything changed...I try to play enough games that I have a move a day...prefer a dozen!  I only get to sit down and play live games two or three nights a week.. 

22) Felix: Move G3 Felix Out
	Felix: "only" .... "two or three nights a week"
I'd be grateful to get that many! With a 2-year-old and a baby on the way, I'm lucky to get one live game a year.

	wil: congrats on the kids!! mine are out of college and on their own.. As those little time absorption capsules grow up you'll be able to play with them!


	wil: That was exciting... for a moment I thought I was cornered.
	wil: Kids...you've got so many memories you are making...  you've taken me down memory lane with my twins...from pregnant to three... what a glorious time... Your younger one will come out making neuro connections by the second....your older child has now three times as many connections as we do...and will spend the next 13 years pruning...through their experiences and life around them they will be choosing which connections to eliminate, not needed, which ones to move over to other similar needs, and which to turn into super highways of accessible thought... 
	wil: me thinks this game is over and unimportant in the larger scheme of things...however that other game that you are playing... that is one to focus on!!
	Felix: Ooh, well played! And thanks for the congrats and, um, scientific poetry? It's all very fascinating :) And good point that they'll make good opponents in years to come!
