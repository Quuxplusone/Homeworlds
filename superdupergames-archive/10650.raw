benji_stein: I'm not terribly experienced with homeworlds, but It's fun, and I'd like to get better. Feel free to point out my mistakes, so I can learn from them.

2) benji_stein: Homeworld G2 B3 Y3
jeep: I'll give it a shot, but I'm not great at this game either.

benji_stein: Could we try to pick up the pace a little? Your moves all seem to take several days.
jeep: Not really. I chose 3/2/10 because that is the pace I can maintain. When I'm not too busy, I speed up and clear the queue every day. But my moves will generally take close to 2 days per move.

14) benji_stein: Build Y2 Benji_stein

15) jeep: Build Y2 Changer
benji_stein: OK, I guess...

16) benji_stein: Trade Y1 R1 Benji_stein
jeep: Sorry if it's too slow... You can always start another game. Then you're more likely to have a play to make every day.
benji_stein: That's OK. I was actually playing a few others, but they ended recently. I realize that it doesn't have to be played as fast, but all ther others seemed to be. I guess I'm just a little impatient about it. I'll try not to be - work and other things are a good reason to take your time.

benji_stein: If you had tried, I would have destroyed a lot of your ships...
jeep: Impossible. I would not have built, I would have moved into large green worlds. Taken them out of circulation instead of building them. Then later, I could have probably cashed them in.
