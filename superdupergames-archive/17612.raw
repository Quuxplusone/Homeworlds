	AdamBadura: As to Alien City I still don't know the rules. Something is wrong either with me or with them as I tried at least 3 times and failed every time... ;)
	goulo: They are strange rules when you read them, I agree! All the information is there, and I think they're even clear and complete rules, and not very complicated, yet I still sometimes have to check things to be sure I'm not confused. :) If I ever make a physical set (I just need to make 20 tiles...), we can try playing in person...

84) goulo: Build Y2 Goulo
	AdamBadura: An interesting situation. I hoped I will be quick enough. As it seems I wasn't and now goulo will win.
	AdamBadura: zara2stra, unless we prevent goulo from killing me in his next move we will lose. I have only one B ship (in Runaways) which I could move (by sacrificing some Y ship) to Citrono.
 
But this is not enough obviously. You would have to move your B ship (from Aeon) too. Also by sacrificing your Y ship.
 
This would prevent goulo from winning in next move. Are you willing to do it?
	goulo: haha! I wondered if you would propose that. :)
 
BTW I am exploring costs of acrylic laser cutting, as a possible way to make Alien City tiles. :)
	AdamBadura: That is one of the things that puts me away from Alien City. It is not "pure Icehouse"... ;)
 
I considered costs of laser cutting/drawing after I saw some 18xx track tiles made in wood with laser (on BGG).
	goulo: BTW I thought of building a b3 at Rubenego, then decided against it exactly because you alone could move 2 blues to it, whereas at Citrono you'd have to convince zara2stra to sacrifice as well. :)
	goulo: My Alien City will almost pure icehouse. I don't want to use "domes", but simply small pyramids, for example. So only the board will be non-pyramids - and that's true for many of the icehouse games that use a board. :)
	AdamBadura: Can you somehow notify zara2stra that I am awaiting his decisions here? As he likely wont come here until I make a move.
	goulo: You can geekmail him at BGG; he is zara2stra there.
	zara2stra: Sorry guys, I just read the message on BGG - if there's a situation like this in the future, just mail me: zara2stra@gmail.com. As for your question, I'll help you catastrophe citrono, if you'll also withdraw the r3 from my home system at the same turn. 
	AdamBadura: Its a high price considering you already gained R3 and if we don't prevent goulo we both lose, not just me... Let me consider this...
	goulo: Ha, surely no price is too high to avoid losing immediately! :)
	goulo: You should be required to move your r3 back to drydocks so there can then be a red catastrophe there more easily. :)
	AdamBadura: Also moving both B and R requires me to sacrifice an Y3 rather then Y2...
	AdamBadura: Which leaves me defencless in my homeworld. It seems the only way to avoid loosing is to convince zara2stra to make a move which will make him lose earlier... ;)

85) zara2stra: Move R3 Zara2stra Drydocks
	zara2stra: That wasn't nice.
	AdamBadura: Yes. But it seems that goulo's victory was unavoidable anyway...
	goulo: wow, that's a complex situation now!

86) goulo: Sacrifice Y2 Goulo
Move R1 Goulo Adambadura
Move R1 Adambadura Drydocks
Catastrophe Drydocks R
	AdamBadura: Yes. That is why I love this game so much.
 
By the way. Will any of you be on Gratislavia? On the first day (Saturday) I will be among the staff, but likely on Sunday I will come as a gamer.
	goulo: A2na and I are going out of town for the long weekend, so unfortunately we will miss Gratislavia. Bad timing. :/
	goulo: Your resignation is an interesting example of "what do you do when you can't win?" I.e. you could have kept playing and lost, with me winning. Or you could resign, leaving a complex situation where you lost, and it's unclear whether I or zara2stra will win. So either way you lose. If zara2stra wins now, then you did kingmaking. Or did you? Or was it kingmaking regardless of who wins now, since your resigning prevented my imminent victory and made the situation complex and unclear? Some say you should never resign from a multi-player game. Etc.
 
I suspect a BGG thread about this game would get many diverse comments. :)
	AdamBadura: You are free to post it on BGG. ;)
 
I resigned as I knew that me staying in the game has two possibilities: 1) either I will convince zara2stra to make a move bad for him which would prevent you from winning and allow me to win before you rebuild an threat or 2) I will soon lose to you.
 
First one would be a great achievement. More diplomatic/negotiation than strategic. But still a good one (or at least for me: I like this aspect of gaming). But clearly zara2stra foreseen my evil plans and this will not happen.
 
Second does not change my situation to the current one (me resigning). Although it may change yours, so lets think about it.
 
My resignation makes the game unclear to you. So it could possibly take your victory. (Or maybe it didn't: if I kept playing we would go into destroying your B threat and then it would be a race for you and zara2stra who first destroys me. Keep in mind I already had to do it once in a previous game, I had to destroy you to prevent zara2stra from doing it as I could have won but required more moves than zara2stra...)
 
Also I like to see it as it is often interpreted in Through the Ages where player leaving the game is formalized and allowed explicitly by the rules. Playing against someone in TtA requires some sacrifices (of actions) and if the attacked player resigned from the game in response you do not gain anything while you already payed the costs. So hitting the weakest player or doing a fatal blow is risky. This does not translate directly to this game where destruction of your enemy is the only way of winning. However I do like to think that a good threat must take into account resignation of defender. So you cannot rush to much and sacrifice to much as you might end up exposed.
 
All in all now you have some more gaming... ;)

	zara2stra: Thanks for the game, but goulo should be the winner. In my opinion, when Adam resigned, he shifted the balance to my advantage: My homeworld was safe for a time, because Goulo's ships where earlier targeting an entirely different system, and I was free to carry out the plan I already had. All in all, I feel that Adam resigning was unfair. 
	AdamBadura: Maybe indeed it was.
 
But maybe as I already suggested my resignation was a punishment of a weak victory plan goulo had... ;)
	zara2stra: Anyway, I'm eager to exact my revenge live on sunday :D
	goulo: Hope you got to play today! We were out of town at a different event where I got to play 4 games of RAMbots, woot. :)
	AdamBadura: No. Somehwo we didn't meet today although I was there from 12 to 16.
