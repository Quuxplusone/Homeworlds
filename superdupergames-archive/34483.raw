Homeworlds Online (SDG# 34483)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2018.8.23, Ended: 2018.9.6
Participants: Babamots (S), eliscinsky (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) eliscinsky: H R1 B2 G3
	eliscinsky: Sensei, I amd eager for your instruction of my humble self.

2) Babamots: Homeworld Y3 G2 B3
	eliscinsky: Using a basic starting Homeworld. The one Andy and others say is a good place to start.
	eliscinsky: Also, since we have not played each other in the tourney yet, hopefully I will become a better player for that match.
	Babamots: I believe that your opening move is the strongest one if you go first. I'm deliberately taking an opening that I consider less good.

3) eliscinsky: B G1 Eliscinsky
	Babamots: And for anyone who's observing, this is a teaching game and not for the tournament.
	Babamots: Side note, there's a tricky thing I've seen a few times lately that you should know about. If you are moving first, the only safe color to have as a small system marker is red (yellow isn't too bad though). If you have a b1 or g1 for a home marker, your opponent can usually choose their homeworld to lock you out of that color.
 
Say you chose the slightly different opening move
 
1. homeworld r2 b1 g3
 
Then I could lock you out of blue with
 
1... homeworld g3 b1 b3
2. build g1 eliscinsky
2... build b1 Babamots
 
I just have to trade my b3 for y3 to have a pretty normal position and quick access to medium pieces (b2) while you can't get blue ships for a while.
 
I could do a similar thing if you had a g1 for a home marker or even yellow, but in the yellow case, I would end up with only green and yellow in my home world and have to discover a blue system before my position stopped being very weird.

4) Babamots: Build B1 Babamots
	eliscinsky: I suppose the 1st several rounds will be building up.
 
Also, after this move I'll be resigned to mostly playing outside of work hours. :)

5) eliscinsky: T G1 Y1 Eliscinsky

6) Babamots: Build B1 Babamots

7) eliscinsky: T Y1 B1 Eliscinsky

8) Babamots: Discover B1 Babamots G1 Risa
	eliscinsky: I traded for a blue 1 so I wouldn't be locked out of that economy for a while.
 
Is that what you would have done? (a simple yes or no is enough for now)
	Babamots: Yes, I think that's the right move.
 
It looks like we'll split the b2 ships evenly, one for each of us. Next you'll probably  want to look for ways to either 1) prevent me from getting b3 ships or 2) make sure that you get at least as many of them as me.

9) eliscinsky: Build B2 Eliscinsky

10) Babamots: Build B2 Risa

11) eliscinsky: Trade B1 Y1 Eliscinsky

12) Babamots: Trade B2 Y2 Risa

13) eliscinsky: Build Y1 Eliscinsky

14) Babamots: Build B1 Risa

15) eliscinsky: Build G1 Eliscinsky

16) Babamots: Build B2 Babamots
	Babamots: Even without my prompting you, I guess you noticed that it's not safe for you to build more blue at home. Since blue is the color giving access to medium and large ships now, you may want to move your blue to a g3 system so you can get some big ships. Otherwise, I'll happily start gobbling up the b3 and then start trading them for large ships of other colors.

17) eliscinsky: D B2 Eliscinsky G3 Ds9
	eliscinsky: But you don't have access to my system yet.  Or have I missed something.  And with only 2 blue left I would think I should get at least one of them. And let you create the 3 star to gain access to my homeworld. That way I could trade a 3 for another, maybe yellow to gain the movement I need to get to you, or red to protect / attack.
 
Is my strategy flawed?

18) Babamots: Trade B1 R1 Risa
	Babamots: From here I can sacrifice my y2 to send a b1 to your home for a catastrophe, like this.

19) eliscinsky: Move Y1 Eliscinsky Ds9
	Babamots: I was planning to let you undo your last move, but it occurs to me that you might not be able to undo after I made a move and hit undo. Can you still take it back?
	eliscinsky: I still have an "Undo Last Move" buttton. okay I see the issue.  TY

26) Babamots: Attack Y1 Ds9

27) eliscinsky: Trade G1 B1 Eliscinsky

28) Babamots: Discover B1 Babamots G1 Betazed
	Babamots: If your opponent gets a red ship anywhere, you have to expect him to sacrifice it for an attack if he gets the chance. It's almost always best to get a red immediately after your opponent does. Otherwise, he can get the drop on you and you'll just have to run.

Attack Y1 Eliscinsky
Attack R1 Eliscinsky
	Babamots: I've never had anyone start cooperating on my Star Trek system name theme before. Do you have a favorite series?
	Babamots: You've set yourself up to compete for the yellow ships, which is good. You actually have the advantage there since you have your yellow more spread out than me, so I'll have a harder time building them safely. You also have a g3, which you could sacrifice to quickly take three yellows if you felt like it, possibly denying me any y3.
 
Your biggest liability now is that large blues are already available (large ships are a big deal), and I am better prepared to build those. I'll be able to build b3, trade for y3, and build b3 again.

37) eliscinsky: Move Y2 Vulcan Eliscinsky

38) Babamots: Attack Y2 Eliscinsky

39) eliscinsky: Move Y3 Betazed Babamots
	Babamots: Leaving your home system without a large is very dangerous. Right now, I can move my b3 to your home, so I can attack your large as soon as it arrives to defend. You're welcome to take back that move if you'd like to try something else. If you want to do that triple build, I think you should move one of the yellows out of your home first so you can safely build a y3 at your home for defense.
	eliscinsky: I think maybe I waited to long.  I do NOT have an undo button.  oh well.
	Babamots: OK, well let's see what I can make out of this then.

40) Babamots: Attack B1 Eliscinsky
