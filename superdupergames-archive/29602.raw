	Felix: Hi there! Is this your first time playing the game? Got any questions? Hope you have fun!

3) aRough1: Build G1 Arough1
	aRough1: Yeah first timer! Getting used to word commands! Will do my best!

4) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	Felix: Not a problem! I'm always happy to help new players get used to the game. The word command system is a bit clunky at first. One tip is that you don't have to type out the entire word. Just the first letter will suffice. So instead of typing "build g1 aRough1" you could type "b g1 aRough1" Make sense?
