Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2020.5.8, Ended: 2020.5.11
Participants: Babamots (S), StormCrow (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) StormCrow: Homeworld R3 B2 G3

2) Babamots: Homeworld Y2 B1 G3

3) StormCrow: Build G1 Stormcrow

4) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots
	StormCrow: Good Luck, have fun
	StormCrow: quick movement world this time i see

5) StormCrow: Trade G1 Y1 Stormcrow
	Babamots: Andy calls it the "quick start," but I think of it as the "Make it harder to get all the yellow ships I need" start. I generally think it's worse than blue-red, but I give it a try once in a while anyhow.

6) Babamots: Trade G1 Y1 Babamots

7) StormCrow: Build G1 Stormcrow

8) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots

9) StormCrow: Discover G1 Stormcrow Y1 Zork

10) Babamots: Build Y2 Babamots

11) StormCrow: Build Y2 Stormcrow

12) Babamots: Discover Y1 Babamots G3 Risa

13) StormCrow: Build G1 Zork
	Babamots: If I had a red star instead of a yellow, I could've built a y3 just now. It illustrates what I was saying earlier about yellow stars being weak. These contests for early yellow ships are common, so yellow home stars often hold you back.
	Babamots: On the other hand, a yellow home star can be nice later in the game. In this game, if YOU want a doomsday machine, you'll need three blue ships and lots of yellow. That may be harder to gather than what I need, which is some blue, some red, and some yellow. You'll have to really dominate the yellow economy for a doomsday machine whereas I will only need a modest share in three economies.

14) Babamots: Sacrifice G3 Babamots
Build Y3 Babamots
Build Y3 Risa
Build G2 Babamots

15) StormCrow: Discover G1 Zork Y3 Xyzzy
	Babamots: And that type of move is why I'm pretty convinced that it's always best to start with a large green ship. You can sacrifice it later for more larges.

16) Babamots: Trade Y3 R3 Babamots

17) StormCrow: Trade Y1 R1 Stormcrow

18) Babamots: Move R3 Babamots Xyzzy

19) StormCrow: Move G1 Xyzzy Babamots

20) Babamots: Sacrifice G2 Babamots
Build Y1 Risa
Build Y3 Babamots
	Babamots: I've leaving my home without a large, but I'm not too worried about it since you can't get there with a large in one turn, and I expect to be able to build another large there on my next turn (sacrificing g2).

21) StormCrow: Build G2 Stormcrow

22) Babamots: Trade Y2 R2 Babamots

23) StormCrow: Build Y2 Stormcrow

24) Babamots: Discover Y1 Risa B1 Bolarus

25) StormCrow: Build G2 Zork

26) Babamots: Attack G1 Babamots

27) StormCrow: Trade G2 B2 Stormcrow

28) Babamots: Trade G1 B1 Babamots

29) StormCrow: Discover R1 Stormcrow G1 Polaris

30) Babamots: Move R3 Xyzzy Zork

31) StormCrow: Sacrifice G2 Zork
Build R1 Polaris
Build G2 Stormcrow

32) Babamots: Attack G1 Zork

33) StormCrow: Move G2 Stormcrow Bolarus
	StormCrow: Yea, putting a third blue piece at home would have been dumb, let's find a better second build
	Babamots: Since I'm ahead on large ships, I would happily sacrifice a y3 to destroy one of your home stars, which I could do if you build another blue.

34) Babamots: Sacrifice G1 Babamots
Build Y3 Bolarus
	Babamots: You could rebuild your g2 at your home.
	Babamots: I see you were ahead of me :-)
	StormCrow: Felt that getting 2 builds was better than using a yellow to run or just leaving one ship behind there by escaping the g2 instead

35) StormCrow: Sacrifice R1 Polaris
Attack Y1 Bolarus
	Babamots: I think that was your best move.

36) Babamots: Sacrifice R2 Babamots
Attack Y1 Bolarus
Attack G2 Bolarus

37) StormCrow: Build R1 Polaris
	Babamots: My little ship found a big friend. :-)

38) Babamots: Trade Y3 R3 Bolarus

39) StormCrow: Move Y2 Stormcrow Polaris

40) Babamots: Build Y3 Bolarus

41) StormCrow: Move B2 Stormcrow Polaris

42) Babamots: Sacrifice Y3 Risa
Move Y3 Bolarus Stormcrow
Move R3 Bolarus Stormcrow
Pass

43) StormCrow: Attack R3 Stormcrow
	Babamots: Good, now I can't do that trade-rebuild trick with yellow anymore.

44) Babamots: Sacrifice R3 Zork
Attack R3 Stormcrow
Attack G3 Stormcrow
Attack Y2 Stormcrow
	Babamots: Hmm, I've been focused on building big ships and didn't notice how close I was to victory. If I'd noticed this a turn earlier, I'd've said something instructive and tried to formulate a desperate defense. As it is, you'll get a textbook example of a red-powered invasion.

	StormCrow: Thank you again for the complete defeat.  I need to learn how to get ahead in the ship race obviously, i seem behind quickly in all the games I play.
	Babamots: Sorry, I didn't give as much advice as I had intended. When I practice with people in-person, I can give timely warnings when they reach for bad moves, as in "Ooh, you're not going to want to do that and here's why." On SDG, I don't know what people are thinking until they've made the move, and by then it's a pain to back up.
	Babamots: The clearest problem spot in this game was your 7th move, just before I got way ahead in yellows.

You would have benefitted from discovering a new system (of any color) with your y1. This would have done two things:
1) It spreads out your yellows, so you're prepared to build a y3 if I try any tricky sacrifice builds.
2) It also would have made it so you could catastrophe my home star if I did my sacrifice build right away (imagine the position below but with one of your g1's replaced by a y1. You can sacrifice your y2 to devastate my homeworld).
