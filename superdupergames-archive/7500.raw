69) MikeYarrum: Discover Y1 Osaka R3 Kimura
	Jesse: Hrm.  That's pretty uncool, in a sinister game.  At least I didn't have to make a big, crippling sacrifice to get in there.

70) zoltar: Move G2 Bluemoon Sordros
Catastrophe Sordros G
	sordros: Oops, my mistake Jesse... This is my first sinister game.  I thought it would grant you the win if I resigned.  I apologize.

72) MikeYarrum: Sacrifice Y2 Osaka
Move Y1 Kimura Sordros
Move Y1 Verdosia Sordros
Catastrophe Sordros Yellow
	Jesse: Okay, Sordros.  Now you know.  Of course, if it *had* given me the win, that would have been unfair to someone who might have been able to defeat their target before me.  (You never know!)  In a sinister game, it's best to stick it out.
	Jesse: On another topic, you do know what your big mistake was, don't you?
	zoltar: Not as big as mine, which was to weaken but not obliterate Sordros after his big mistake!

73) zoltar: Move R2 Zoltar Verdesia
	Jesse: Indeed, Zoltar.  That's risky business.  You did profit well from it, however.

	zoltar: Can anyone see the stashes at the top?  I click on refresh and then tried another computer, but they don't show up for me.
	MikeYarrum: I can't. It's a bug that's hit another Homeworlds game I'm in.

	Jesse: <sigh>  Nothing like being consistently teamed against to spoil my game.  Congratulations to Zoltar on his impending win.  I only hope it's premature.  XD
	MikeYarrum: Well, he wins pretty much every game he and I play against each other. Why should this be any different?
	zoltar: Actually, up until this move, I thought Jesse had the game, but seeing those two y1 ships, I had no choice but to sac my y2.  Now I'm stronger, but it's far from over, as now that I've prevented you from wiping out the yellows of MikeYarrum's homeworld, Mike is stronger as well, and has a chance to attack me if I'm overtaxed going after the Jesse homeworld.  Btw, I've never won one of these multi-player games yet, and Mike, I'm having as hard a time with Jesse in one-to-one games as you are with me (wait till you play TwoShort -- you won't even see it coming and then BOOM), so you have a reasonable chance here. I have less of an advantage now than Jesse had 3 moves ago. My biggest advantage is that you might not get the timing and sharp tactics right to attack me just when I'm weak and sacrificing to attack Jesse, but if you do, you could pull off the win, letting us go at it while you build and then striking at me at the right moment when I'm weak.

95) Jesse: Move R3 Sordros Verdesia
	Jesse: Mike, I believe it's in both of our interests for everyone to get stronger at this point.  That may even make what Zoltar says about not having a big advantage true.
 
Zoltar, I think you're nuts to think I had a big advantage, before.  Maybe I could have, if Mike hadn't blasted yellow at Sordros.  After that, I'd spent about 4 turns on that attack with no profit (and minus a Y2 sacrifice) to show for it, and had ship distribution problems besides.  Having that b1 at Sordros was a particular problem, given your then-impending collection of blues at Verdesia.  Besides that, you had a significant lead in production potential (close to achieving a factory lock-out).

96) MikeYarrum: Build Y1 Verdosia

97) zoltar: Trade B1 R1 Verdesia
	Jesse: Argh.  I'm blind.  That'll teach me to chat and play at the same time, I suppose.  :P
	zoltar: Well, it's not like it's a real time game and you don't have time for both!  Now Mike has the strongest fleet...

	Jesse: Here, I've got my doomsday machine all set up, but need to take a couple of extra turns to make sure Zoltar can't blast the green marker after I blast the red... and he opens up the opportunity for me to blast ships instead, making my last few moves irreleant.
	Jesse: Good game, guys.
	MikeYarrum: Well, it was wait until you got your machine in gear, or try to catch zoltar with a surprise move. In retrospect, it might not have been the best idea, but things were sticky in this game since way back.
