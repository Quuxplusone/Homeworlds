3) Broccoli_Commander: Build G1 Broccoli_commander
	Marmalade: This is probably my eighth or ninth game of Homeworlds, total. I've lost all of the online ones, and won all the face-to-face ones, but that's mostly as I've been teaching people how to play.
 
I wanted to try Homeworlds for ages, and just recently imported some pyramids for the purpose.
	Broccoli_Commander: Imported? Where do you live?
 
And don't worry about the online losses there are some monsters online... Plus Homeworlds is not particularly forgiving for mistakes
 
And well this must only be my 20th game or so. I received some pyramids recently and we tried homeworlds once with a friend by chance. We didn't know it before but I thought it was a great game. Unfortunately I don't get a lot of opportunities to play it in real life so I'm really glad that there is this website!

4) Marmalade: Build G1 Marmalade

5) Broccoli_Commander: Trade G1 Y1 Broccoli_commander

6) Marmalade: Trade G1 Y1 Marmalade
	Marmalade: The UK - Looney Pyramids failed their EU safety check thing a couple of years ago, so retailers can't sell pyramids in Europe (outside retailers selling to individuals is fine). Looking at the paperwork, it looks like something that could be easily argued against, but it's probably not within Looney Lab's means (especially as their main market is in the US).
