	Felix: Thanks! I didn't realize quite how good my last move was until after the fact.
	wil: Wanna finish your move?  
	wil: I don't feel right taking advantage of an sdg issue
	Draw5PlayAll: Then just call the catastrophe yourself.
	wil: Lol...we can play our own game...upto Felix...if he don't wanna replay it, I'll take the offering.  
	wil: Lol...we can play our own game...upto Felix...if he don't wanna replay it, I'll take the offering.  
	wil: Note, I opened this game to take s look since it looked like Felix had replied.  In general, when in a game I prefer discussing the game with my opponent, not the peanut gallery.  While I am not fully versed as to the proper decorum, it is my preference.

36) Felix: Sacrifice G2 Felix
Build G2 Wil
Build G2 B2b
Catastrophe Wil Green
	Felix: Oh, sorry for not seeing this. I tend to only come to the games when it's my turn so I usually don't see messages when it's not my turn. It was actually intentional to not call the catastrophe. All part of my plan... I think :) Is your move the one you actually want to make?
	Felix: And then he realized it wasn't a very good idea after all.

37) wil: T R1 G1 Wil
	Felix: I must have been thinking that waiting to do the catastrophe would give me a chance to grab that G3, but that was a really stupid idea hahaha. Big mistake. You're welcome for the offering! Take it with my best wishes.
	Draw5PlayAll: Question mark?
 
Also, I like how you guys are using my naming conventions now.
	Felix: You didn't invent the convention, Draw5. Wil's been using it since before you were a gleam in the SDG registration page's eye.
	wil: Sure...although I'd like to know why you wouldn't want to catastrophe!   (I have no issues losing games, look at my record, I like playing and leaning and experimenting)

38) Felix: Trade G2 Y2 B2b
	wil: Lol, yes d5 I was given some grief when I started... It stemmed from attempting to play blind...most didn't like it.  Folks that imitated I would start naming g3 systems y2...then they quit complaining... But welcome to the cult young padwan
	Felix: My hope was that you would do something OTHER than sacrificing your G2, so that on my next turn I could build the last g3 and THEN do the catastrophe. In retrospect, it was an awful idea that would never have worked. Whoops!
