Homeworlds Online (SDG# 2627)
Started: 2006.3.2, Ended: 2006.4.15
Participants: sketchwick (S), Jesse (N)
Winner: Jesse

1) Jesse: Homeworld G3 B2 Y3
	Jesse: Hello.  How's it going?

2) sketchwick: Homeworld B1 R2 G3

3) Jesse: Build Y1 Jesse
	Jesse: You should probably go read the strategy tips for beginners on the wiki, if you haven't.  Most experienced players prefer not to choose a red system marker.  (Or maybe I assume too much, and you have some particular strategy in mind.)

4) sketchwick: Build G1 Sketchwick
	sketchwick: I never read any tips, just played a lot of games with jeep as we were both learning.  Forgive me if I don't present a challenge

5) Jesse: Trade Y1 G1 Jesse
	Jesse: It's no problem.  Would you like some coaching?

6) sketchwick: Trade G1 Y1 Sketchwick
	sketchwick: I'm always open to hearing ideas

7) Jesse: Build Y1 Jesse
	Jesse: For one thing, it's generally not considered a good idea to use red for one of your system markers.  It doesn't help you early on, it can't be sacrificed to use the power in another system (so you still need a red ship somewhere when your opponent gets a red ship), and when your opponent does invade your system, you both have access to the red power.
	Jesse: On the other hand, it does make it possible for you to freely choose between maintaining either a large green or a large yellow at your homeworld (or, later, both), both of which can be quite useful.

8) sketchwick: Build G1 Sketchwick
	sketchwick: Yeah, it's the other hand that made me choose it...you first comment made it sound like you could sacrifice stars...if this is true I'm unaware of the rule.

9) Jesse: Trade Y1 B1 Jesse
	Jesse: No, you can't sacrifice stars.  That was the point.  Because you can't, it can only help you in your home system.  Once I get into red ships, you'll still need red ships of your own, to protect yourself elsewhere.

40) sketchwick: Trade G2 Y2 Ox

41) Jesse: Build G1 Core
	sketchwick: Maybe I'm only good enough to see the advantages you've gained, but not good enough to see my own...
	Jesse: Well, you have a factory and fairly well distributed pieces.  The factory isn't operational right now, but once the greens run out you'll have a production advantage if I can't put a stop to it.  For that reason, I think your last move really plays against your strength.  It gives me a chance to get more greens with which to threaten you.

45) Jesse: Discover R1 Jesse G1 Chon
	Jesse: On the other hand, that's not half bad, either.  I should have given more thought to this possibility.  <sigh>  Did you notice that this is a difficult game?  :)
	sketchwick: I'm sure you've played a LOT more games than I have...jeep and I learned about the same time if not exactly the same, so our first few games weren't very complicated.  :)
	Jesse: It can get very complicated.  I'm definitely going to have to think a bit more on this one...

	Jesse: Well, thank you for a good game.  It didn't work out for you this time, but you've shown me that the red-blue homeworld has more value than I had given it credit for.  I'm trying it out for myself in a couple of games, now.
