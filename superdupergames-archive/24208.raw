	Broccoli_Commander: Thanks for the live play! :-)
	Marmalade: Damn, I didn't see that at all.
 
Thanks for the game. I've yet to win a game of Homeworlds on here :)

	Broccoli_Commander: Well that's the danger of trying to get an early color monopoly... The payoff for the factory would have been great though. This is why I liked your opening! 
 
But then I think you lost too much time by defending your little green ships in Formalhaut: 
-You could maybe have "teleported" them (sac g1 to rebuild it 
somewhere else)
-Or just let me the possibility of attacking them. At least this would not have refilled the green stash as your trades did!
