	Babamots: Is this game for the tournament? If so, it didn't get recorded. The same goes for dlwillson's games with Draw5PlayAll and ts52. If these are tournament games, you're the first person to get every game underway!
	Trydnt: I don't think this is for the tournament
	dlwillson: I think this is for the tournament, but since I'm.about to 
	dlwillson: As I was saying:
Since I'm about to lose, I'd be fine with this *not* being a tournament game.
	dlwillson: As I was saying:
Since I'm about to lose, I'd be fine with this *not* being a tournament game.
	dlwillson: As I was saying:
Since I'm about to lose, I'd be fine with this *not* being a tournament game.
	Trydnt: is there any way to check the notes line of the challenge after it's been accepted? I'm in several games some non-tournament and some tournament so gets tough keeping track
	Babamots: As far as I know, there's no way to see the challenge notes after the game starts. How about the clock setting? If it's not 2/2/7, it theoretically shouldn't be a tournament game.

	dlwillson: Good game! I was certain that I was going to run out of ships and you were going to pull the win.
	dlwillson: With regard to the tournament, I think I forgot to report the the games Babamots asked about. I mostly play from my phone. That's my excuse. I'll report the other two when I get to my computer.
 
Trydnt: Should this game count for the tournament, or shall we play another?
	Trydnt: let's play another. I don't believe this was a tournament game because I've been working my way up the tracker starting with lowest score people and moving on to tougher opponents (not perfect as not everyone has played as many games but good enough). Since you're at the top I was waiting until further in the tournament to challenge you. I'll launch another now
