	dlwillson: OK, time for lesson 1: Never waste a move. Always be playing to win. If the win isn't in sight, play to improve your position, or damage my position, or to stop me from doing that to you. This move should work with your next move, unless I surprise you. Try to limit my options.
	dlwillson: Building another yellow is probably stronger than trading to green, right now.
	dlwillson: Trading to blue is also stronger.
	dlwillson: At this point in the game, you're trying to lock me out of a color and/or get a medium ship before I do.
	dlwillson: I'll give you a day to take back your turn, if you want to.

	dlwillson: I hope you have a plan here. It's pretty unusual to move a ship to a star of the same color, unless doing so accomplishes some larger goal. For example: TwoShort ~loves~ to run his opponent out of yellow, and he'll do whatever it needs to get it done.
	dlwillson: I'll give it 24 hours again, in case you want to take it back.

22) dlwillson: S G3 Dlwillson
B B2 Field

	Weishaupt: Haha, well, again, this is my first game.
	Weishaupt: So I admit to not knowing what I'm doing. This game takes an odd sort of thinking.

	dlwillson: I just broke a strategic rule by leaving my home system without a large, but I checked carefully, and I think I can cover it before I regret it.
	dlwillson: Great job gobbling up all the yellow. Two Short would be proud.
	dlwillson: What happened?
