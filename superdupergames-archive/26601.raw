	TeeTeeTee: You might as well have attacked that g1 on your last turn - I'd have lost more ships.
	TeeTeeTee: Thanks for the game. I liked your opening, but I feel like you would have been in a stronger position if you'd pushed your blue advantage more at the start, i.e. not traded a b1 for an r1, or a b2 for a g2, but kept building blue ships for as long as you could get away with it.
	wil: I would've, but you immediately traded for a B3...ended that gambit...
