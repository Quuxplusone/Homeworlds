Participants: Felix (S), bhorner (N)
Winner: bhorner

2) Felix: Homeworld B1 G3 B3 *

3) bhorner: Build G1 Bhorner
	Felix: I intend this game to be for the homeworlds tournament 2019. Are you good with that?
	bhorner: Oh yeah, that's what I expected.  :)
 
And I also set up my planet, and thought you might do what you have done, to see if I was right that I can get around it (I thought at one point I could, but will have to re-figure it out), sorry if I move more slowly in the beginning here.

4) Felix: Build B1 Felix
	bhorner: I just reread the rules stuff, I guess it was my responsibility to say this was an official tournament game.  :)  Sorry for missing that, I just got back from a long trip.  I just filled out the form, and this game should show up in the matrix now.
	Felix: Not a problem! I often forget who's supposed to, myself. I figure whoever actually initiates the challenge should do it, but either way... as long as it's on the map!
 
Take as much time as you like. I'm never very confident about this opening myself, but I think it's fun to try out!

5) bhorner: Trade G3 B3 Bhorner

6) Felix: Trade B3 Y3 Felix
	bhorner: Seems like I possibly had an extra move, and didn't need to do that immediately, but I couldn't make myself sure.  :)  Hopefully I haven't lost my first player advantage.
