Homeworlds Online (SDG# 756)
Started: 2005.9.26, Ended: 2005.10.26
Participants: Werebear (S), CDRodeffer (N)
Winner: Werebear

1) CDRodeffer: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3
	CDRodeffer: Hey, Doug. Glad you could make it into the system. The first step is to create your homeworld using the "homeworld" command. I'll make mine using "homeworld b1 y2 g3".

2) Werebear: Homeworld G2 B1 R3

3) CDRodeffer: Build G1 Cdrodeffer
	CDRodeffer: Now that you have a homeworld, you can try some of the other stuff at the top, like constructing a new ship. If you have access to green in a system, you can build the smallest available ship of any type you already have in that system. I'll do that using "construct g1 CDRodeffer".

4) Werebear: Build R1 Werebear
	CDRodeffer: So anyway, you have a bit of a problem starting out, because you don't have access to any yellow, so you can't move anywhere or discover new systems. You might want to build another ship (it would have to be a red one, using "construct r1 Werebear"), then on a later turn trade it in for a yellow one so you can move around using "trade r1 y1 Werebear" or the like.

5) CDRodeffer: Trade G1 R1 Cdrodeffer
	Werebear: Yah, I guessed as much. I do, however, have a red ship. I've heard all about people who sneak right in when someone doesn't have enough planetary defenses. That's all this is. Defensive uses only.
	Werebear: Besides, where do I need to go? We're happy right here!
	CDRodeffer: Oh, I totally understand. In fact, I like to have at least *some* access to all four color technologies in my home system. Right now, I don't have any defenses, as you can plainly see. So I would to well to get at least a small one. I can do that by trading in the small green ship I just build for a small red one, using the command "trade g1 r1 CDRodeffer". See how easy that is?

6) Werebear: Trade R1 B1 Werebear

7) CDRodeffer: Discover R1 Cdrodeffer G3 Eden
	Werebear: My people are afraid of too many different colors... but we applaud your work towards self defense. Might we agree to a mutual self-defense treaty? If either of us is attacked by an enemy, we'll use our brave self defense ships to protect each other?
	CDRodeffer: I think that would be a wonderful idea, at least in principle, but I don't know how we would implement it in the short term. See, for one or the other of us to get to the other's system, we need to go via another system that has a star unlike any of our own. In our cases, we both have a small star and a medium star, so we need to go via a large star. Since there isn't such a system out there (yet) I'll show you how to discover one by example. I'll choose green, since it's pretty, and since it's non-confrontational. Whenever you discover a new system, you also get to choose it's name, so I'll pick a nice non-confrontational name as well. The command I'll use to do it is "discover r1 CDRodeffer g3 Eden".

8) Werebear: Build B2 Werebear

9) CDRodeffer: Build G1 Cdrodeffer
	Werebear: I like the way you think, CDRodeffer! (Is it okay if I call you CDR?). Now, I should say that my people are a bit skittish and not as open-minded as my Enlightened Self (you can call me Werebear), so they might not like having foreign ships in our home system... but - our self defense forces have been well versed in interacting with alien cultures, and I'm sure they'd have no problems (and might even enjoy) visiting your home system from time to time. You know, for training exercises, and such. I'll spread the word around our self defense forces officers, that they'll be visiting you at some point in the future! What sorts of gifts are appropriate? Do you like Xcyactl wines? If so, I'll get a few cases put together to send with my forces. It may take me a while, since it is very expensive to get that much Xcyactl.
 
Interesting - my people have ancient myths about how we originated from a star system called "Eden". If you find any interesting archaelogical sites there, I'll send some very peaceful scientists to visit and help your research...
	CDRodeffer: Well, we're tea totelers here at CDRodeffer, even though we really don't even like tea. Or Dr. Pepper. Or coffee. But anyway, I look forward to meeting your archeological envoy in Eden in the near future. As an aside, I heard it through the grapevine that "andylooney" just joined up an online gaming site called Super Duper Games. This is intereseting, Werebear, because I hear that he loves Homeworlds, and might enjoy visiting your peaceful system someday. Anyway, back to the matter at hand, I realize that it is unseemly to have a defense ship in an archeological region, but I don't currently have propulsion technology available in Eden, nor can I find any local paint shops to make that little ship seem less, well, threatening. Our ancient texts say that an angel wielding a flaming sword was set at the gates of Eden, so if your people have similar ancient texts, you might want to just, for a moment, meditate on the aesthetic qualities of that small red ship, right there, guarding Eden. But just for the moment, I assure you, because I have a plan to retrofit that ship into a vessel more suitable for acheology.

10) Werebear: Trade B2 Y2 Werebear
	CDRodeffer: Oh, if you didn't recognize the name, Andy Looney is the person who designed the pyramids for this game. He's pretty well-known in the gaming world, and has designed several games to play with these pyramid pieces, although the Homeworlds game itself was invented by a friend of his.

11) CDRodeffer: Trade G1 Y1 Cdrodeffer
	Werebear: CDRodeffer, you make many good points. I trust if the dreaded andylooney does find his way to our beloved home system, that you'd leap to our defense, as per our mutual defense agreements. But we don't fear him. He causes us no concern. Also, our people were quite thrilled to learn of your archaeological discoveries - and they demanded that we learn more of this. You see, my people, at times, are a superstitious and hasty people, and they've long debated over our origins. Learning that you've positively identified our original home, and are even now valiantly defending it, will cause waves of anxiety and happiness amongst our populations. Rest assured that we are even now equipping a squadron to come to your aid, and to assist you in the defense of this beautiful world. We very much appreciate the pictures you've sent, by the way. Especially some of the more risque pictures of your cabinet and ministers - but not sure what you intended for us to do with them. Perhaps you sent them to use for safekeeping? We'll guard them carefully, and gazed upon on them in our chambers whilst we plan for our eventual and inevitable meeting! It will surely be an auspicious occasion!
	CDRodeffer: Our short range scanners have been admiring your beautiful new yellow speedster. I must say, I've always had a fondness for yellow, rising each morning to the light of our yellow sun, and silently morning its setting in our early afternoon when we are left with the pale blue light of our yellow sun's companion. You know, we have a notorious college near where I live whose colors are yellow and blue. Actually, they call them "maize" and blue, but I don't fully understand their reference to a labyrinth. But yes, per our mutual defense agreement, I'd be happy to help thwart any invasion attempts by the dreaded "andylooney" in the near future. Alas, as I still have no access to propulsion systems near Eden, withdrawal of that unseemly red clunker has not been easy. But now, having seen, admired, yea even coveted your speedster, I should be able to upgrade said clunker in the not too distant future. Meanwhile, our technicians are doing their best to reverse-engineer and copy your marvelous work. Feel free to peer through your long range scopes to have a look for yourself.

12) Werebear: Construct B2 Werebear

13) CDRodeffer: Build G1 Cdrodeffer
	Werebear: Ahh, yes, thank you. We were quite delighted with it! We took the court out for a spin in it, and had quite the splendid time. However, I must warn you, it requires outrageous amounts of fuel. I'd advise you, most respectfully, of course, to stay with the smaller more fuel efficient ships. We've found that we can't even afford to crank up the engines in our primary self defense vessel. I probably shouldn't admit this, since I know you are counting on to rush to your defense should andylooney strike, but, there it is. The large ships are just too expensive to have much fun with. If you do get stuck with any large ships that you don't want, just let us know and we'll be happy to take them off your hands for you. Fortunately our home system does possess vast quantitites of fuel. Talk to your engineers, see if you can dissuade them from their mad plan. Small efficient ships will one day rule the star ways. My people are just to grandiose to realize this!
	CDRodeffer: It's a good start that you understand how important it is to conserve energy resources, and I'm glad you've taken such notice in our efforts to conserve energy by using smaller ships. Sure, there will always be a few piggy politicians who insist upon large ships. They must be trying to compensate for something. But by and large, most of us get along very well with small, efficent ships. While we modeled our little runabout after your speedster, we decided to go with a smaller platform for just that reason, and are quite pleased with the results. If you would like a tutorial on our compact engineering, we would be happy to give you an in-system demonstration at some point in the near future. Just let us know, and we'll try to be there at the appointed time. Meanwhile, you can watch from afar as we demonstrate small vehicle construction, right before your very telescopes.

14) Werebear: Move B2 Werebear Eden
	Werebear: CDRodeffer, you old fox - you read between the lines, and you invited me to see up close how you build more efficient ships! I was hoping you'd see what we were hoping for, and of course you did! I'm tickled pink, but some of my staff didn't believe you'd actually invite us to come visit. This is our first voyage away from home, and you can probably imagine how excited our people are. We're sending our best and brightest to join you in your exploration of Eden. You'll see that we come entirely in peace. Don't worry about meeting us, we'll come out and meet you. Oh, this is just *TOO* thrilling!

15) CDRodeffer: Sacrifice Y1 Cdrodeffer
Move R1 Eden Cdrodeffer
	Werebear: Hi, there! We come in peace, and bring you greetings from the peoples of Werebear! And look, we have Xcyactl! For you... no, please, please, take it... our pleasure entirely!
	CDRodeffer: Likewise, it's a real honor to finally see one of your vessels up close, here in Eden. I wonder, have you tried using this Xcyactl as a fuel? Alternative propulsion systems just might be the thing you need for better economy, both at home and abroad. Say, there's another new piece of technology we just developed, and I thought you might like to have a look. It's a remote control function that our engineers -- what will they think of next!? -- have come up with. Since that r1 has been sitting out there in the remote reaches for so long, we need to figure out how to get those people home for resupply anyway, so what better way to try out the remote control function? Funny thing is, it takes lots of energy to operate. LOTS of energy. Fortunately, we have that little yellow runabout (it wasn't that useful for us anyway) that we can dump into our E=mc^2 converters. So check this out!

16) Werebear: Build R1 Werebear

17) CDRodeffer: Build G1 Cdrodeffer
	Werebear: Hey, what happened? We got word of some sort of diplomatic incident, and then, wow, your defense ship was gone? And we were looking so closely at your new fuel efficient speedster, when suddenly we noticed a disruption in the space-time continuum, and it was gone! Have your crews had Xcyactl before? That may explain parts of the strangeness, if they haven't - it does make weird ripples through the multi-space. Oh, wait - I see - remote control. Okay, whew... I was worried that my overly eager researchers made some sort of faux pas, which would be sad. Hey, can you share that trick of recycling ships? We'd like that... We're very much into recycling. No, we don't use Xcyactl for fuel. Well, actually, the very rich might. I had a patron as a young Werebearling who tried it out in a sand-speeder - and it was, let me tell you, quite the ride. But I don't recommend this for any but the very young and the unsqueamish. Since we don't have anybody protecting the Origin Star (as our religious leaders are calling Eden), my advisors have decided to send out another scout to protect that system - purely defensive, you understand.
	Werebear: CDRodeffer, this is the commander of the B2 Research Ship in orbit around Eden. We will relieve your crew of their defense responsibilities. Support is on its way for our defense of this system, but perhaps this larger ship will scare off any attacks by the dread pirate andylooney. On the behalf of our people, I want to thank you for finding the planet of our origins, and for beginning the shared growth of knowledge our research will bring. We commend you on your spirit of cooperation and trust. Commander Flemlink Potorsk, Werebear Defense Fleet.

18) Werebear: Build B2 Werebear
	CDRodeffer: We'd be happy to share the remote control technology based upon direct matter to energy conversion. But you must understand that the technology hasn't yet been perfected to 100% efficiency, as most new technologies are, and as a result, performing the conversion requires certain ... sacrifices. But in the interest of advancing science, and especially science for ecological development (first reduce (use small ships), then reuse (trade them in for what you need whenever possible), then recycle (matter to energy conversion, when necessary)). It's all rather simple, really. Say, how go your acheological digs on Eden?

19) CDRodeffer: Build R1 Cdrodeffer
	Werebear: Our digs go well! We think we found the flaming sword your people talk about... Well, actually, it wasn't flaming, exactly... and, well, to be honest, we're not sure it's really a sword. But, what the hay, our religious leaders are all saying they found the flaming sword, who am I to argue? To me, it looks like a big lumpy rock stick. Thanks for sharing that remote control technology. Our scientists have been experimenting on hamsters and tulips, and results are relatively positive. Relatively.

20) Werebear: Build R2 Werebear
	CDRodeffer: I have rather sad news concerning our economy. Trading has been down the last several days, and as a result, the people are getting somewhat restless, requiring some police actions in some regions. Nothing dangerous, I assure you, but we've seen much better times in the past.

21) CDRodeffer: Move R1 Cdrodeffer Eden
	Werebear: It isn't catching, is it? Oh me... oh my! We've just got word that we, too, might be having to engage in police actions ourselves. We surely hope not. If things get bad over there, you're welcome to visit. And fear not - if they get bad enough, we can help you with your police action, if need be. We'll be there in a whistle!
	CDRodeffer: Wow. You don't know how glad I am to hear this news, and about how willing you all have been to provide for the common defense. Our most heartfelt gratitude goes out to you as we struggle with the domestic problems of looting and, believe it or not, environmental degradation that has resulted from the economic greed of a few big wigs in high places. I'm sure you can sympathize.
	CDRodeffer: Holy smokes! We seem to have lost contact with your archeological team at Eden! I hope they're all OK. You know, some people are calling for scientific research programs to be cut from the global budget in these times of civil unrest, but of course, you and I both know better, that without the advancement of knowledge, the populous is in danger of spiraling into barbarism. We wish we had a little yellow speedster available to go visit your archeological ship via the fastest means possible, but since all of them were so unfortunately recycled, a "Little Red Corvette" will have to suffice. Speaking of which, there once was a legendary musician who sang a song about such a vehicle some 20 years ago. Judging from your distance, the radio waves may just now be reaching your system from those early broadcasts. If you care to give a listen, I'd much appreciate your comments on our music.

22) Werebear: Sacrifice R1 Werebear
Attack R1N Eden

23) CDRodeffer: Discover R1 Cdrodeffer Y3 Taxi
	Werebear: We noticed the same thing. We were afraid that sword of fire rock-stick-thingy had gone crazy and had taken over our crew. We immediately dispatched an identical Little Red Corvette (yes, we recall that song) to balance out your ship - but - egads! Your ship was gone, and the flaming sword rock-stick-thingy was gone, and our crews were all befuddled. For some reason, the Interstellar News Service (INS) reported that there was a fight, but clearly we wouldn't have attacked each other. That makes no sense at all. Where did your ship go?
	Werebear: CDRodeffer, I can only conclude one thing. I suspect that this was all the work of the Dread Pirate andylooney (DPa). I'm afraid to say it, but it looks like he must have snuck in under the watchful eye of our research and defense ships, stolen the flaming sword rock-stick-thingy, and then, to add insult to injury, stole your ship to make his getaway. We've detected some space tread marks and a faint smell of ether. I think we've both been had. I'm very worried about this turn of events. I'm afraid our religious leaders will call for all-out war, demanding that we seek out every haven that the DPa might lurk in, and to regain our holy religious rock-stick-thingy heritage artifact. Woe is upon us. I hope we can find a way to convince our peoples that everything is still in balance. The time for caution has arrived. Will you need us to dispatch our LRC to your Homeworld? Are you prepared for the civil unrest that might follow? Remember, give a little whistle and we'll be right there to help. We're listening...
	Werebear: Was that a whistle?
	CDRodeffer: Well, I suppose the driver of the Little Red Corvette *could* have gotten lost in space. Maybe. Oh wait! I think we found them, and they're reporting the discovery of a new system! This has cause much rejoicing here at home, despite the big wigs' wanting to name the new system, of all things, Taxi.

24) Werebear: Move R2 Werebear Taxi
	Werebear: Oh, is that where he went? Cool... but - our Space Traffic Control Agency thought that this ship originated from your home system, so... umm.... it can't be the Dread Pirate andylooney, unless...

25) CDRodeffer: Discover R1 Taxi R1 ã±ã±
	Werebear: Maybe we'd better just drop in for a little look-see... we'll report our findings. We're sending broadcasts of Peace and Understanding. But you ship is unresponsive. Is that your ship? Or could it be the DPa? Arggh! We'll stand by to hear from you on this very serious matter. Our religious leaders are certain that we'll find the rock-stick-thingy at Taxi - you haven't seen it, have you? Could it be aboard your ship? Gosh, I sure hope not. I'd hate to think what would happen. That ship we sent there is full of zealots. Oh my!
	Werebear: Peace. Understanding. Peace. Understanding. Repeat as necessary.

26) Werebear: Build R2 Werebear
	CDRodeffer: Wow! Check it out! That Little Red Corvette found another new system. Weird how the name came out, though, huh? There must be something strange going on with the navigational systems on that ship.
	Werebear: Our religious leaders will have a field day with this... they've long warned us of the day when someone would visit Ã£ï¿½Â±Ã£ï¿½Â± - and warned us that when we saw the "visage of the unmasked treachery of this world, surely the dogs would gnash their teeth, and doom would befall the schnictkl plants", whatever the heck that means. Are you in need of rescue? Surely, a dark red world like that must be dreary and boring compared to the happy world from whence your race evolved. BTW - that has also been a frequent subject of discussion of late - did you race evolve or travel to CDRodeffer? But our findings at Eden do sort of point to the correct answer. If your LRC is in need of rescue, I could dispatch a ship to help you. We're worried that you may be all but stuck in that uncomfortable place. We'll get cracking to get a ship built for a rescue mission...

28) Werebear: Trade B2 G2 Werebear
	CDRodeffer: I'm happy to hear your religious leaders are, well, having a nice day in the fields, what with your wonderful archeological work at Eden, despite the prophesized doom of your beloved schnictkl plants. I hope they're safe, and if you need us, we may soon be able to send a team of our crack gardners. In answer to your question, carvings on some of our ancient ruins seem to indicate that our distant ancestors traveled to the CDRodeffer system from somewhere else. And seeing that Eden is a garden planet, and we have many gardeners here, the travel theory seems quite possible.

29) CDRodeffer: Trade G1 Y1 Cdrodeffer
	Werebear: I thought... umm... that you didn't like those clunky bigger ships... don't they get just awful mileage?

30) Werebear: Build R3 Eden
	CDRodeffer: How true! How true! We have come to learn that certain high ranking members of the Little Red Corvette crew are actually disgruntled postal workers, and that they, and I quote, "are tired of being put down by 'the man'. We must rise up from this feudal oppression, overthrow the status-quo government and attain new heights of personal affluence." No wonder our mail has been late! So, we are in the process of sending out a (small) detachment of police officers (the police wear yellow here in CDRodeffer) to retrieve the renegade postal workers before they cause any harm, either to others or to themselves. If you encounter them, beware, and consider them "armed and dangerous." We don't anticipate any real problems, but you know, due to our long-standing mutual defense treaty, I thought it best you should know in advance, in case anything were to happen.

31) CDRodeffer: Trade G3 R3 Cdrodeffer
	Werebear: Did you hear about the bargain down at Ned's Used Space Ship Depot? Yep. Big Red ships. Granted they are a bit guady and all, but we think it goes well with the rest of our fleets, and reminds us fondly of our very first ship. Do you like it?
	CDRodeffer: Due to the news of those disgruntled postal workers hijacking a ship to some weird system in the far reaches of space (from us anyway), there has lately been a fad where everything must be red, and even the big wig politicians have succumbed to the crazy notion and given their production ship a paint job. I don't like it much, no, not at all. But what can I do? I can't control everyone.

32) Werebear: Move B1 Werebear Taxi

33) CDRodeffer: Trade Y1 G1 Cdrodeffer
	Werebear: CDRodeffer, old friend - it seems as if the postal worker situations has spiraled way out of control. Are you sure this doesn't have anything to do with the gift of Xcyactl that we gave you? Somehow, I feel responsible, like I've led your people astray with that temptation. On the other hand, maybe your people want your fleets to look a little like ours, perhaps? It might just be flattery, eh? 
	CDRodeffer: I assure you, the obsession with red is merely a passing fad, no more. But it has taken a huge toll on our productivity, in that people are thinking about red so much that they're no longer willing to work and build anything. To be sure, I'm in full agreement with that Shining sentiment, "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy." But the opposite is just as much cause for concern, "All play and no work makes Jack a starving boy." There are only so many things one can do to stave off both, so we're putting some of our welfare recipients to work giving that little yellow speedster a fresh green paint job. We hope the new color will contrast enough with that silly red fad to make people want to start working again.

34) Werebear: Move G2 Werebear Taxi
	Werebear: Well, no wonder your people are obsessed - they're watching the postal workers in that system that shan't be named day in and day out... and what an interesting view it is. See, even though it is two star-jumps for our people to get there, the system is actually pretty close, and our telescopes are letting us get crystal clear views of the shenanagans going on over in that un-named system. Do your religious leaders have any idea what is happening there? Wowza wowza wowza... We can't look away, some of us. I'm going to send out an Ecology Research Ship to Taxi to see if they can pick up any interesting readings from a bit closer, Star-Jump-Wise...

35) CDRodeffer: Construct G1 Cdrodeffer
	Werebear: Wow... much better view from here. Well, good grief. All work has been halted as all of our populations are consumed with watching your postal workers. Great. It's officially contagious. Well, I guess we'll just have to sip some Xcyactl and enjoy the show.

36) Werebear: Build B2 Eden
	CDRodeffer: Watching those whacky postal workers from afar is like some sort of strange situation comedy. But it has appeased the masses, and the people have started calming themselves and getting back to work. See, they even built a nice new green ship.

37) CDRodeffer: Discover G1 Cdrodeffer B3 The_berry_vest_of_the_swirling_eddies
	Werebear: Green is such a nice color. Hey, did you hear the one about the Postal Worker and the Ixmram Girl? That's the latest going around the old office here... While we really like Green, we're especially fond of Blue...
	CDRodeffer: I have not heard "that one." If you care to share, I'm sure we'd be delighted to hear the story. And Blue is OK. After all, one of our suns is Blue. And in fact, one of our scientists has just now observed an interesting new Blue giant that we'd like to explore. We're being much more cautious these days about who we allow into space, after that postal worker fiasco, so I'm sure there will be no problems this time.

38) Werebear: Move R2 Werebear The_berry_vest_of_the_swirling_eddies
	CDRodeffer: Off topic -- tonight my family and I are leaving town for a few days' vacation. We'll be back late on the 11th.
	Werebear: Blue... it looks so... blue... we're... our breath has been collectively taken away. It. Is. So. Beautiful. We must see it. We must Possess it. Precious blue.

39) CDRodeffer: Build G1 The_berry_vest_of_the_swirling_eddies

40) Werebear: Build B2 Taxi
	CDRodeffer: Possess? Here at CDRodeffer, we've always operated under the principle that no one can really "possess" something so great as a world, much less a star system. These are common areas, to be shared by everyone. So, I'm not sure I understand your intentions when you say "possess." But yes, it is a pretty blue. Upon that much, we are in full agreement.
	Werebear: Surely you can see why we love blue so much. It satisfies something deep inside of us. We want... more blue...

43) CDRodeffer: Build G2 Cdrodeffer
	CDRodeffer: Wow. That *is* a lot of blue. I think I'm going to have to go dig out my old pair of "Blue Blocker" sun glasses from 15 years ago, just to see clearly.

46) Werebear: Build G2 Taxi
	CDRodeffer: Ooh, shiny. Sorry I'm less than eloquent today, but it's been a very, VERY hectic day at work and at home.
	Werebear: Sorry to hear that - do you want to take a break for a few days? I'm not in a hurry, particularly...
	CDRodeffer: It's OK. These things are cyclical in my line of work -- goes for a while pretty light, then a heavy load of stuff. I can find time to squeeze in a turn now and then.

But hey, how goes your archeological research? Surely you must have some peaceful reason for having so many ships these days, seeing as how both matter and energy are so precious.
	Werebear: Oh, our research is going just great! In fact, hang on a moment, we'll show you some of the things we've found! First, a little "razzle-dazzle"...

	Werebear: I know we've been a bit greedy with our big ships - perhaps you'd like to help yourself to one or two of them? We won't mind at all... I'm so glad you won't mind if we borrow some, say, parking spaces from you for a while...
	CDRodeffer: Wow! That is impressive, indeed. Thanks for sending over those ships! I'm sure they'll come in handy.

	Werebear: Hey, you're only borrowing those, right? They are nice and roomy... but...   Hey - did you see our cool artifacts? They are stored in our pretty shiny red ship! Check 'em out... see?

	Werebear: Oh my. I think our postal workers went crazy! First they stole our original star cruiser, and then they crashed it - and then, heck, I don't know what happened! Umm... If I were you, I'd think about getting that little green ship of yours out of there. I think your postal workers must be in cahoots with our'n...
	CDRodeffer: Oh, man. Well. I think I'm going to ask our administrators to consider re-establishing a new home for the CDRodeffer population on The_Berry_Vest_of_the_Swirling_Eddies. They have great music there, dontcha know. Have you ever heard them? I especially like the song "Outdoor Elvis" from their second album and "Home Permanent" from their first.
	CDRodeffer: I can't see any other way out of our recent environmental disaster. The smog and polution from those large ships is choking our population. We've decided to go off to found a new "Home Permanent" at The_Berry_Vest_of_the_Swirling_Eddies.
	CDRodeffer: Ugg. It seems that the propulsion system on that small green ship isn't working properly, and it won't budge. If you can get it running, consider it a gift. Meanwhile, we're going to make do as best we can at our new home.

	Werebear: I think you may just have it pointed the wrong way - I'll turn it around and see if that helps...
