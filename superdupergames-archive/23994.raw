	wil: I thought we were in a blue/green race...  that I was losing, but I guess winning the blues was as dangerous as losing the greens?  it is interesting watching the eb and flow 

18) ts52: Trade B2 Y2 Robin
	wil: now I see the blue man group preparing for attack...
	ts52: Yeah, loosing the greens probably hurts me more. Oh well, it's fun to try different things...

19) wil: Build Y1 Gottadoit

20) ts52: Build B2 Robin
	wil: i have to eventually give you a green to get into blues myself..otherwise it looks like you will simply over power me with the larger pyramid sizes..

21) wil: Discover G2 Gottadoit R2 Ynot
	ts52: Not having a factory is really going to slow me down though. Maybe I should've given you the large green in order to have my own factory....

22) ts52: Build B2 Robin
	wil: yeah...so i hold off slowly growing while you slowly grow I just don't know....i think I should allow you the factory just so I can get into blue..

	wil: I was absolutely certain you had something going that I wasn't seeing!!   Thank you for the game.
	ts52: Dammit! Well played. I was watching for that a few moves ago, and then missed it anyway. Again?
	wil: Of course I'd like to play again...  learning the nuance here is incredible...
 
 
I thought you were gonna change your g3 last minute....or had something up your sleeve I couldn't see.   As I see it, I capitalized on the fact that you were singular in your homeworld, used the disguise of an investment (look at this big yellow ship I just got) to cover my placement of the green (rather than obviously move one forward) and that moving of the yellow ship in...  I was watching your blues but thought it was to my advantage for you to attack me as our homeworlds would be connected...I almost changed myg3 to a b3 just to entice you....  I am learning....thanx so much
	ts52: It's funny, because the reason I moved into your red systems was to try to capture your greens to keep you from doing what you did. I just missed the fact that you'd got up to 3 greens to kill me. Oops.
