	Jesse: I know I can save a turn by leaving them there.  I just feel better this way.
	mneme: You were winning sufficiently that I figured it was worth launching a suicide attack on the hope that you'd make a mistake -- thanks for the game! (You making Origins?)
	Jesse: I certainly can't blame you for launching a desperation attack.  I was in a fine position to squeeze you slowly out of the game.  It was a good game, thanks.
	Jesse: And yes, I do plan to attend Origins.  Do I know you?
	mneme: We've met.  Joshua Kronengold.  I made the Dicehouse set.
	Jesse: Ah, yes.  It's nice to make the connection between you and your SDG name.  See you at Origins!
	mneme: Heh.  I actually use "mneme" nearly everywhere (including my username on the lists).  And definitely.
