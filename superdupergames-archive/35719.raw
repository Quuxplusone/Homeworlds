	Babamots: I hadn't anticipated the blue sacrifice. That put me in a bit of a tight spot.
	Laurie_Menke: Sorry to be leaving Risa (I've heard it's quite a place for R&R!), but I've got some work to do over in Orion.  :)

	Babamots: When I looked at this position a bit, I noticed a danger for you that was a side-effect of my last move. Would you like to undo and pick a different move? Otherwise I'm afraid I'll be executing the infamous Bluebird maneuver.
	Laurie_Menke: Ack! You're right! You Bluebirded me! Well done... no, you won fair and square. Congratulations, Babamots! Thanks for the fun!  :)
	Laurie_Menke: Then again... you might not have me yet... let's just see where this takes us... I was thinking I was going to bluebird you in 2 moves. My problem is, I don't know whether I would have seen it coming and done the thing I'm about to do. So let's say you won but play it out with me trying this escape, OK?
	Laurie_Menke: Oh! It was your turn! Then all of that is moot... you definitely had me.  :)  Congrats!  :)
	Babamots: I've been Bluebirded myself, but I don't think I've ever been the Bluebirder. I'll cross that off my bucket list :-D.
 
Thanks for the game!
	Babamots: Sorry for the confusion; it was my turn, so you needed to undo to save yourself. I'm afraid I pulled the trigger as soon as I read your concession.
	Laurie_Menke: Makes sense, and congratulations! I actually got my "I Beat Andy" medal by Bluebirding him, but I don't count it because he was distracted because it was during an Andy vs. Everybody. I've never beat him since, so I haven't allowed myself to enjoy the medal until I beat him when he's concentrating. That said, I think I have him on the run in our current game, so maybe that'll be soon! Bucket list items for all!  :)  
	Babamots: Beating Andy is high on my bucket list. If I can get to the DC area this summer, maybe I can catch him for a showdown at high noon.
	Laurie_Menke: He would love that!  :)
