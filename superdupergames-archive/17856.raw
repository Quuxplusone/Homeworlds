39) Remneb: Discover R1 Remneb Y3 Alderan
	SilentTitan: ok... I thought you might be a beginner.  we should start again or at the very least you should take back your last turn, because if there is ever four of the same color in a system either player can call for a catasrophe and that will destroy all the items of that color in that system. In this case you just created the forth red item in your home system. 
 

	Remneb: Well i did not include the star...yes i'm a beginner...the only games that i played to the finish was the two that i lost against Ts52.

40) SilentTitan: Sacrifice G3 Redstar

47) Remneb: Build Y2 Remneb
	Remneb: I think you have a lot of fun :)
	Remneb: In a system with a red star,do every ships in that system are capable of attacking because they are in a red system?

48) SilentTitan: Sacrifice G3 Silenttitan
Build Y2 Rooky
Build Y2 Remagen
Build R1 Alderan
	SilentTitan: Yes. think of the color of the pieces as technology red=attack tech; blue=trade tech; yellow=move tech and green=build tech. In the case of ships only your pieces can use the tech, but in the case of planets the whole system gets to use the tech, no matter who is in the system.

49) Remneb: Sacrifice Y2 Remneb
Move R3 Remneb Omaha
Move R3 Omaha Greenstar
	SilentTitan: also as you can see here I can sacrifice a piece to have that tech where ever I need it to be. In this case I sacrificed a 3-pip red so I got to execute three attack actions. and I took three of your ships because in each system I had a ship that was as big or bigger. 
	Remneb: Understand.Also,i saw along the game that you sacrifice a g3 to create 3 other ships.If you sacrifice a b3,you also can build 3 other ships?

50) SilentTitan: Sacrifice Y3 Greenstar
Move B3 Alderan Remneb
Move B3 Rooky Remneb
Move B2 Remagen Remneb
Catastrophe Remneb Blue
	Remneb: I never been able by the game system to build a blew ship.I have a blew star in my Homeworld.I know that i need to have a ship of the same color already in position in the system where i want a blew ship.The blew star is apparently not enough to build a blew ship.
	SilentTitan: correct including you can rebuild the g3 you just sacrificed as long as it's avaliable in the bank. Say there is a g2 and a g3 in the bank and on your turn you sacrifice a g3 you can then build a g2 then build a g3 then build another g3 which is the g3 that was returned to the bank when you sacrificed it at the beginning of your turn. the only requirement is that you have to have a green ship in the system your going to build green ships. Same with the blue ships.  A star give you that tech (ie a blue star gives trade tech) but in order to build blue ships you have to already have a blue ship.
	SilentTitan: at this point you would have to trade one of your existing ships for a blue ship, which you are unable to do because either I have them all, or they are planets. Having a monopoly on one of the colors is a one of the easiest ways to win the game.  If you can deny the other player on of the techs then that gives you a very distinct advantage.


51) Remneb: Sacrifice Y1 Remneb
Move R3 Greenstar Silenttitan
	Remneb: That's the orders i gave:sacrifice y2 Remneb 
move r3 Remneb Rooky
attack b3 Rooky...but the system told me that i have no more actions.What is wrong in my orders ?

52) SilentTitan: Sacrifice Y2 Remagen
Move Y2 Rooky Remneb
Move B1 Greenstar Silenttitan

53) Remneb: Attack Y2 Remneb
	SilentTitan: you can only do one type of action a turn .. so you cannot move and attack or trade and move or build and attack etc.... since you sacked a y2 you had to either do two moves or one move and a pass
	SilentTitan: The problem you have with the move you've made here is that I can sacrifice either of the r1's in Alderan which gives me 1 attack action I can take anywhere on the board. I can use that attack action combined with my Y3 in greenstar to take your R3 that you just moved in. Like so

54) SilentTitan: Trade B1 R1 Silenttitan

55) Remneb: Attack B2 Silenttitan
	SilentTitan: but instead...  I will move three of my blue ships into your homeworld and catastrophe the blue
	SilentTitan: I want to keep mentioning to you... that you can only use the stars or your own ships in a system for the technology. In the case of system GreenStar now... you can only attack or build in that system you cannot trade or move (unless you sacrifice a blue or yellow somewhere else on the board) because you only have a red (attack) ship and the star is green (build).  you cannont trade in Greenstar because the blue ship is nime and therefore the technology is not yours. Is this making sense? If you do an attack option and capture my blue ship then you would be able to trade the turn after that. the command to attack my blue ship is "attack b1 greenstar south" you have to add the south part to this command so it knows who you are attacking ... while this doesn't make sense in the two player game ... it does in the four player game. 

56) SilentTitan: Move R1 Alderan Remneb
	Remneb: My target was your b2 in your Homeworld.
	Remneb: There's a lot of things to keep in mind when playing that game.I'm going-with your permission-copy all your comments for further studying.I found nothing on the net about the tactical aspect of Homeworlds.

57) Remneb: Trade B2 R2 Silenttitan
Catastrophe Silenttitan R
	SilentTitan: Whoops... you're right.  Nice Job! I got so caught up in teaching that I wasn't watching out. Did you want to play again?
	Remneb: Yes of course.I surely need more training.

	SilentTitan: Good Game!! Nice Job at the end ... there were some puzzles there you had to figure out. 
	SilentTitan: Yeah.... I'll tell my brother-in-law... that kind of thing is right up his alley
	SilentTitan: oops I probably should have this practice game be rated... heh
	Remneb: I think that you can be a good teacher also...since i don't know who is your brother-in-law.
	Remneb: Gosh! I tough it was not a rated game.
	Remneb: Let's play again.I will challenge you for a rated game.No help this time.I should be stunt in a few moves :)
	SilentTitan: ah... yes of course .. my bro-in-law is in position 2 on the ladder dlwillson.
	Remneb: He's playing a game against TwoShort for the 2000 rating :)
