20) TeeTeeTee: Build Y3 Teeteetee

	TeeTeeTee: Yeah, I think that this one was my game from as soon as I took the last y1. A possible stalling move would have been to discover a g3 as soon as I sacrificed by g3: this would have also have stopped you from being able to sacrifice your own g3, but would have certainly slowed me down too.
 
You've made this mistake before! The first seven moves we each played in this game were identical to this one: http://superdupergames.org/main.html?page=archive_play&gid=26272 - I tried to monopolise yellow, you tried to monopolise blue, but choosing the colour with fewer medium pyramids in the stash gave me the advantage.
 
Thanks for the game. Feel free to re-challenge me, as this one was quite brief.
	wil: Yeah..story of my life making the same mistakes over and over...  I'ma gonna wait and see if you get a real challenger, if not, I'll step back in as a sparring partner and hope to give you a little run for your money...
	TeeTeeTee: I think you're a little harsh on yourself, here. You've played stronger games and weaker games: I thought that the previous game we played could have gone either way right up until near the the end. The other relatively recent game we played (#26038) was close, and I felt that I was lucky to win that one. It does feel like games are decided on just one or two errors these days, though...
