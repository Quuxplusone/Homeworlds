Participants: ts52 (S), TeeTeeTee (N), wil (E)
Winner: TeeTeeTee

1) TeeTeeTee: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3

2) wil: Homeworld G3 B1 B3 *
	TeeTeeTee: Shall we have another try at a multiplayer game, then?
	wil: Heck...you think we'll complete one??  Maybe with you two!  Now convention says we each create a different homeworld yes?   I suppose I'll take fortress....

3) ts52: Homeworld Y2 B3 G3

4) TeeTeeTee: Build G1 Teeteetee
	ts52: Wow, I can't remember the last time I played Homeworlds with more than one opponent. This should be fun.

5) wil: Build B1 Wil
	TeeTeeTee: I've not played a game with more than two players before, with the exception of one that lasted for only a few days before two players dropped out. We've got a good chance of this one playing out, though... 
	wil: I've yet to complete one... I think binary is still the best...but these do lead to a binary game with lots of pieces once one is eliminated...I just haven't got that far with one yet...

6) ts52: Build G1 Ts52
	wil: I meant to take fortress and instead to goldilocks and just noticed...  And you TTT sure rallied up the ladder!!

15) ts52: Trade G1 Y1 Ts52
	TeeTeeTee: Okay - feel free to set up another 3-player challenge, then, wil (or ts52). Perhaps you two should agree to team up, this time?
	wil: oops...what the hell did i do?  did I overload myself??...I did I did...foolishness!
	wil: oops...what the hell did i do?  did I overload myself??...I did I did...foolishness!
	TeeTeeTee: Yeah... I have to say, you each made terrible blunders in Homeworlds games yesterday. (ts52: can you see what you should have done here, instead of sacrificing the r1? http://superdupergames.org/?page=archive_play&gid=25745&idx=60 )
 
Also, wil, did you ever follow through with your plan to discuss/comment on interesting Homeworlds games?
	ts52: TTT: I missed the yellow you had one move away from my homeworld. So sacrificing the r1 was a complete waste. 

16) TeeTeeTee: Trade G1 R1 Teeteetee
	ts52: TTT: Er, sorry, wasn't your yellow, but the rest is the same.

	wil: Yeah, we only got a few suggestions...but we are going to do it..
	TeeTeeTee: Great! I'd certainly be interested in seeing what you come up with. If you'd like, then I could offer some suggestions for games? Alternatively, if you've already chosen some games, then I could offer my own comments on them? Send me a private message if you're interested.
	wil: send me suggestions...  The suggestions I am asking for are ones from players that got whipped by something they didn't see coming...or perfect examples of setting up a doomsday machine or taking advantage of a bluebird, or cornering an economy.... teachable moments for those learning.

	ts52: It's funny, I should've seen that coming, since you just did it to me a turn ago. Sigh.

40) TeeTeeTee: Move Y2 Teeteetee Duvel

41) ts52: Build G1 Ts52
	TeeTeeTee: Actually, I think I made an error, there: the stronger move for me would have been to build a single g1 at Oscar. If you took both g1s by sacrificing the r2, then I could move in the g2 to cause a catastrophe, and we'd have both lost a medium ship; otherwise, I'd have built a g1, and we'd have both kept our medium ships. Oh well - guess it makes the game more interesting!
