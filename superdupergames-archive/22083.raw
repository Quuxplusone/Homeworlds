	Krooze: Ah, so you CAN take a larger ship with a smaller ship's sacrifice.  I must have been inputting the command incorrectly when I tried.  Really wish the UI was more streamlined.
	Krooze: I apologize, but I can't seem to figure this out.  What command would I type to sacrifice my r1 to take your g3?
	Krooze: Aaaaaah, I think I get it now.  You could only attack my r3 because of your g3.  This is my first game, as you can tell.
	Krooze: Thanks for an educational game.  I hope to play you again.
	SilentTitan: Actually, you played so well.. that I had no idea this was your first game.  Truly that is a raity. had I known this was your first game, I would have given you the option of pulling back the R3 once you failed to do so. 
 
You may challenge me again via my standing challenge.  That is 90% of the reason it is there 
	Krooze: Thanks for the kind words!  I'll be sure to challenge you again soon.  I enjoyed the game a lot.
 
My secret (if you can call it that) is having physical pieces set up at home, so I can rearrange the worlds in a way that makes more sense to me spatially.  If I'd been relying solely on the graphic representation here, I would have been lost.  Besides, having pieces set up makes a game (any game) feel more "real" to me.
 
For that reason, I'm limited to one game at a time, at least until I get more comfortable with the game.  Currently playing against ts52, and I'll hopefully be a more worthy opponent next time we meet.
