22) Mitotic: Build B1 Phlegmnation
	Mitotic: The move I undid. I move my r3 to phlegmnation and then you could have made another red ship and gotten rid of my 3 ship this early in the game.
On second thought, it wasn't *that* bad a move, but it was still kinda bad.

	GalateanGemmate: dang I forgot about how the attack mechanics work
I was trying to defend against a really terrifying attack earlier on when you sent your blues after me
but then I realized you couldn't do it
and now I was about to do the same thing

47) GalateanGemmate: Sacrifice R3 Galateangemmate
Attack R2 Mitotic
Attack R1 Mitotic
Attack B1 Mitotic
	Mitotic: I just glanced at a strategy guide and one of the first things it said was to not copy the sizes of your opponents stars bc then you'll be too close and it is too hard to defend with only one buffer star in between unless I had some amazing strategy for blitzing you.
Which I don't
	GalateanGemmate: oh! btw here's a strategy link
I think I read it a long time ago, before I even had the game
http://icehousegames.org/wiki/index.php?title=Homeworlds_strategy
	GalateanGemmate: oh hey you found a strategy guide! probably the one I just gave you!
	GalateanGemmate: yeah I think it might just highlight the turn advantage player 1 gets

48) Mitotic: Build G1 Mitotic

49) GalateanGemmate: Sacrifice R2 Mitotic
Attack G1 Mitotic
Attack G1 Mitotic
	Mitotic: yeah it is the same strategy guide I was looking at <3

	Mitotic: I forgot how attacking works (and that the y2 you had made it so you could take my r2), but even if I had remembered, I wouldn't have realized that you could, or even would, do that. Good move!
	GalateanGemmate: thanks! the reason I figured it out is that I was *really* worried about you doing it earlier
	GalateanGemmate: oops! I didn't mean to make that a rated game!
	GalateanGemmate: I mean IDK if it matters
	GalateanGemmate: and yeah attacking is p confusing
	Mitotic: GG GGG
	GalateanGemmate: yes! that was a good game! I think you're p close to beating me!
