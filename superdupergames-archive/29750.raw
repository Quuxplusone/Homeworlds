	Felix: :(
	ts52: Dammit! Got distracted and forgot about my SDG games again. Sorry Felix.
	Felix: That's okay. I just hate that you had to lose that way, and on a ladder game no less! I've already been challenged by someone else but I hope you'll challenge me again in future, and I'd love to just plat a non-ladder game in the meantime!
	Draw5PlayAll: And the ts52 system is now in the main grid... odd...
	ts52: No worries, it's my own fault.
	Draw5PlayAll: Felix: you were clearly winning. How were you going to try to finish ts52 off?
All: Why do you suppose the ts52 system drifted into the middle of the field with all the other systems?
	ts52: Draw5PlayAll: That's just what happens when someone loses. SDG no longer thinks ts52 is a homeworld, so it doesn't treat it special any more.
	ts52: fwiw I Would've factoried g2 at zoe and maraud, probably.
	Felix: I didn't quite have a concrete finishing him off plan in place yet, but my plan was to just keep trying to dominate the blue market while continuing to rebuild that b3 and trade it, scooping up the rest of the larges and giving myself plenty of forces and options. I think I would have just positioned my blue and yellow ships and then sacrificed some y3s to move them into place and catastrophe his homeworld. Jury's out on whether it would work though. Ts52 has upset my plans before when I thought I was winning!
	ts52: :)
