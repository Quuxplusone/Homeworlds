Since there were 4 units of one color, I had the opportunity, the opportunity, the duty (some might say) to declare a catastrophe, destroying all Green in the system. I tried not to, I swear.

I'm looking for ways to better visualize the game. My setup often has errors, ooops, how did that ship get *there*? For now, you should build paper pyramids, perhaps that will distract you.
