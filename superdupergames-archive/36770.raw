	Babamots: I think I can come back from this if I can keep a hold of the yellow economy.

29) Layana: Build G2 Layana
	Layana: Was it a mistake to attack so soon? 

30) Babamots: Discover Y2 Orion B2 Bolarus
	Babamots: I think it was a mistake to attack so soon. You got one of my stars, but you used to have the advantage in color diversity and material. I've got a pretty big material advantage now, though it's easier for you to diversify. I'll need to discover a blue star before I have any ships besides yellow.
	Layana: You're right. I can't trade for y3, because you'd just Catastrophe my homeworld. That basically shuts me out of yellow. 
	Layana: How would you have played this, then? I feel like whenever I get some sort of material advantage, there is always a threat of Catastrophe to take that away. I guess I need to spread out my forces me, but that feels like I'm losing tempo every time. 

31) Layana: Discover G2 Layana B1 Qonos
	Babamots: Here's a link to the position before the invasion:
 
http://www.superdupergames.org/?page=archive_play&gid=36770&idx=21
 
Here's my analysis of that position.
 
* You're up a small ship and a color.
 
* I can't work on getting blue, so you're safe from blue catastrophe.
 
* You don't have red yet, but neither do I, so you're safe from invasion for now.
 
* The advantage I see for me is my strength in the yellow economy: lots of ships, nicely spread out. Once we use up a few more yellows I'm ready to do a g3 sacrifice and at least one large yellow build (a chameleon factory). In the real game, this is what I'm trying to take advantage of.
 
* You're in a good position to start getting red: you trade one of your blues (no loss of diversity since you still have blue). For me, getting red safely is at least a three turn thing. I need to build a ship (yellow or green) at home (so I don't have to trade away my only yellow there), then trade the new ship for red, then move the red out of my home to avoid the danger of overpopulation. By then you could actually have two red ships and be ready to do a catastrophe on me.
 
* I think pressing your red-potential advantage is how you win from here.
1) Trade b1 for r1
2) build another red (to make it hard for me to get red without risking catastrophe at home),
3) build yellow
4) move yellow to a new system (so you're better prepared to build yellow when/if I open up larges),
5) build more blue and red to prepare to destroy my stars.


32) Babamots: Build Y3 Orion
	Babamots: Right now, you need to worry about getting totally locked out of yellow. With no yellow, you can't reach my home and the best you can hope for is a draw. (SDG doesn't actually allow draws, but the game could stall if you can't reach me but I don't have enough material to end you). My fear is that you'll manage to get another g3, and trade that g3 for y3.
 
I'm now scrambling to diversify my fleet and keep it spread out. I don't want you to get red and catch several of my ships vulnerable before I can get red.
 
You can see that I've moved a y2 to a blue system, so I'm planning to trade it for another color. You you'll want to trade g2 for y2 once I free up the piece. I think you should discover a b1 system with your g2 so that you can get the y2 without the danger of overpopulation in your home.

33) Layana: Build G2 Layana
	Layana: So is it true that a homeworld with a yellow star is easier to attack via Catastrophe than other homeworlds? After all, you need yellow to move and setup a Catastrophe, so in the case of a yellow homeworld star, you don't really have to be that diverse. And I feel you basically need some yellow no matter what you are going for. 
	Babamots: I actually think the opposite: causing a catastrophe against a yellow star seems a little harder than against other colors, especially if you want to knock out both stars quickly. Think about the material you need to quickly knock out a blue-yellow home:
 
* Three blue ships to trigger a blue star catastrophe
* Three yellow ships to trigger a yellow star catastrophe
* Two yellows to sacrifice
* A ship occupying your home, of course
 
Those Five yellow ships need to be spread across at least three systems to keep from having a three-concentration. Each of those systems will probably need a large ship defending it. That's a lot of infrastructure.
 
For another thing, of the nine yellow pieces, one is a home star and five are your ships. There are only three yellows to spare. If there are just four yellows tied up as enemy ships or stars, then there aren't enough pieces for your Doomsday machine.
 
If that home star were red instead, then the ships you need are more diverse (three red, three blue, two yellow). You need a little of everything, but you don't need to dominate any one economy. And all of those ships can safely fit in just two systems with a maximum color-concentration of two in any system. It seems to me that this is usually easier.
	Babamots: But I take red home stars anyway so that I can safely build more yellow at home.

34) Babamots: Discover Y3 Orion B3 Betazed

35) Layana: Trade G2 R2 Layana
	Layana: Yes, that makes sense. But if you attack the opponent in two waves, then you wouldn't need that many ships at once, surely? 
	Layana: Yes, that makes sense. But if you attack the opponent in two waves, then you wouldn't need that many ships at once, surely? 
	Layana: One more question : with my current lead in green, I should be able to get most of the blue ships, right? Would that not be preferable to trying to go into red? As a defensive play? 
	Babamots: You're right, if you're comfortable launching your attack in two waves, then you don't need as much yellow all at once. After the first phase, you may be able to build a yellow to complete the second phase (if your opponent doesn't beat you to it). Every turn that takes place between the phases increases the danger.
 
And sometimes it's easier to run away with a lead in the yellow economy than it is to diversify, in which case you'll have no trouble destroying a yellow star.
 
I've made my argument for yellow stars being good for defense, but it's mostly theory and gut feeling. I guess the best answer would be to look at all the HW games on SDG and see if yellow stars are more or less likely to be destroyed. I might look into collecting that data, but in the meantime, it's OK if we don't agree :-).
	Babamots: I think you're better off getting some red before you worry about blue here. (The best defense is a good offense, as they say.) Getting a red will put pressure on me to get red, which may help to free up yellow pieces for you. Also you'll need red to destroy my other star.
 
I'm trying hard not to let you get yellow. In order to catastrophe a red star, you absolutely need at least a y2 to sacrifice (if you move red ships to my home one at a time, I'll capture them while sacrificing the ones I captured on previous turns.)
 
Since my last turn, I've changed my mind about what I should do next. I was planning to trade my y2 for r2, but really don't want to let you get a y2, so I'm looking at a couple of other options.

36) Babamots: Trade Y3 G3 Betazed

37) Layana: Move R2 Layana Ferenginar

38) Babamots: Sacrifice Y2 Ferenginar
Discover Y1 Ferenginar Y2 Iconia
Discover Y2 Bolarus Y3 Aldea

39) Layana: Trade G1 B1 Layana

40) Babamots: Move Y1 Orion Betazed
	Babamots: Hmm, now that you have a red, you're prepared to take advantage of any weak systems that I open up to you. I think I've got to go full boa constrictor here and keep you from getting any yellow, whatever the cost. I'm going to build up a victory fleet where you can't bother me.
 
I'm theorizing here, but I think your next objective needs to be using up all of the small pieces (mostly as ships) so that, assuming I amass a victory fleet, I won't have a way to get it to your home. Using up the rest of the greens will give you a factory to build faster (although it will give me a chance to get another g3 and a factory as well).

41) Layana: Build G1 Layana
	Layana: It seems nontrivial to actually get those green ships without risking my g3, though :) 

42) Babamots: Build G1 Betazed

43) Layana: Build G2 Qonos

44) Babamots: Trade G1 B1 Betazed
	Babamots: You say "nontrivial" like a mathematician. Do you consider yourself one?

45) Layana: Sacrifice G2 Qonos
Build G1 Qonos
Build R1 Ferenginar
	Layana: I have a Ph.d. in pure mathematics, somewhere between category theory, algebra, topology and logic (at bit of all of that, I suppose). I work half-time at the "Institut Analysis and Algebra" of Technische Universität Braunschweig. But I also work in automotive industry...
	Layana: What about you?

46) Babamots: Build B2 Betazed
	Babamots: I'm an applied math PhD student. I'm working in numerical linear algebra and control problems.
	Layana: I have a phd student who is working on control theory, too. Some people seem to like their categories of topological monoid actions... 

47) Layana: Trade G2 B2 Qonos
	Babamots: I know what a topology is, not too sure about the other parts. :-D

48) Babamots: Build G2 Betazed

49) Layana: Build G2 Qonos

50) Babamots: Discover G3 Betazed R1 Romulus

	Babamots: Just realized I should be able to go the whole game without any red ships this way.
	Layana: Yes, this is like super over. Thanks for the game :) are you fine continuing our games, even if they aren't challenging to you? Can we maybe try a game where you start with only one star (so that I can see what that is like)? 
	Babamots: I'm having a good time. I'm winning, aren't I? :-D
 
Are you suggesting that we both start with one star, or just me? SDG doesn't actually let you start with only one star, but we could deliberately cause catastrophes in the first few moves.
	Layana: Well, easy wins tend to become boring after a while, don't they? And yes, I meant just you.
