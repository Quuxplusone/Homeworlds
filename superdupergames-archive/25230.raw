	Marmalade: Not much in the way of snow here (it's getting close), but do have to worry about flooding :/
	fogus: Huh... I didn't know that you could attack even without a ship in the same system.  :-( I'm still learning how to best utilize sacrifices, this is a painful way to learn. ;-)

	fogus: And of course as I said that I almost walked right into a catastrophe myself.

20) fogus: Build G1 Fogus

28) fogus: Discover Y1 Fogus R3 Caprica

	fogus: D'oh!
	fogus: As thus did the last of humanity flee the fogus system in search of a new home... verily did they find after much toil, a 4-star cluster suitable for habitation.  After much deliberation their new home was named Caprica.  Little is known of what happened to those survivors.
	Marmalade: Aw, poor little triangular guys. It's amazing, considering that they're only difference is pointing in different directions, that they can't get on.
 
Cheers for the game.

	fogus: Thank you for the game.  My apologies for not putting up a very strong fight. I hope to get there one day.
