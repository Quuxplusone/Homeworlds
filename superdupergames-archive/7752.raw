Attack R3S Aph
	mneme: Er.  Is the syntax for attacking in multiplayer Homeworlds documented -anywhere-?  I had to basically guess until i figured it out ("a r2s zpm", in this case.
	MikeYarrum: It's hidden in the fine print below the list of recognized commands.

78) zoltar: Move G3 Greenpea Zoltar

79) stoneaxe: Build R1 Stoneaxe

Catastrophe Stoneaxe R

83) stoneaxe: Build Y3 Stoneaxe
	stoneaxe: Is there a TV series called "Clueless"?  Because thats what I am in this game.
	zoltar: If you're wondering why I retreated my G3 to my homeworld instead of the obvious move of moving it into your homeworld, where you are on the brink of catastrophe and blowing up your green star, it's because I'm already behind and losing a 3-pip ship would leave me really weak.  I figure it's better to lay low with a safe G3-R3 castle (after I move out my blue ship) and let someone else blow up your stars, rather than make myself a target by getting weaker.
	zoltar: The game will be over soon anyway, as I'm pretty much dead.

84) MikeYarrum: Move R2 Mikeyarrum Tomo

85) mneme: Move G3 Saph Zpm
	mneme: Zoltar: I'm not sure.  I've got a hefty advantage over you, but I'm not seeing a good way to finish you off quickly, especially with your castling up.
	mneme: And Yarrum probably -can- make a doomsday device that will take me out, given time.
	mneme: Oh, stoneaxe, if you're wondering why I targetted your stuff when it was Zoltar who's my "prey", it was an attack of opportunity.  I needed more material that was one step away from Zoltar's homeworld, and your stuff was convenienty situated and unprotected.
	zoltar: Since my yellow star is toast, I had to protect my homeworld I figure, but as soon as you get any blue ships I'm toast.
	zoltar: Well, the best I can do is to help Mike blow some of your stuff up, as it helps him and saves me...

86) zoltar: Sacrifice R3 Zoltar
Attack G2S Stoneaxe
Attack G2S Stoneaxe
Attack Y3S Stoneaxe
	zoltar: on second thought, maybe I'm being too defensive...

87) stoneaxe: Trade Y3 R3 Stoneaxe
	zoltar: Now that I'm castled, I'm going on a mad all-out attack, as I don't have the time to wait while either Mike or Mneme builds a doomsday device. Prepare for battle!
	mneme: Very nice.  I'm trying to figure out how to effect a rescue, and not seeing a good one.  Mike, any ideas?
 
I think this is a case where the person to the left of the weakest player has a sizable advantage.

	zoltar: Yep, I didn't see that move until I'd made the other one attacking mneme, and that I could take a red ship from both greenbean and greenpea, so that neither of you could ram the other with 2 red ships this turn, leaving my red fleet maximally dispersed and intact.  I went from thinking I was worst off to being best off, all because stoneaxe made a crazy move and set himself up for catastrophe.
	mneme: Pretty much.  By "counter" attacking me, he gave away nearly all his red.  
 
And mike's the only one who even -owns- enough blue to take out your invasion fleet, and it's not even close to positioned right for that. :(
	MikeYarrum: Aside from hitting mneme's homeworld (which would weaken me quite a bit), I'm out of ideas.
	zoltar: Then the Galaxy will be mine! All mine! [Insert Evil Overlord Laughter here]

88) MikeYarrum: Sacrifice Y2 Yomi
Move R2 Tomo Greenbean

	zoltar: Pray pear two meat yore DOOM, hyu-maahn beanz!
	mneme: Hmm.  Ok, I see a way out.  Stoneaxe, swap your large for a red.
Mike, if you put two reds in greenbean, I'll put another one in for the party.

	zoltar: Reziztanz ease few tile.
	zoltar: Yes, you can buy yourselves one more turn, in which you can pray to your respective deities for a better afterlife...

92) MikeYarrum: Sacrifice B1 Nyamo
Trade R3 Y3 Yomi

93) mneme: Move R3 Aph Zoltar
	mneme: Oh, two more turns at least.

94) zoltar: Sacrifice G2 Stoneaxe
Build B1 Zoltar
Build B2 Zoltar
	zoltar: Yep, that was the way to do it.  I'm toast.  Well, it was worth a try.  Good game.

95) stoneaxe: Attack Y3E Stoneaxe

96) MikeYarrum: Build R1 Mikeyarrum
	zoltar: Well, stoneaxe, your only way out is to capture one of my green and leave my red and yellow, and then cause a catastrophe in my homeworld at the end of your turn.  Then Mike will have to move a blue ship into my homeworld, so that on my turn I can sac my Y3 and bring my B3 and B1 back into my homeworld and destroy them.  Only way you can stop  mneme from winning next turn, after he moves another ship in.
	mneme: I'm honestly not sure how that would help -- the described catastrophe would depopulate your homeworld, zoltar, wouldn't it?
	zoltar: Well, yes, but it would stop you from instantly winning the game.
	mneme: Ah -- "eliminating a player to your left or across from you does not end the game or give someone else the victory".  Doesn't say anything about suicide, mind.  Mind, I'm not sure this -should- be true -- I think the game's probably more elegant if -anything- eliminating a player will cause the player to their right to win, thus avoiding "you can't kill him; I'll do it after you've weakened him!" nonsense.
	zoltar: Well, in any case, the 4 player version is 'broken' because of situations like this, where Mike got to be 'KingMaker' and choose whether you or I win.  I thought I had enough reds to force the issue but I did not.  So here perhaps I can commit suicide without your getting the victory, just to make it less then a binary choice.  I don't like the sinister version because of this.  The two player game is great, except that the good players always kick my butt and I kick everyone else's butt so I'm in this limbo in terms of strength.  Well, maybe with more players when the game catches on, that gap will close...
	MikeYarrum: It took me a few games to realize why the "standard" Homeworlds has Good and Evil alignments, though there was enough politics going on when I played it IRL with my friends.
	zoltar: What's IRL? I've never heard of it.
	MikeYarrum: In Real Life. Like, with the plastic pyramids.
	zoltar: Ahhh, "Real Life" -- oh I get it now.  That's something like Plato's heaven of ideal forms, isn't it, compared to which this is just a play of shadows, eh?
	MikeYarrum: Something like that. Brad kept taking the last pyramids of smallest size, so Matt easily took the lead, having first chance at all the 2 and 3 pointers. But it wasn't all bad - Brad ended up saving my butt when he wiped out Matt's doomsday machine for no other reason than he could.
	mneme: Zoltar: I don't know; we seem to be reasonably evenly matched in two player -- and unlike me, you've actually beaten TwoShort.  I don't know about "broken" -- you over-extended to hit stoneaxe, (a little) but in theory, people could do a lot of detent to force a situation where a player was going to die and nobody could stop it.
	zoltar: That's true, we're fairly evenly matched, but it's rare that I have an even game.  As for 4 player, any time someone is about to win the others can swoop in and attack him, so it's hard to see how the game can be as interesting.
	stoneaxe: This is (was?) my first game of this, so I am a little overwhelmed/confused.  I think I will just do this and see how it all works out.  Maybe next time I'll understand what the heck is goin on a little sooner-???

97) mneme: Sacrifice R3 Zpm
Attack B2E Zoltar
Attack B2E Zoltar
Attack B1E Zoltar

	mneme: *blink*.  I take it nobody else could create the catastrophe either?  Good game, everyone.
	zoltar: Or were the two of you asleep and simply forgot to type "c zoltar b" at the end of your turns (in which case mneme deserves the win)!?
	mneme: I...was wondering about that.  I think I deserve the win anyway, given that you'd have needed a suicide to stop it.  But the mind boggles.  I went for the attack win rather than the "c zoltar b" win because it seemed classier, of course.
	mneme: It's possible that the game prevents you from killing other players who aren't your prey -- which makes huge amounts of sense, if so, but should be spelled out in the rules in that case.

	zoltar: I really think that the game only prevents a player from ending a turn with none of the player's ships in that player's homeworld, and that's all, and that anyone else can cause a catastrophe anywhere except in their own homeworld  if none of there own ships are left there.
	MikeYarrum: I wasn't paying enough attention, sorry.
 
But on another note, we would have also had to deal with mneme's big ol' warship in the zoltar system. Could that have also given mneme the win, even if he didn't directly eliminate zoltar?
	zoltar: no, it would not have.
