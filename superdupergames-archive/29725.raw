Homeworlds Online (SDG# 29725)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2016.5.15, Ended: 2016.5.26
Participants: Draw5PlayAll (S), Felix (N)
Winner: Felix

1) Felix: Homeworld B3 R2 G3
	Felix: Welcome! First game? Hope you enjoy and let me know if you have any questions!

2) Draw5PlayAll: Homeworld B1 R2 G3

3) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: Here's what I think is going to happen.
We each will build a G1 and then either build another green or trade for something (probably yellow).
	Felix: That sounds pretty accurate to me. The beginnings of games are usually pretty similar.

4) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: Hold it. How do I construct ships in the home world? Do I write `build G1 Draw5PlayAll` or `build G1 homeworld` or `build G1 S`?

5) Felix: Trade G1 Y1 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: Figured it out from the system message "North created a G1 ship in the Felix system".
	Felix: Glad you figured it out! You also don't have to write out the whole word for an action. You can just type "B G1 Draw5PlayAll" instead of "Build G1 ...."

6) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: Despite several doubts we are going to attempt to build another small construction ship. As no enemies are in range of a suicide attack, we are safe for the time being.
 

 
I have a question. Suppose you have a green and a Y3 in your base while I have three greens. If you sac the Y3 to fly your green into my home and call catastrophe, who wins? Or is it a draw?

7) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	Felix: Before we venture forth on a discovery mission, we would also like to increase the construction capacity of our system by building a new small construction ship.
 
- - - - -
 
I think in an offline game it would be considered a draw if that situation came up. If there are no ships left in MY homeworld at the end of my turn, I would also lose. The system here on SDG, however, doesn't allow you to fully abandon your homeworld like that. The move is impossible on here, so it couldn't happen that way. That's just how the game is programmed here.

8) Draw5PlayAll: Trade G1 Y1 Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: By popular request, we have decided to implement warp drive on one of our small ships. Unfortunately we had to remove its construction capabilities to do so. We've been trying for years to fit two abilities into one ship but it is simply impossible.

9) Felix: Trade G1 B1 Felix

10) Draw5PlayAll: Discover G1 Draw5playall R3 Dangerzone
	Felix: My people, meanwhile, have been demanding that we expand our trade market, so we have retrofitted one of our construction vessels with trade technology. We hope to venture forth into the unknown soon in search of peaceful people with which to trade.

11) Felix: Build B1 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: A lone green ventured out into space and found a huge red planet. The people there had many weapons, but surprisingly the green was undetected in orbit. That's what I'm told at least.
	Felix: The people are pleased with the new trade regime and demand its further expansion. We complied by building yet another trade vessel. The technology powering our trade vessels is also found in the core of the larger of our two home planets, so we must send out one of our trade vessels soon to avoid any natural catastrophes occurring by overtaxing the planet's reactor.

12) Draw5PlayAll: Build Y1 Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: We got a little annoyed by your actions and decided to construct another ship, this time with warp drives from the beginning.  We fear your later actions and are trying to access more planets to diversify and spread out our fleet.
 
Be aware that if you upsize your movement vessels, we many launch suicide ships to destroy your warp drive.

13) Felix: Discover B1 Felix G1 Littlewood
	Draw5PlayAll: Incidentally, I saw your 4P challenge. I'm a bit hesitant because that forces either two people to share a homeworld size (causing them to fight bitterly in LCS; not as bad in Sinister) or someone to choose a "Gemini" star (1-1, 2-2, or 3-3) which also creates bitter fighting. (I think a gemini is an awful choice for any battle.)
 
I think they should add a 2v2 mode for four players. I've hypothesized about how this might work (the teams obviously should pick the same size stars). Not sure if partners should go sequentially (1,2 vs 3,4) or not (1,3 vs 2,4).
However, I don't think this will happen any time soon because I'm not sure if teams are implemented at all.

14) Draw5PlayAll: Build Y2 Draw5playall
	Felix: Despite the threatening message of suicide bombers received by an alien race somewhere to the south of us, we are sending out one of our small trade vessels in search of peaceful people with which to trade. The vessel is fragile and unprotected, but it has discovered a small and seemingly peaceful forest planet. We are dubbing this planet "LittleWood." The planet seems conducive to a construction facility, so we are installing a ship factory on the planet and soon hope to produce larger ships that will protect our small trade vessel. We hope that the suicide bomber threats are simply a ruse.
	Felix: (I hadn't thought of that problem in a 4p game but I believe you're right. I still think it could be fun to give it a try though! Would love to have you join in and see how it goes.
	Draw5PlayAll: We are risk-takers, and decided to upsize our ships in the warp drive industry. 
We have also canceled the threat. There has been some slight amounts of radiation coming from the warp drives, and we fear it will be too much if we don't explore soon.
 
--
So far, I dislike the map structuring. Specifically, the proximity from your base to DangerZone, despite both systems having a Large. I keep getting tempted to barge in to Little Wood, despite impossibility.

15) Felix: Build B2 Littlewood
	Draw5PlayAll: We detected aliens from DangerZone and LittleWood are observing our actions. I hope they leave soon because this could get messy.

16) Draw5PlayAll: Move Y1 Draw5playall Dangerzone
	Felix: Fearing attack from the nearby DangerZone system, our colony on LittleWood has decided to build a larger trade vessel to help protect the smaller. We do not wish a confrontation, as we are a peaceful trading people, so we are not equipping our vessels with weapons at the moment.
	Felix: (It does take some time to get one's head around the movement and layout on here. It's much easier to arrange things how you wish when playing on a table.)
	Draw5PlayAll: We decided to fly a Constellation-class ship into Danger Zone. With the earlier green ship we could potentially upsize our fleet.

17) Felix: Build Y2 Felix
	Felix: The lack of warp capability in our LittleWood colony is worrisome, so we are creating a new warp vessel at home to send out to the colony.

18) Draw5PlayAll: Trade Y1 R1 Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: Since your mission is peace, you clearly don't need to be involved in the red economy. Plus we want to diversify our fleet. Red seemed like a good option, just in case you changed your mind at some point.

19) Felix: Move Y2 Felix Littlewood
	Felix: Our sensors indicate that the alien race to the south is developing weapons in its home system. This is troubling for a peaceful people such as ourselves. We may need to arm ourselves with a warship, purely for defensive reasons, of course. But first, we are sending our new warship out to the LittleWood colony so that the colony can evacuate if an attack should come from our southern neighbors.

20) Draw5PlayAll: Discover R1 Draw5playall Y3 Biglemon
	Draw5PlayAll: Well, fine then. If you prefer, we are sending the weaponed ship to a new, more peaceful star known as the Big Lemon. Seems like a strange name for a star.

21) Felix: Trade B1 R1 Littlewood
	Draw5PlayAll: The map got completely messed up. The large stars should be closer to me than they are to you.
	Felix: Since we now have a larger trade ship capable of carrying out our trade directives, we no longer need our smallest trade vessel, so we will be stripping out its trade facilities and replacing them with weapons. This is purely for defense, since the alien warship located at the Big Lemon is only one warp jump away from us.

22) Draw5PlayAll: Build Y1 Dangerzone
	Felix: The map looks right to me, but it does sometimes get messed up. You just have to think of it more abstractly and less literally in terms of distance.
	Draw5PlayAll: Well, in this case, we're just going to build another yellow ship at Danger Zone.

23) Felix: Build Y2 Littlewood

24) Draw5PlayAll: Build Y3 Draw5playall
	Felix: We see the need to explore further in search of peaceful species with which to trade, so we are increasing our fleet with a new warp ship.
	Draw5PlayAll: Well, our Ambassador-class ships aren't enough. We are going to Galaxy-class. And it's being built right here in the base.

25) Felix: Build Y3 Felix
	Felix: We have noticed that the resources required for building Galaxy-class warp ships have dropped to nearly nonexistent levels. We suspect the aliens to the south of us are also drawing on the same resources. We are going to build our own galaxy-class warp cruiser to make sure we have one before resources are fully depleted.

26) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Dangerzone
	Draw5PlayAll: Ah, you've robbed us of the blue economy! Well then, we're going to a planet covered in ice, and sending a construction ship with the boost from the warp ships in Danger Zone. We have a way of transporting ships without sacrificing, so long as we have a yellow in the area.
	Draw5PlayAll: Slight change in plans. We decided we needed more resources and are just going to build another construction ship in the danger zone.
Our star charts lost the planet in the process.

27) Felix: Build B1 Littlewood

28) Draw5PlayAll: Build G2 Dangerzone
	Felix: We are building a new trade vessel to send out on a contact mission of peace.
	Draw5PlayAll: Despite the potential for catastrophe, we have decided to build an Ambassador-class construction ship in the Danger Zone system. We are aware that you have the means to invade with your large green but you would be unwise to do so.

29) Felix: Move B2 Littlewood Biglemon

30) Draw5PlayAll: Discover G1 Dangerzone B2 Epsilonvi
	Felix: We have sent our liaison-class trade vessel on a mission of discovery and peace. A particularly large desert planet has shown up on our charts so we are beginning our search there. Hopefully the denizens of this big lemon are peaceful.
	Draw5PlayAll: Meanwhile our own people at Danger Zone realized the, well, danger.. They decided to flee off to a small watery planet, but the name is unknown....

31) Felix: Sacrifice R1 Littlewood
Attack R1 Biglemon
	Draw5PlayAll: As soon as we were within sensor range, aliens completely obliterated the planet and killed themselves in the act. A time warp sent us back to where we started.
	Draw5PlayAll: One of the crew was able to prevent the same mistake from occurring again. We instead ventured to a slightly larger planet Epsilon VI, again covered in water.

32) Draw5PlayAll: Build G2 Epsilonvi
	Felix: We made contact with a small vessel at BigLemon. However, the small vessel appears to be armed with high powered lasers and warheads. We were expecting to open peaceful trade relations with this people, but they seem to be aggressive. We have no choice but to take over this vessel so that it does not harm us or our people. Purely defensive measures, you understand. Our defensive vessel in LittleWood is sending a warp-powered boarding crew to take the ship intact.

33) Felix: Build G2 Felix
	Felix: Unfortunately, the amount of power required to send the warp-powered boarding vessel was too much for our defense ship's core to handle. The ship self-destructed in the process, but we were able to successfully take over the enemy vessel, so we are calling it even.
	Draw5PlayAll: Our small Constellation ship at Epsilon VI is lonely and we decided to build an Ambassador-class construction vessel on that planet.

34) Draw5PlayAll: Trade G2 B2 Epsilonvi

35) Felix: Sacrifice G3 Felix
Build B3 Biglemon
Build B3 Littlewood
Build G2 Felix
	Felix: We are short on construction ships, so we are building a new construction vessel in our home system.
	Draw5PlayAll: Despite the knowledge that you can send suicide ships to destroy me, we traded out the construction power of our Ambassador-class ship at Epsilon VI for trading power, using the planet of course.
---
You have the possibility of sacrificing a medium yellow to bring two blues into Epsilon VI and call catastrophe. If you don't, we will begin actions you will not like.

36) Draw5PlayAll: Build G3 Epsilonvi

37) Felix: Discover G2 Felix R1 Lavaflow
	Felix: We have ignored your beckon to cause a catastrophe on Epsilon VI. We do not believe in such overt aggression as a suicide attack. Instead, we tried to send our biggest construction vessel out to LittleWood to begin construction operations there. However, something strange happened in transit and our ship entered a wormhole. When it came out the other side of the wormhole, it had been split into three ships, a medium construction ship and two large trade vessels! These ships showed up in random locations around our domain. We aren't sure what happened in the wormhole, but we are happy with the net gain to our fleet.
	Draw5PlayAll: We build a Galaxy-class construction vessel in Epsilon VI. Go on, blow us up. We dare you.

Ha, just right after I got a blue, you removed the color from the stash. I need two turns in a row here!!

38) Draw5PlayAll: Sacrifice Y1 Dangerzone
Move G3 Epsilonvi Lavaflow
	Draw5PlayAll: I see us both left with a single medium red as our homeworlds.
Here's what I see for you:
You run a ship into Little Wood and then sac a yellow to bomb our small blue star, leaving me with just a red. (There's a change you might sabotage my yellow economy, but I think that won't work.)
Meanwhile I see multiple ways that I can get to YOUR homeworld and either call catastrophe or sabotage your Planetary Defense System (if you sac your only large there and I get a large inside, you can't attack me).
	Felix: Interesting prediction :) We shall see! It's generally a terrible idea to ever leave your homeworld without a large ship to defend it, so I will tell you that I am unlikely to sac my y3 any time soon...

39) Felix: S G2 Lavaflow
B R1 Biglemon
B R2 Biglemon
	Felix: We were intending to send our medium construction vessel out to Big Lemon to establish a factory on that world, but the vessel became lost in transit and ended up stumbling upon a small planet covered in active volcanoes. We have dubbed this planet Lava Flow and may commence our construction operations here.
	Draw5PlayAll: Oh no. This is bad. This is really bad.
 
The large green from Epsilon VI heard about this lava planet and decided to go there. We used the engine from a yellow at DangerZone, but said engine broke down as soon as we reached Lava Flow.

40) Draw5PlayAll: Sacrifice G2 Dangerzone
Build G2 Lavaflow
Build G2 Epsilonvi

41) Felix: Build G3 Felix
	Felix: Our construction vessel on lava flow was startled by the appearance of a large and unknown ship. It lost control and careened into the planet, blowing itself up. The construction energy within the ship reacted with the planet, however, and created two new warships equipped with heat lasers. The reaction propelled these new ships back over to big lemon for some reason...
	Draw5PlayAll: I can't think of a good way to phrase this move in our... narrative...

42) Draw5PlayAll: Sacrifice Y2 Draw5playall
Move G2 Lavaflow Felix
Move G3 Lavaflow Felix
Catastrophe Felix Green
	Draw5PlayAll: You know, the only reason I picked a 1-2 home world is for the Investment strategy, where I park a single green at a star and try to cash it in via a sacrifice. Result? I got *nearly* frozen out of blue.
	Felix: That's okay if you we don't narrate every move. it's fun though! And yeah... the banker strategy is a good one though! It's definitely the strongest homeworld set up and can be used very effectively, but I have found it difficult to actually pull off the "banker" move in games.

43) Felix: Move R1 Biglemon Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: We wanted to trade for a Galaxy-class attacking ship but the risk of invasion is just too great. We instead decided to run a suicide mission to hold back your green economy.

44) Draw5PlayAll: Sacrifice G2 Epsilonvi
Build Y1 Draw5playall
Build Y2 Dangerzone

45) Felix: Discover B1 Littlewood G3 Bigwood
	Felix: Despite our peaceful intentions, it seems the aliens to our south are a warlike species interested only in our destruction. We are sending out one of our small warships on a scouting mission to their homeworld to see if we can find a way to neutralize their weapons. Purely in self defense, of course.
	Draw5PlayAll: Not sure if there's anything I can do here. You rip away my red next move, then you can sac yellows to throw your blues at me and wipe out my homeworld. My only shot here is to...

46) Draw5PlayAll: Sacrifice Y3 Draw5playall
Move Y2 Dangerzone Littlewood
Move Y1 Dangerzone Littlewood
Discover B2 Epsilonvi R1 Lavaflow
Catastrophe Littlewood Yellow
	Draw5PlayAll: We have developed a "distant construction" device, and used it on our G2 in Epsilon VI, but it has a problem. It draws so much power that the ship self-destructs in the process.
	Draw5PlayAll: This game will be very close.

47) Felix: Move R1 Biglemon Draw5playall
	Felix: Little did we know that the planet Little Wood was actually just a forest moon for a much larger forest planet. We're not very creative, so we're dubbing this planet Big Wood.
	Draw5PlayAll: There's only one thing I can really do at this point. Commence Brutal Destruction!!

	Felix: Our small warship needs backup in the alien home system. Soon, we will be able to neutralize all weapons, and then perhaps we can build peace between our peoples...
	Draw5PlayAll: Facing unavoidable doom, we had a last ditch effort to save our remaining crew. We piled everyone into our large green and used engines from the yellow to flee into space. We also poisoned the planets with lots of deadly gases and radiation (there were nobody there except us) so we leave nothing behind for the "peaceful" invaders in the direction of Polaris.
 

 
Good game. I just needed two more moves, attack red and move it away. Sadly when I ransacked your yellow economy in the Little Wood system, you had the move advantage to destroy us. I had traps set if you sacrificed too early. But you managed to trap me in a corner.
 
Perhaps we will meet again. In the meantime, so long, and thanks for all the fish. (Yes, we tried to raid your incoming red ships. We failed, but at least we got some fish.)
	Felix: Great game yourself! Very well played for a beginner. You will have a very solid grasp on the strategy with a few more games. I'd love to have a rematch any time! Enjoy that fish!
