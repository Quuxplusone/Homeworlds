5) agents17: Build G1 Agents17
	agents17: Indeed, anything I ought to know?

6) Felix: Trade B3 Y3 Felix
	Felix: If I think of anything, I'll let you know! So far, you're looking good. Swapping for a yellow soon would be wise, and then moving some ships out to create space so you can try to build up your armada as quickly as possible. Try to diversify your colors as quickly as possible so you have a nice balance across multiple systems. I like to not have more than 2 of the same color in a system for more than a turn if I can help it.

7) agents17: Trade G1 Y1 Agents17
	Felix: I did a sneaky maneuver here at the start to prevent you from getting any of the small blues, so you won't be able to trade for them until you get a medium ship, unless you wanted to trade away your g3, which is not really recommended.

8) Felix: Build B2 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: It could have backfired!!

9) agents17: Discover G1 Agents17 B3 Alpha

10) Felix: Trade B2 G2 Felix
	agents17: Thanks for the advice. Also, is Draw5playAll watching?
	Felix: You're welcome! Yeah, I think anyone who wants to can watch any of the games, and he seems to like to stalk on other players more than most :)
 
@Draw5 - It could only have backfired if I made a mistake, but I've done this maneuver a few times and it usually works out!

11) agents17: Build G1 Agents17
