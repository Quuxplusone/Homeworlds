Catastrophe Ts52 Yellow
	Draw5PlayAll: My last move actually seemed to be a losing move.
	ts52: Agreed, I think if you destroyed yellow instead of blue, it would've cost you the game. Instead....
	ts52: Hmm, guess I didn't look at your undone move close enough. But you're definitely in a stronger position with the move you ended up going with.

	Draw5PlayAll: I blew up your greens and blues in the first case. Here I kept your greens and went after yellow.
	Draw5PlayAll: Good game! I suppose that brings my Homeworlds Number to 3...
	ts52: Indeed, good game. Your Homeworlds Number?
	Draw5PlayAll: Andrew Looney's number is 1.
If you beat him, your number goes to 2.
And in general, if you beat someone with number n (smaller than your own), yours is n-1.
 
Since I think you beat Andy, yours is 2, and since I just beat you (albeit on SDG) that takes me to 3.
	ts52: Ah, that makes sense... :)
