jbj77: I might as well give it up. I have no chance. Good game though. I'm going to have to study this B1 G3 B3 opening some more. I'm not sure if I just messed it up or what. In any case you played very well, and deserve the victory.
mneme: thanks -- good game! You mean b1 g3 Y3?

jbj77: No I mean Homeworldd (B1 G3 B3) which was my opening move. Trying to get a blue monopoly quickly. It seems difficult to get it to work.
mneme: Not sure. Looking at the full log, it did let you get three large ships early, but you weren't able to capitalize on the advantage (and then I started causing catastrophes)
