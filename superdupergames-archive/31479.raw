	Laurie_Menke: Hi MobyNostromo... I just wanted to let you and w00t know that I'm making a list of games to ask Aaron to end due to abandonment.  I know you are both currently active on SDG right now, but this game seems abandoned, so I am going to include it on the list unless one of you says not to in the next 24 hours.  I hope that's the right thing to do.  :)
	MobyNostromo: Thank you for asking. Sure, go ahead and cancel this one.
	Laurie_Menke: Hi MobyNostromo, Aaron already did his sweep, but didn't take this one out because he wasn't sure if you wanted it.  He may still do it now, but I'm not sure.
	Draw5PlayAll: I guess what you could do is click the "Terminate Game (unrated)" option.
