Catastrophe Thorolf G

	wil: every monopoly can hurt, in blue can keep you from changing and creates that queen factory, in red keeps you from attacking and leaves you vulnerable, in green keeps you from building, in yellow keeps you from moving and creating new territory.
	wil: always at risk when you have only one color in your homeworld.  You are playing my strategy, I lost 90% of my first 50 games...  insuring someone doesn't block you out of a color is important.

	wil: challenge me anytime...
