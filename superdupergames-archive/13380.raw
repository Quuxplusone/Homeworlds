Pass
Jesse: That would have been a good way to gain a red advantage, if it hadn't left your homeworld undefended. You could almost get away with it, but I think I have it covered. A better alternative would have been to trade your g3 for an r3, a move I had been considering myself to improve my homeworld defense and my red distribution.

29) Jesse: Sacrifice R1 Time
Attack G1 Skykingt13
Jesse: Thanks for the game. You played an excellent opening, forcing me to let you take a few small advantages. Things didn't go wrong for you until your discovery of Sky let me grab the remainder of the yellow.
