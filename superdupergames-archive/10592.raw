	benji_stein: You going to copy everything I do? :P

	benji_stein: You going to copy everything I do? :P

	benji_stein: Hmm. This is probably a really bad idea. But I'll risk it.

10) Jesse: Build Y1 Jesse

11) benji_stein: Build B1 Benji_stein

12) Jesse: Move Y3 Jesse Benji_stein
	Jesse: The first few moves are often roughly symmetrical.  It's not necessarily the only way, but it's often a good way to avoid being cut off from something important.  In this case, the blue economy, which was the quickest path to medium-sized ships.
 
And to your second point, yes.  I do believe that was too aggressive.  You damage my home system, but you leave yours without the defense of a large ship, so that I can likely just stroll in and capture your ships.

13) benji_stein: Trade B2 G2 Benji_stein
	benji_stein: Oh, I realize that the early moves can be similar, I've just never see it so move-for-move identical, other than the sizes of the pieces in our homeworlds. I was mostly just teasing.
 
You're probably right about not having a big ship; I somehow missed that it now brings our worlds next to each other. :(

14) Jesse: Trade Y3 R3 Benji_stein
	Jesse: Yeah, that's an easy oversight to make.

	Jesse: A green ship doesn't really help you, at this point.  To counter-attack, you need red and yellow.  If you'd traded for a red ship before I did, it would have given me some problems.
	benji_stein: Yeah. I had a brain-fart. I'd wanted to sacrifice the green ship and then build two others. I would have loved two red, but realized after I did it that the only thing I could build was blue, which doesn't help any.
 
With red, it's a little better, but I think we just end in a stalemate, or you sacrifice your big ship to attack more of mine.
	benji_stein: But you're right. Far too agressive a move so early in the game; it's yours. Care for another?
	benji_stein: Out of curiosity, and so I can learn more strategy, what would you have done if I'd swapped my b2 for a r2 instead?
	Jesse: If you had swapped for a red, I couldn't have swapped for a red.  (You could build another red, then another, and blow up my large ship.  I could only have forestalled that by capturing your blue, but you could just capture it back endlessly.)  So, I could either withdraw my y3 to defend my home system, essentially wasting two turns, or I could leave it there, and start building in my home system.  My objective would be to get a medium piece at home for defense, and to move out to a blue system to obtain reds I could sacrifice to take over your system.  It would be an awkward operation, and if I'd read that possibility before I moved into your home system, I might have played more conservatively.
 
And yes, I'm always happy to help a new player on the road.
	benji_stein: Interesting. I'm kind of curious as to how a game like that would have panned out, but I'm pretty sure I would have slipped up some other way to lose. If you'd like, I'd be willing to play it out, and offer to resign if I end up in a winning position.
 
Otherwise, we can play a fresh game (eg without my taking a huge risk so early). I've gone ahead and started a new game with you, I'll let it be your call, though I think there'll need to be a pass at some point to get it to the same turn order.
