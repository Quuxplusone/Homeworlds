Participants: Ottia (S), MobyNostromo (N)
Winner: MobyNostromo

1) MobyNostromo: H G1 Y2 B3
	Ottia: Hiya Rey! I still haven't got tons of time to play anything but I thought we could at least get one single game going, especially one with such a learning curve...
 
...fatherhood is fantastic. I need more time to elaborate on it properly...
	MobyNostromo: Hey Antonio! I'm glad you're enjoying being a father. I'm finally teaching my daughter Spanish; she is doing very well in English and Korean but knows very little Spanish. She's slowly picking up individual words. With all the languages you know, your child will easily become a polyglot!

2) Ottia: Homeworld G3 B2 Y3
	MobyNostromo: I forgot: have you played this game before? I'm almost brand new.

3) MobyNostromo: B B1 Mobynostromo
	Ottia: I played it once aaaaages ago. It seems like a deep, rewarding game... one of those you can play your whole lifetime. I would like to learn to play it properly - since you had an open invitation and we already have a way of "cracking games open" together it was quite an easy decision...
 
...that said, I barely remember a thing about it.
	Ottia: As far as Melissa's languages are concerned, we will try at first to raise her bilingual (EN, ES)... German will come afterwards and then whatever she wants to learn; we could help her in French and Italian but if she wants to start with something else, then welcome... the more the merrier! For years and years Eleanor (my wife) and I have had the temptation to start learning Japanese but never quite found the time for it...
	Draw5PlayAll: You do realize the chat and games are public, right?
	MobyNostromo: Nice!! I was not kidding when I used the word, polyglot, and now I know there was no exaggeration on my part. I used to know a little Japanese, but it's mostly gone. Fascinating to learn a language that has no ties whatsoever to your own.

	MobyNostromo: Let's crack this game open!!

	Ottia: Thanks to Draw5PlayAll to point that out. I'm fine with everyone reading what I've written so far but I'll definitely follow your advice and move the conversation elsewhere. For the time being, I'll start another game.
	Ottia: (for pointing that out, I mean... little sleep, slow brain)
