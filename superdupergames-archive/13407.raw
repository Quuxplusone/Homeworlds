Mouce: well played!
zoltar: Thanks. I thought it was a great, close game until I sacked the g2 for the two remaining y3s. I figured you were going after 2 of the 3 r3s (I'd get one of them), and I've have the advantage, with all the yellow power, but far from a won game. Your trading pieces instead and letting my Y3s chase and destroy your fleet proved instead disastrous. Play again?
Mouce: yeah, take me up for another challenge
