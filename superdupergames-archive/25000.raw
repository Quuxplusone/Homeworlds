	foksieloy: Oh damn, didn't expect that, nice. Good game!
	wil: I don't know if it has a name....but you move in with one....getting set to catastrophe...if they resppond with an attack you move in with another, if they don't, you grow...tis the bain of having a green star.
	foksieloy: I will have to remember that one! :)
	wil: Yes, losing a dozen games teaches you a dozen things to avoid and a  dozen ways to win.  Steven Covey in Seven Habits of Highly Effective people...one of the habits is 'Begin with the end in mind'  that is what I focus on...I have to either take out your star system, or eliminate your ships from your star system...so I try to insure that I make that hard for you to do to me, and keep lookng at what I need to accumulate to do that to you...
