20) zoltar: Move G2 Hydra Bonanza
	zoltar: I suppose you can factory here and get an extra build as well as take all the greens that are left, but what else could I do?  Yet again, I feel utterly lost at this point in the game.  Am I missing any key concepts here?
	TwoShort: At this point I can take the remaining greens, and that's it (which I may).  Often there are moves where you can't do anything right away, and you want to think about what things you could be threatening to do in the future.  Ideally, I want to advance as many potential agendas as possible.  You could advance a green, so as to threaten disater in my homeworld if I grow a third.  You could threaten the same thing with a 2 point yellow, so you might move your 1 point out to somewhere you can safely grow (it won't have to be green if the factories come on line); that would also help burn through the yellows.  If the 1 & 2 yellows are gone, you'll be able to sacrifice your g's at Nix and/or hydra to grow the system markers as ships.  That's a strategy called "cashing an investment".  The key concept at this point is who winds up with more 3 point ships as the first couple colors run out.  And of course, not letting the other guy surprise you and blow up your homeworld :)

42) zoltar: Attack Y2 Zoltar
	zoltar: Never saw the Yellow attack coming, as usual...
	TwoShort: Well, it's an attack out of semi-desperation; destroying half your homeworld doesn't finish you off, and leaves you with an advantage in ships...  but with you presuring me with your sacrificeable red threat, it seemed like time to use 'em or lose 'em.  So now it's a question of whether you can take control before I can get together the blues to finish you.  Of course, you're not forcing me to pull the trigger on the yellow catastrophe, so I naturally think about whether it's better to wait; and that 1 pointer in my homeworld certainly makes me nervous, though so far I don't see how it can do more than take out my G3, which would be painful, but I think recoverable so long as I keep the other 3 there and some green elsewhere.  In short, you have hearby graduated from "enthusiastic beginner" to "interesting opponent"...  So now I need to think a bit to figure out what to do here.

43) TwoShort: Trade Y2 R2 Zoltar
Catastrophe Zoltar Red
	zoltar: Well, I'm afraid I haven't a clue what to do here, nor how to attack, and you've sidestepped my green threat, so I suppose I'll sleep on it and look at the position tomorrow.  And thanks, I'm glad I'm putting up a bit of a fight, as I was worried I was going to be boring you after a while; I hope I can make things interesting.  My goal now is to knock out one of your stars before I die!
