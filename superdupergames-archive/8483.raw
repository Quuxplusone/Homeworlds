	nycavri: Thanks for the game.  The early game strategy is to work towards getting bigger ships while preventing you opponent doing the same.  If you can shut them out of ships of one color entirely, so much the better.  Easier said than done however, as seen by my sub 1500 rating!  Feel free to challenge again, unrated if you prefer.
