Homeworlds Online (SDG# 34210)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2018.6.26, Ended: 2018.7.6
Participants: DodoBirb (S), Babamots (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) Babamots: Homeworld B3 R2 G3
	Babamots: So you'd like a Homeworlds lesson? I'll try to explain strategy as we go.

2) DodoBirb: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3
	Babamots: How much have you played? I can explain every detail or I can leave out the basics.
	Babamots: I'm taking a large-medium home system, which has a low win rate. A medium-small home had the best win rate, probably because it let's you move to large systems right away and therefore control the larges in the stash.

3) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots
	DodoBirb: This is my first game. I know the rules and a bit of strategy but I want to see how it all works against a real opponent.

4) DodoBirb: Build G1 Dodobirb
	Babamots: Cool! The first few moves will be building and getting new ship colors. There's not usually too much strategy yet.

5) Babamots: Trade G1 Y1 Babamots

6) DodoBirb: Trade G1 Y1 Dodobirb
	Babamots: One of the first things to watch for is getting "frozen out" of a color. Suppose I keep building y1 and you don't trade for a y1. Then the y1 will all be used and you will have no yellow ships. In order to get any yellow ships, you will have to get a medium of another color and trade for a y2.

7) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots

8) DodoBirb: Build G1 Dodobirb
	DodoBirb: Should I have traded early like that or waited a turn? 

9) Babamots: Trade G1 B1 Babamots
	Babamots: Either was fine in this case. The main thing is not to let me get all the smalls of any color (or you'll be frozen out) and don't take the last small of any color I can build (or I'll get the first medium).
	Babamots: Of course, it's OK to let me get a medium if you can get your own on your next move. You just don't want to fall behind.

10) DodoBirb: Trade G1 B1 Dodobirb
	Babamots: Like here, it's OK to trade for a b1 because, even though I can build b2, you can build b2 too.

11) Babamots: Build B2 Babamots

12) DodoBirb: Build B2 Dodobirb

13) Babamots: Trade B2 Y2 Babamots
	Babamots: I'm planning to trade for y2 and threaten a blue catastrophe at your home.

14) DodoBirb: Discover B2 Dodobirb Y3 Yellow
	Babamots: I'm too tired to count. I would need to have a y3 to sacrifice and catastrophe. 
	Babamots: It's 3 AM here. I'm not at my sharpest :-)
	DodoBirb: Sorry if I'm keeping you up, I'm in Australia so it's early in the afternoon for me.

15) Babamots: Discover Y1 Babamots Y1 Iconia
	Babamots: My plan for my next move would give me almost a yellow monopoly and another large ship. It is
sacrifice g3 Babamots
build y2 Iconia
build y3 Babamots
build y3 Babamots
 
You can prevent it in a couple of ways. Want to look for them or have me tell you? 

16) DodoBirb: Discover B1 Dodobirb Y3 Sun
	DodoBirb: I'll look. If I can't find them I'll probably ask.
	DodoBirb: I can move my y1 at my homeworld into Iconia to stop you from building a yellow ship there.
	DodoBirb: Oh oops the systems aren't connected

17) Babamots: Build B2 Babamots
	Babamots: I would have recommended discovering another y3 system to user up the piece. 
	DodoBirb: Is that because my move stops me from making more yellow?
	Babamots: It looks like your plan is to move y1 to Iconia after I build so you can catastrophe the system. It's true you lose your only yellow ship (so you'll have to trade again to build yellows), but also, I come out ahead by a large ship.
	Babamots: You can still undo if you'd like. Up to you. 

18) DodoBirb: Build G1 Dodobirb

19) Babamots: Discover B2 Babamots G1 Risa

20) DodoBirb: Move G1 Dodobirb Yellow
	Babamots: Here's a big-picture suggestion. You seem to have known how important it is to have blue and green in your home system. You'll also want to get at least one other system with blue and green. That gives you another  place to build and diversify and less worry about overpopulation.
 
When the homeworlds are three moves apart (like ours), I usually like to start building my invasion fleet in a system that is one move away from my home and gradually move it to two different systems that are connected to my opponent's home. By spreading across three systems, there's little chance of overpopulation. A mistake I see pretty often is that someone tries to build a whole fleet in one system, which gives me lots of opportunities to threaten catastrophes.
 
I've been aching to give someone this tip, and you're the lucky recipient :-).

21) Babamots: Build Y2 Babamots
	Babamots: And with that I'd better get some sleep. It's hard for me to keep a decent schedule when I don't have time-sensitive obligations the next day.

22) DodoBirb: Discover Y1 Dodobirb Y3 Echo

23) Babamots: Build B2 Babamots
	Babamots: Even though you could build a y3, I would cheerfully sacrifice my y2 to move my y1 to your home for a catastrophe.
 
The danger of yellow catastrophes on my home stars is the main reason I see to use red rather than yellow as a home marker color. I'm not sure which is better, but a yellow home marker always seems to cause a frustrating moment where I want to build yellow at home but can't.
	Draw5PlayAll: Exactly my reason for using red. I know they say to use yellow for beginners but then your options for storing yellows is more limited. I can often get 4-5 yellows and the homeworld is a nice place to put them.

24) DodoBirb: Build B3 Yellow
	DodoBirb: I couldn't really build yellow anywhere so I just had to stop you from taking it.
	Babamots: Yep, it was a good move. I think the next thing you should work on is turning some of those y3 systems into ships. If you move your b2 away from "yellow," you can sacrifice your g1 in yellow to build y3 (since the system marker becomes available for building the instant that last ship is gone). Of course, you'll need to put a yellow ship somewhere that you can safely build a y3...
	Babamots: Meanwhile, my plan is to make more important things come up so you don't get around to building those y3s. For starters, you're not going to want to pass up a chance to build a b3.

25) Babamots: Build B3 Risa
	Babamots: My plan for the next few moves is to get some red and take advantage of the fact that I have more medium ships. Even if you get red ships too, my mediums can chase your smalls around and keep them off the y3 systems so you can't build y3.
 
Something else will probably come up to distract me from that plan, but that's what I'm hoping to work on for the next several moves.

26) DodoBirb: Build G1 Dodobirb

27) Babamots: Trade B3 R3 Risa

28) DodoBirb: Trade B3 R3 Yellow
	Babamots: Since I'm about to trade for a red ship, you need a red ship immediately. Otherwise, I can sacrifice a y2 to send my large to your homeworld and take it over.

29) Babamots: Trade B1 R1 Babamots

30) DodoBirb: Build R1 Yellow

31) Babamots: Build G2 Babamots

32) DodoBirb: Build G2 Dodobirb

33) Babamots: Move G2 Babamots Iconia
	Babamots: My plan is to eventually move my g2 to either Sun or Echo. Then, I either get to capture a ship (by sacrificing my r1) or, if your ship leaves, I get to sacrifice my g2 to build a y3 with the system marker.

34) DodoBirb: Trade G2 R2 Dodobirb
	Babamots: My next move puts you in check. I could sacrifice y2 to move my g2 to your home and catastrophe all the ships there. So you'll need to move or trade a green at home to keep me from winning. Technically, you could also save yourself by moving another ship to your home, but that still lets me destroy three of your ships.

35) Babamots: Move G2 Iconia Sun

36) DodoBirb: Move B1 Sun Dodobirb

37) Babamots: Sacrifice G2 Sun
Build G2 Babamots
Build Y3 Babamots

38) DodoBirb: Build G2 Yellow

39) Babamots: Move Y2 Babamots Risa

40) DodoBirb: Discover G1 Dodobirb B3 Deepblue

41) Babamots: Move B2 Babamots Iconia

42) DodoBirb: Discover R1 Yellow R1 Reddwarf

43) Babamots: Move R3 Risa Deepblue

44) DodoBirb: Move R3 Yellow Risa
	Babamots: I think you're playing extremely well, so I haven't felt like you needed advice for a while. I can say more if you're feeling lost, but it sure doesn't look like you need my help.
	Babamots: Since your ships are pretty spread out, you're well prepared to make a green sacrifice triple build and get another large ship if I make the smallest mistake.
	Babamots: My big advantage is dominating the yellows. I can sacrifice to move two or three times while you're limited to one. 

45) Babamots: Sacrifice Y2 Risa
Move B2 Risa Echo
Move B2 Echo Dodobirb
	Babamots: Your g1 can escape almost like a yellow by sacrificing and rebuilding. Also, you could counter-attack at Risa with your r3.

46) DodoBirb: Move B1 Dodobirb Yellow

47) Babamots: Sacrifice G3 Babamots
Build B1 Dodobirb
Build B3 Dodobirb
Build Y2 Babamots
Catastrophe Dodobirb B

48) DodoBirb: Sacrifice G1 Deepblue
Build G1 Dodobirb

49) Babamots: Move Y2 Babamots Reddwarf

50) DodoBirb: Sacrifice G2 Yellow
Build R2 Reddwarf
Build R3 Reddwarf
Catastrophe Reddwarf R
	Babamots: Sorry if I haven't been as instructive as you'd like. I didn't know myself what I would do if you counter-attacked back there, or I should have warned you that the time was right to start the real attack.
 
At this point, it will be very difficult to defend your home from a game-ending yellow catastrophe. I've got most of the yellow, so I don't think you'll be able to move your ships around to effectively intercept my invasion. I'm planning to move my y2s to small systems and then move three yellows to your home all at once.
	DodoBirb: Don't worry about it. I've learnt quite a bit from this game. I'll see how long I can hold out against your yellow onslaught (probably not for very long).

51) Babamots: Build Y2 Babamots
	Draw5PlayAll: I see something... interesting.
	Babamots: You're welcome to give suggestions to DodoBirb. I don't see anything that will do more than buy a few moves (like sacrificing green to build two reds in RedDwarf and destroying my y2. I can rebuild it, but it sets me back a move).
	Draw5PlayAll: Rebuild it where?
	Babamots: I would rebuild it in my home system. That makes three yellows there, but the y1 in Echo can't reach my home for a catastrophe in one move.

52) DodoBirb: Trade B2 R2 Yellow

53) Babamots: Discover Y2 Babamots B1 Bolius

54) DodoBirb: Sacrifice G3 Dodobirb
Build R1 Risa
Build R1 Yellow
Build R3 Dodobirb

55) Babamots: Sacrifice Y3 Babamots
Move Y2 Babamots Bolius
Move Y2 Bolius Dodobirb
Move Y1 Iconia Dodobirb
	Babamots: So you know, I'm planning to sacrifice my y3 on my next move. I will move two yellows to your home and move my y2 from Babamots to a small system -- maybe Bolius. I don't believe there's anything you can do to prevent me from then moving that y2 to your home and having the four yellows there I need to win.
	Babamots: Also, if you ever want to study games after they're over, an easy way is with SDG's "Archive View" (you can look at every position in the whole game history). This page can be a little hard to find, but I wrote some Javascript that makes it super easy. The code and instructions are here:

56) DodoBirb: Sacrifice Y1 Echo
Move R3 Risa Babamots
	Draw5PlayAll: ?page=play&gid=34210 should redirect to the Play page, and thus you can heavily reduce the size of your code.

57) Babamots: Move Y2 Bolius Dodobirb
Catastrophe Dodobirb Y
	Babamots: Hey, you're right! I can shorten the code lots now.
	Babamots: As for the game, if I weren't about to win, this would be kind of a bad position for me. I don't have a large ship at my home, so you can move you r3 to my home, preparing to gobble up all my home ships. My only defensive move would be to sacrifice a y2 to move my own r3 to my home and catastrophe away you r3. I would lose a ship of each size (y2, r1, r3) and a home star compared to your y1 (for the movement) and r3.

	DodoBirb: GG. Thanks for this teaching game. I learned a lot from just playing against someone better than me.
	Babamots: I tried to be instructive, and at least you got to see some strategy in action. Do you have anyone you'll be able to play in person? I'm happy to have another game, though the time difference will make it take a while.
	DodoBirb: I do have some people I can play in person but they're usually pretty busy.
