zoltar: Very, very dangerous, and though I'm ahead a couple of small pieces, it doesn't warrant taking your 3-pip defender out of your homeworld. It's worth it to me, then, to sacrifice lots of stuff to blow up your battlestar, as we'll be left with a simplified position where I have a large defender and you don't.

zoltar: Now either I'll build fast and invade and win outright, or else, in the best case for you, I'll only build a huge lead while you scramble to defend your homeworld and get another 3-pip ship.

zoltar: In sum, it's a cardinal sin in homeworlds to leave your homeworld without a 3-pip ship, unless you are threatening checkmate and your opponent has to respond.
