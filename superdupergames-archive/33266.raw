35) Babamots: Build G1 Pakled
	Babamots: I wish ts52 would move as quickly as you. I think I'm doing better in my game with him.
	Babamots: Meaning that, in general, I think people move more slowly when they're losing, which is too bad for their opponents who would usually like to hurry up and win.

36) ajo: Build Y2 Ajo

37) Babamots: Build G2 Babamots
	ajo: I think you're right, but that's only to be expected in any game. :) Another reason it might happen in Homeworlds is that I often set up the pieces offline so I can visualize the position better than I can with the SDG interface. But in this game I'm doing well enough that I haven't felt the need for physical pieces yet. ;)
	Babamots: I usually manage to put up at least a little bit of a fight, but not so much this time.
	Babamots: I'm trying to decide whether to quit and forget this game ever happened or sit around hoping you'll make a colossal mistake.

	Babamots: I think I'll stop here and focus on the tournament. Maybe I'll give you trouble next time :-).
	ajo: Good game! :)
