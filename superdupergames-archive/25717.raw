4) wil: B B1 Wil
	wil: Very cool!  A physical set not only allows you to play with friends but also setting it up to mirror the computer games allows you to see the situation more clearly and test moves (this interface is lousy but all we got). Are you stateside?  I am near DC

6) wil: B B1 Wil
	vanoosbree: I spent a couple months in DC and am in the San Fran bay area these days. Good gaming community here (wish I had more free time) and my SO is very indulgent ;)
	wil: I used to live in Carson city, my sister in SF and visited often...wunnerful town...napa sonoma weren't bad either....Marin, mariposa...memories

7) vanoosbree: Build G1 Vanoosbree
	wil: I am learning by seeing how I get beat...and then trying to avoid that while using what I learned against others.  This lesson is on not letting another corner/monopolize any one economy (action/color).  I am hoping I will teach it well.

	wil: I felt safe having three of one color in my homeworld...because you couldn't get to me.  Anytime anyone trades for a triple three look around, danger is afoot.  Once half you homeworld was gone acess is easier... I sent the small ship in as a tease...and a trojan horse.   I'll play again whenever you are intereted.
