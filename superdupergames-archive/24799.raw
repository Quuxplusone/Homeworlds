1) OnePageWars: Homeworld R2 B1 G3
	OnePageWars: hi again. :)

2) wil: Homeworld B3 Y1 G3
	wil: we's starting fresh....you play a lot of games....I only play this one(here...I play a lot in 3d)...which are your favorites that I shoiuld expand my horizons on?  

3) OnePageWars: Build G1 Onepagewars
	OnePageWars: most of the games I have going on I'm just trying out. Mirador is quick but enjoyable, but I prefer binary homeworlds.

4) wil: Build G1 Wil
	wil: I play a variety of card games and board games, i really think homeworlds is an incredible game of intergalactic chess....it seems to contain all the complexity of chess with some interesting twist as pieces never leave the realm of the game...

5) OnePageWars: Trade G1 Y1 Onepagewars
	OnePageWars: Yeah, it's undoubtedly similar to chess, but I am fain to question if it has anywhere near the strategic depth. I could just be selling it short, though.
 
Have you ever played shogi?

6) wil: Discover G1 Wil B2 B2
	OnePageWars: are there any other viable opening moves besides building a pawn on turn 1 and trading it for a different color turn 2? I guess you could trade the 3 point on turn 2, but other than that?

Move R3 Miranda Onepagewars
Move R2 Wil B2
	wil: should've recreated the g3 in your own system...I am there first so I take it...you'll have to grown the other one...three wasted moves and all your greens go back into the bank and I begin owning the system anyway...of course I will lose my G3 but you will have no big gun....oops it is worse...my move is to abandon Miranda...let you have her...and just move my R3 into your homeworld and take over...I'll give you time to change if you wish....
	OnePageWars: no, go ahead. :) I appreciate the offer, but I don't think that taking back my move would do anything to improve my play.

	wil: carmen she is a growing colony, but her homeworld has been taken over...
	OnePageWars: wp. You're good at this game. :)
	wil: I am learning... I've been beat by the best...(well not the best yet...twoshort holds that title online and I've yet to play him) But Broccoli Commander, TS52, SilentTitan, Zoltar, all regularly beat me and I am learning from them all by the way they move in for the kill...I usually see it too late, and am only now (after dozens of games) seeing what that tipping point is a the middle of the game that starts to shift the power...usually they have won the game essentially long before I see it...it is that one move that takes advantage in the first 8 moves...and then whether they add up, or multiply after that...
	OnePageWars: I guess strength is relative. :)
	wil: Yes, most definitely...defense of your homeworld is imperative.  Did you see/read 'enders game'?  when the homeworld is destroyed, the queen is dead and all is lost...   A key for my learning (beyond the various attacks and tactics) is begin with the end in mind...always be looking as to how to take the homeworld...either take out the stars or take it over..
	OnePageWars: I've heard of ender's game. Sounds interesting. Billboard art reminds me of Pacific Rim, but I have no idea if it's even remotely similar. Is it? without spoilers, if you please. :)
	wil: It is aliens vs earthlings...I had only been recommended in the past.  I don't know of Pacific Rim...
	OnePageWars: Pacific Rim is aliens vs earthlings. Well, regardless, I'll probably have to check out Ender's game eventually unless I am presented with really good reasons as to why it would be a waste of 1.5 hours of my life, lol.
