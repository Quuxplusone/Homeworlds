1) shadowfirebird: Homeworld G3 B1 Y3

	shadowfirebird: Hi!  I'm afraid I'm unlikely to be much of a challenge... Frankly it's just nice to be playing Homeworlds -- I can't persuade anyone else here to play!
	shadowfirebird: I'm new to the site and clicked on a challenge only to find that MikeYarrum hasn't been active for 103 days.
Is there any way you can remove his standing challenges from the challenge page?
	Aaron: I am very sorry for the delayed response, shadow.  Things have been a little crazy over here.  I will suspend his standing challenges.  Thanks, and welcome!
