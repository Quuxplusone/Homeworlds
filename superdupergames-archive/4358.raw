zoltar: The sacrifices are the trickiest thing for a beginner to learn. For example, I just 'traded' my r1 for your r2 with the r1 sacrifice. Yellow sacrifices are the most deadly, as you can move several ships at once or one ship all the way from one homeworld to another to cause a catastrophe. Green sacrifices are good for growing when there are only large ships left of some color.

zoltar: I lost my first dozen games or so, and I set up my icehouse pieces on a table and went over the games of the top players (andylooney and TwoShort are the best, much better than I, even though I happen to have an over-inflated rating right now). By going over their games and seeing the kind of things they did, I soon was able to beat just about everyone but them. That's how good chess players improve, by studying master's games, and it works with this game too, if you have the enthusiasm to do so. As far as I know, this is the only place anywhere that you can find a record of homeworlds games to study.

57) zoltar: Sacrifice G3 Zoltar

Build R3 Blueberry

58) maka: Pass
maka: Yeah. Sacrifices are tricky. I'm not good at planning them well and seeing when they will be good to use them... Thanks for the tips :) I didn't know you could read old games here... I'll investigate it...

maka: So... Do you want to play this game through to the end?

59) zoltar: Build G3 Zoltar

60) maka: Pass
zoltar: Sure, I don't mind playing it to the end -- and you get to see sacrifices and so forth in the endgame. Here I sacked my G3 to get all the remaining red pieces. I can then build my G3 back next move. Or I could do the 'factory', which would have been to sack my G3, build two red pieces (or any other builds) and then build my G3 back in place. In this case it would let you build the remaining R3, so I built all three reds, but when you get a G3 and another green ship on on star and there is no more green in the stash, you can get two builds instead of one with the factory move of sacking your G3 and immediately rebuilding it in place, along with two other builds anywhere on the board. I would have done this last move, but since you threatened to catastrophe my yellow pieces, I had to chase your yellow ship away first.

zoltar: It's the Grand Finale Supernova party at maka's! All ships invited! It will be a blast!

maka: he he :) and you let me trigger the catastrophe...
zoltar: Actually, I was going to trigger both the blue and green together. In a close game, my play here to blow up the two stars one after another, comes in handy: if you wait to sacrifice until you can destroy both stars, your opponent won't have time to counterattack.

zoltar: Play again?
maka: I see...

maka: yeah... I wish the zendo game would also move at this pace :)
