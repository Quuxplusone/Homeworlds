zoltar: Hey if it's ok with you for me to add Gort to the Zendo game (8639), then let Gort know in a comment in that game, as he doesn't want to join unless it's ok with everyone.
zoltar: And I'm not sure what the best move was, but there must have been some way for you to get one of those two large yellow ships. Or maybe trade for a red ship earlier so that I could only build a small yellow.
scottobear: sure, it's ok with me!
