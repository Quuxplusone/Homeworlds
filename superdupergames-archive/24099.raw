26) Marmalade: Build B1 Marmalade

27) SilentTitan: Trade G3 B3 Silenttitan
	Marmalade: I'm really bad at setting up "factory" things - or in managing the stash in general.
	SilentTitan: most beginners are... it's a component of the game that comes with actually playing it and having someone mess you over with it a few times. 
	SilentTitan: to that end.. if you want to pick up this game and start another I have no problem with that... or if you'd like to continue to play this out for the knowledge I have no issue with that either. 

28) Marmalade: Build G3 Quoth
	Marmalade: Oh no, I'm not suggesting I'm giving up! I'd much rather be soundly beaten and have a game I can pull apart later, then abandon it as soon as it looks like I'm in trouble.

	Marmalade: Sorry about the undo, being stupid.

37) SilentTitan: Sacrifice B2 Sol
Trade Y1 G1 Sole
Trade B1 R1 Sol
	SilentTitan: don't worry about undo I am always using that.... the worst part is to make two dumb mistakes in a row.. then you're stuck with the second mistake and for some reason it's always worse the second time.

38) Marmalade: Build Y1 Marmalade
	Marmalade: I suspect that I'm far too behind with this one. This would be my third game, but the third different way of losing, which is good to know :)

39) SilentTitan: Trade B2 R2 Sole
	SilentTitan: Third different way of losing? how so?
	Marmalade: Well, first game against you I think the major turning point was that I just blanked insofar as sacrificing reds worked.
 
The second, with someone else, I lost mostly because of my stack management, but also because I made a crucial error whilst half asleep one morning.
 
This one I've been massively outclassed economically - my actions have been purely reactive, and generally less efficient. You have control over everything, and dominance in most colours and ship sizes, with nowhere for me to excel.
 
You're not immediately threatening my homeworld, but it will take something major to claw back any kind of initiative.

40) Marmalade: Move R2 Marmalade Seoul
	SilentTitan: oh... I was thinking ... in different terms .... you lose by losing the stars in your homeworld or you lose by losing all the ships in your homeworld and I couldn't for the life of me figure out how you could lose a third way. 


41) SilentTitan: Build Y1 Sol

42) Marmalade: Discover Y1 Marmalade B2 Sool
	Marmalade: Do you think it's a little strange to have a text-based interface for this? It works well, and relates directly to the pgn, but given that the options are limited to begin with there's no reason why it couldn't be done with drop-down menus, tick-boxes or whatever.
	SilentTitan: True. however, I also play the chase game on this site and one of the things that bugs me about that game is every possible move for each turn is offered to you on a menu. I'd rather not have the computer show me all my possible choices.
