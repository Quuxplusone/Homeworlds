	Mandrel: Apologies, don't always have time to over as frequently asked I'd like

20) Mandrel: Trade Y2 R2 Adjustment
	bhorner: I understand.  My track record is that I end up not making it back in time and lose on time.  Trying to be better about that.  A 15 move game could potentially take 300 days to complete, that's some endurance!
	Draw5PlayAll: 20 days per move?!?
	bhorner: 10 days per person right?  If you count a move in the game history as both players taking a turn.  That's how chess counts move I think.
	Draw5PlayAll: But still, 10 days per move is unusual. Most SDG time controls are stricter
	bhorner: I think this is a standard ladder challenge, maybe I had an opportunity, but missed where I could change the time controls.
	Draw5PlayAll: Clocks are fixed at 3/3/10
	bhorner: Ah, so we've each just stacked up 10 days of time?
	bhorner: Ok, looked it up, I guess a 15 move game should take less than 90 days.
