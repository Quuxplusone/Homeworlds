TwoShort: Well then, I'll engage in my typical practice of giving new players pointers slightly too late for it to help them :) ...
TwoShort: I'd recommend starting with a green ship; it's easiest, and usually best in any case.
agentofchaos: OK, I'll keep that in my mind in later games (so it will help eventually!)

agentofchaos: That was a clever sacrifice tactic, I'll remember to use that technique to build extra ships.
TwoShort: That's called "the Factory", and it's a big part of why I recommend starting with a green ship. Because if your opponent gets a factory going and you don't, it's really bad... :)

agentofchaos: Clever play. I'm starting to get a clearer sense of the strategy in this game.
TwoShort: Three-pointers are the key; they represent such a huge ability to affect the game that if you can get any more 3 pointers than the other guy you can usually find a way to turn that into victory.
agentofchaos: Well played. Thanks for the playing tips, I'll keep them in mind.
