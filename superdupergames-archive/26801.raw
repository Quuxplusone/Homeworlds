	SilentTitan: Hummel.. I disagree with most of your analysis, but am too short(ha) of time to elaborate at the moment.  Maybe get a chance to later this weekend.

40) SilentTitan: Build G3 Sol

41) wil: B G3 Wil
	SilentTitan: Ok.  I have a moment.  I believe you are a very strong player. As for better or worse than the list of players you provided.  That would remain to be seen.  Too short is by his own admission a very poor performer live.  Broccoli and TTT while they have been very powerful in a relatively short time, I've seen little evidence that they are comprehensive players.  The only player on the entire ladder to win an actual medallion at a tournament (that I know of) is neme and he is currently only passively playing the ladder.  Since the ladder is supposedly weighted like chess the relative strength of a player is supposed to be the value, but I believe that is only part of the story.

47) wil: Move R1 B3 G2
	SilentTitan: Yes and it was my brother in law that had made the challenge,and thereby alerted me to the fact that I was in first. Hence my analysis regarding broccoli and TTT.
