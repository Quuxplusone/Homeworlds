mneme: I don't understand. how do I build a new ship in my home system? b G1 B2Y3 doesn't work. :(

andylooney: you need to give it your system's name, not its description. Try "Construct G1 mneme"

4) andylooney: Build Y1 Andylooney
mneme: Ah! Ok, it just wasn't clear to me, without more examples, that the system name was the thing outside the parenthes! The fact that the system name doesn't appear in the order reports doesn't help, of course.
