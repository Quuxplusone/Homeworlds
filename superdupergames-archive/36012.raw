	Trydnt: Always watch out for the bluebird
	akuden: Ah, I forgot all about catastrophes! Thank you for the game. Its fun and seems like it can get pretty deep.
	Trydnt: yeah there are more possible starting setups than you could make with all the pieces in the set which is pretty wild. I would hazard you against taking green in your homeworld star as it gives your opponent the added ability to teleport ships to your homeworld by sacrificing greens instead of using yellows to move them in which is not a great advantage to give your opponent. Also having the g3 ship from the start makes it more likely you'll be able to access the factory later. If you haven't seen the homeworlds theater episodes on youtube they have some good strategy insights
	Trydnt: catastrophe is the long strategy to win. many games go by without much attacking directly as the most effective way to win is to get two y3 ships and three ships each of your opponents homeworld colors and then sacrifice your y3s to move in three at a time and blow it up in two moves. That's the doomsday machine. You can often hack one together using some y2s and y1s if you have enough though. Then main thing is to make sure that once your opponent has a y2 and a ship in range of your homeworld you gotta keep a close eye on what you grow to make sure you don't open yourself up to having a bunch of your stuff blown up
