	zoltar: I've noticed I've already taken advantage of an early monopoly on Yellow technology: notice you can't build another yellow now that I'm in range to cause a catastrophe.  you needed to grab a y1 early, even if it meant my getting a y2 first, I think.  I don't know that much about openings yet -- it's my weakest part of the game -- but when I see the chance to lock someone out of a color, especially yellow, I go for it. Maybe Yellow is the most important starting color, but I'm not sure.

16) eugman: Discover Y3 Eugman R3 Owie
	zoltar: I couldn't resist!


17) zoltar: Trade Y3 R3 Zoltar
	eugman: I had a plan to deal with the color lockout so I wasn't too worried. What I didn't expect was you using your green and getting me in a position to get a catastrophe. I'll have to rethink a bit now.
	zoltar: got my orders backwards -- anyway, may as well go for the total yellow lockout.  
	eugman: Wait, what just happened.
	eugman: oh ok

18) eugman: Build B2 Kale

19) zoltar: Sacrifice Y2 Kale
Move Y3 Spinach Kale
Move Y3 Kale Eugman
	zoltar: Ok, I'm making a super-efficient move here: I'd usually trade for a g3, but a y3 not only stops you from threatening my homeworld by moving your y3 closer, but it also threatens to win if I get my other y3 into your homeworld (I'd then sac my r3 and gobble up everything in your homeworld).

	eugman: Hmm.
	eugman: Have you ever seen someone win who had at one point no three's?

20) eugman: Pass

21) zoltar: Sacrifice R3 Zoltar
Attack G1 Eugman
Attack B1 Eugman
Attack B1 Kale
	zoltar: I've seen people sac their last 3-size ship for a checkmate.  Usually, if you ever leave your homeworld without a 3-sized ship, you are toast.  That's the number 1 defensive rule.  In your case, you were in big trouble no matter what - you had to trade your y3 back to a green or a red ship to defend your homeworld -- bringing it out now ends the game quickly.
	eugman: Yeah I definately made a big mistake in not changing it back.
