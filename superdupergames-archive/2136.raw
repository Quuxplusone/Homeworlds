Started: 2006.1.10, Ended: 2006.3.15
Participants: twopercentright (S), Lexicon (W), Aaron (N), ts52 (E)
Winner: ts52

1) Aaron: Homeworld B1 G2 Y3

2) ts52: Homeworld G1 B3 Y3
	Aaron: Good luck, all!

3) twopercentright: Homeworld B2 G3 Y3
	ts52: Have a great game everyone!
	twopercentright: bare with me, here.  This is my first ever game


4) Lexicon: Homeworld G2 B3 Y3
	twopercentright: how do i know if i am good or evil?

5) Aaron: Build Y1 Aaron
	Aaron: There is no good and evil in SDG Homeworlds.  We are currently playing the base game which is "Last Man Standing"  There is an "official" variant also supported here called "Sinister Homeworlds" where the winner is the one who eliminates the player on their left.
 
For a training game, this is as good as any.  The goal is just to somehow survive the carnage.  Feel free to ask any questions you may have.  The game is actually quite straightforward once you get the hang of it.

6) ts52: Build Y1 Ts52
	Aaron: I may at some point make the Sinister variant the base game, but for now...
	Aaron: The "Last Man Standing" version is just a little more chaotic.
	ts52: Ah, I was wondering if this was a sinister game or not. I haven't played a "Last man standing" game yet. Should be fun!
And feel free to ask us anything 2%right.

7) twopercentright: Build Y1 Twopercentright
	Aaron: Variants (if any) will appear in the top title bar of the game page, where the game number and rules links are.
	Lexicon: Perhaps the lack of variants should be indicated with a "Standard game, no variants" caption. 
	Aaron: hrm, that's an option...*pulls up the source code*
	Aaron: I agree, I like it.
	Lexicon: Looks good.

	twopercentright: hm
	twopercentright: hm
	twopercentright: I guess it did work.  When i was on earlier, the website froze up, so i had no idea if my command had been exicuted
	Aaron: Remeber, 2%, that anybody can call a catastrophe at the end of their turn.  If you build a 4th yellow, and even if you yourself don't call the catastrophe, Lexicon could.

	twopercentright: how does one get larger ships?  Or is it the whole "use the smallest piece" thing, wherein i can get a larger peice only when the smaller ones run out?

24) Lexicon: Discover G1 Lexicon Y1 Yellowdog
	ts52: You've got it. Building the smallest piece, once all the smalls and mediums are gone. And then trading to get larges in other colors.

57) Aaron: Attack G3S Aaron
	Lexicon: A bit questionable.  You should have positioned better and had another g1 ready to go to launch at him.  As it is, maybe you can convince ts52 to burn a y2 to send his g1 over there.  Aaron is in a pretty tough position now though.

	Lexicon: The site's been down for me for a good bit of last week.  I don't know if that's me or everyone, but Aaron didn't send out a message and all *my* games are expired, so I'm thinking it's just me.
