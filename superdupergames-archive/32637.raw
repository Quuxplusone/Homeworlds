	Felix: I wonder how the dynamic of this position will change since I'm going first instead of second.

5) Felix: Trade G1 Y1 Felix

6) dlwillson: T G1 R1 Dlwillson
	Felix: I wonder. Do you really think the 1-1 star has an advantage? I suppose it's like the banker in that in can block or invest in larges, and like goldilocks in that it can aggressively take mediums. That certainly seems like an advantage over the fortress. But we shall see!
	Felix: I'd be fascinated to see how a game with both players using 1-1 (or 2-2 or 3-3) stars would play out.
