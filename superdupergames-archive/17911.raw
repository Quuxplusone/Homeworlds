Homeworlds Online (SDG# 17911)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2010.11.1, Ended: 2010.11.6
Participants: Remneb (S), ts52 (N)
Winner: ts52

1) ts52: Homeworld B3 Y2 G3
	ts52: Is this your first game of homeworlds? The first move is to create your homewold. When you're the second player, make sure you don't pick the same size pieces as your opponent.

2) Remneb: Homeworld B2 Y3 G3
	ts52: Also, your first ship should always be a large. Although you can choose something smaller, there's no point to picking anything else.
	Remneb: It's my first game.

3) ts52: Build G1 Ts52
	ts52: Ok. You've picked the exact same homeworld as me, which isn't usually a good idea. In Homeworlds, systems are connected by not having a piece in common, so while our two homeworlds aren't directly connected (impossible in the beginning of the game) they're only separated by one jump. Notice, that from our homeworlds, the only systems we can discover are small ones (using the small pieces). Which means once I build a new ship, and move it out of my homeworld to discover a new system, it will be able to move directly from their into your homeworld. This is what we call a small universe.
 
Now, consider if your homeworld was made up of a small and medium pyramid instead. Then you would be first discovering systems using the large pieces, and there would be two hops between our homeworlds.
 
There are probably some strategies that try to use the small universe, but it's not generally recommended.
 
If you want to undo and create a new homeworld, that's fine, if you want to play this one out and see what happens, that's fine too. Just let me know.
	Remneb: Well i choose the same size of star because 2 stars of different sizes are connected...and so bothy systems can be attacked...in my viewing the game of course.

4) Remneb: Build G1 Remneb
	Remneb: Now...if i want to created a new system,i need an extra ship...because in my homeworld,i mujst always have at least one ship ok ?
	ts52: True, you must always have at least one ship that you control in your homeworld. Not quite on the connection part though. Two systems are connected if they don't have any stars of the same size piece. So a 'small star' system is connected to 'large star' and 'medium star' systems, and to 'large medium binary' systems. But not to other small stars, or to any binary system that has a small star in it. So No to binary systems (and only homeworlds are binary systems) can ever be directly connected.

5) ts52: Discover G1 Ts52 B1 Gonzo
	ts52: So after creating your homeworld, the first thing you need to do is create a second ship. (Which is why it's crucial that you always start out with green in your homeworld, either as a star or a ship.)
	ts52: We wont worry about the small universe this game, let's just play it out and then we can play another.
	Remneb: If i understood the rules clearly,a star of a given color-say green-permit to any ship of other colors then green to use the techno of the green star exactly if the ship was a green ship?

6) Remneb: Discover G1 Remneb Y1 Draconis
	ts52: Yes, that's correct. Any ship you own in a system can use the power of the star(s) in that system, or the powers of any ship you control in that system.

7) ts52: T G1 Y1 Gonzo

8) Remneb: Build G1 Remneb

9) ts52: D Y1 Gonzo G3 Kermit

10) Remneb: Move G1 Draconis Kermit

11) ts52: B Y1 Kermit

12) Remneb: Discover G1 Remneb Y1 Khufu Primus

13) ts52: Build Y2 Kermit

14) Remneb: Build G1 Remneb

15) ts52: B G2 Ts52

16) Remneb: Move G1 Remneb Khufu







17) ts52: Trade G2 R2 Ts52

18) Remneb: Sacrifice G1 Kermit
Build G1 Khufu

19) ts52: M R2 Ts52 Khufu
	Remneb: I tried to sacrifice my G3 ship and make 3 moves:g1 Kermit ts52 and g1 Khufu ts52 and so trigering a catastrophe...but the game did not let me do so.What is wrong in my orders?
	Remneb: I've just checked the andrew looney video called "Blue Bird mistake".The sacrifice ship was a yellow one.So if i sacrifice a green ship i cannot have movement in exchange.What do i have instead?
	Remneb: Something else...your Kermit system is not connected to my Remneb system...so i am concluding that you build 3 yellow ship to attack my Khufu system?
	ts52: Aha, in order to move multiple pieces, you need to sacrifice a large yellow. When you sacrifice, you can only use the power of the sacrificed piece, but on any ships you want.
And I'm building up yellow ships to try in Kermit to try and avoid catastrophe. I discovered kermit to take the large green piece out of the pool, hoping to be able to convert it to one of my ships later.

20) Remneb: Move G1 Khufu Ts52

21) ts52: Trade G3 R3 Ts52
	Remneb: So because green ship cannot move from system kermit to Khufu,i sacrified one and build the same in Khufu...doing in fact the same thing.
	Remneb: Do all my ships in Khufu have the power of moving(the yellow star)?

22) Remneb: Move G1 Khufu Kermit
	Remneb: How can you have a red ship when everytime i ask a ship of other color then green,the game told me that i need to control at least one ship of the color i ask.
	ts52: Because you have a yellow star in your homeworld you could've just moved the green ship, but it amounts to the same. All ships in a system can use the power of any star in that system. 
	ts52: I didn't build the red ship using green, I traded it with blue. 

23) ts52: Attack G1 Ts52

24) Remneb: Move G1 Khufu Kermit
	Remneb: Understand thanks.

25) ts52: Sacrifice R2 Khufu
Attack G1 Kermit
Attack G1 Kermit

26) Remneb: Build G2 Remneb

27) ts52: Build G2 Ts52

28) Remneb: Discover G2 Remneb Y1 Phoenix
	Remneb: Here i misunderstood the rule about attacking units(red).I was sure that you have to sacrifice the red ship to turn my green one against me !

29) ts52: Discover G1 Kermit B1 Gonzo
	Remneb: So a yellow ship in a green system can move because he is yellow...and also can be sacrifice to be replaced by an other color?And because there is green and yellow in the same system,we can at the same time sacrifice to replace and move the new ship ?
	ts52: Aha, nope. In fact, as you see, I can sacrifice the red ship to attack ships outside of that system

30) Remneb: Build G2 Remneb
	Remneb: You don't have to sacrifice a red ship in your homeworld?
	Remneb: So a red ship of 2 points can be sacrifice to attack 2 ships of 1 point each?
	ts52: A red ship of two points can be sacrificed to make two attacks. You can attack any ship that is the same size or smaller than your biggest ship in the same system. So if those green ships had been medium (2 point), I could still have attacked because of my medium yellow. But if they'd been large, I couldn't.
	ts52: If I'd sacrificed my red ship in my homeworld, I could have made 3 attacks, but it's never a good idea to leave your homeworld without a large ship in it.

31) ts52: Build G3 Gonzo
	Remneb: I want to understand why you turn my g1 in your homeworld with no sacrifice at all...

32) Remneb: Discover G2 Remneb B1 Menkaura

33) ts52: Build R1 Ts52

34) Remneb: Trade G2 Y2 Menkaura

35) ts52: Move Y1 Kermit Gonzo
	ts52: you don't need to sacrifice to attack. if you have access to red in a system, either because the star is red, or you have a red ship there, then you can attack other ships in that system. you only need to sacrifice if you want to make more than one attack (by sacrificing a med or large) or if you want to make an attack in a system where you don't have red, you can sacrifice a red ship elsewhere to do it.
	Remneb: Understand.Thanks.
	Remneb: We apparently have 20 spectators for our game...

36) Remneb: Build G2 Remneb

37) ts52: Sacrifice G3 Gonzo
Build G3 Gonzo
Build Y3 Gonzo
Build Y3 Gonzo
	ts52: Interesting, I wonder how many of them are actively watching? The last time I tried, it didn't work so well.

38) Remneb: Trade G2 B2 Remneb

39) ts52: Trade Y1 B1 Gonzo

40) Remneb: Build B2 Remneb

41) ts52: Move Y3 Gonzo Remneb

42) Remneb: Move B2 Remneb Phoenix

43) ts52: Trade Y3 R3 Remneb
	Remneb: 12 ships against 4...

44) Remneb: Discover Y2 Menkaura R2 Arcturus
	ts52: yeah, being able to sacrifice a large green, build it back (because there are no more greens in the global stash, and you have another green ship) and then build two more ships it a pretty big deal.

45) ts52: Attack G3 Remneb

46) Remneb: Trade B2 R2 Phoenix
	ts52: you need to be wary about ever having 3 pieces (ships and stars) of the same color in one system. That's asking for your opponent to move in a piece of that color and triggering a catastrophe.
	Remneb: Thanks...i'm trying to do that against you since the beginning of the game lol.

47) ts52: A B2 Remneb

	Remneb: I need an explanation about your last attack in my Homeworld.Few moves sooner,you turn 2 of my ships with a single red 3.Now you turn my g3 bot not my b2? Is it because you don't another ship in my homeworld? 
	Remneb: ...read "is it because you don't have another ship in my homeworld?
	ts52: I could only turn one ship because I didn't sacrifice a ship like I did before. 
	Remneb: Ok.Thanks.If you snap my b2 in Remneb,the game is over.
	ts52: Thanks for the game. I'd be happy to play another.
