	dlwillson: :-) I think you forgot the big rule.
	wil: I forgot a lot... the end was coming fast enough...just thought I'd accelerate it.
	dlwillson: Sure, but you lost back when you sac'd your big green without looking.
 
The "big" rule is that you leave a big at home.
 
The "gun" rule is that when the other guy goes for his gun (a red), you go for yours.
 
There are probably other rules but I can't think of them.
 
And the rules are just rules. You can break with them, but you gotta be careful. :-)
	wil: Oh I agree...I broke them all...but I lost right out of the gates.  Once the early mistake was made it was written on the wall.
I also have a habit of simply moving..and the format is such I can't see the field...I should at least set up a physical galaxy during a ladder game... I look and shoot from the hip way too often.
