4) Twinsen: Build G1 Twinsen
	Twinsen: Let my mistakes teach me by themselves :D. Thanks

5) wil: Trade G1 B1 Wil
	wil: No problem, that is exactly how I learned...first you lose repeatedly...and then you start to see the attacks...then you try to use the attacks and see the counter measures...then you try the counter measures..
	wil: Have you got pyramids at home?

6) Twinsen: Build G1 Twinsen

7) wil: Build B1 Wil

	wil: allowing someone to monopolize an economy can be disastrous...at the beginning of every game it is a challenge of getting larger ships vs. getting one of each color...a game of follow the leader is typical.

21) wil: Trade B3 Y3 Why3
	Twinsen: I have little choice here

22) Twinsen: Move R1 Yfull Twinsen

23) wil: T B3 G3 Wil

24) Twinsen: Move G1 Sol Twinsen
	wil: It is only going to get worse now... warning though... getting a monopoly is always one thing, maintaining one is another.  Easy to get bitten...  in this case I am going to start a large ship factory and then either build a doomsday machine or come in on a full frontal attack.  

25) wil: Build B3 Wil
	Twinsen: I'm not even familiar with those terms. :D

26) Twinsen: Pass
	wil: The doomsday machine is accumulating enough ships of blue and red (the color of your homestars) and yellow to launch them into your homeworld and cause overpopulation catastrophes.

	wil: A full frontal attack or invasion, would be when I send in more large ships than you can kill, and then take over your ships in your homeworld.

27) wil: Trade B3 G3 Wil
	Twinsen: This gonna be quick, I think. :D

	wil: When one imagines the intragalactic battle that you've got yourself in...and sits in the war room, looking at the two warships at near stars around you, and then the flotilla poised to complete the establishment of bases at those outposts.  One must wonder about the purpose of life, their options, and what they were thinking when they decided to antagonize that civilization so very far away.
