26) ZackStack: Build R1 Tango
	rootbier: OMG F ME - I have always always always read the attack rule incorrectly and this is the FIRST time I have ever encountered it in contradiction to my reading. (I have even taught it incorrectly to a couple people ...and I think I might like mine better)
 
I've always played that you could not attack ANY ship in a system if you didn't have size equal to or greater than their largest...
 ...in other words-- that the mere presence of my B3 would be enough to protect my 2s at Tango.
 
I checked the old print-out I originally learned from and I must have misread it from the very beginning. And yet.... huh... how have I been playing so long without that happening before.
 
I feel so confused and lost now. How many games have I thrown away by not attacking smaller ships? How many times have I left myself needlessly exposed? What do I tell the people I have taught. OMG. UGH.
 
I have to absorb this before I can go further.
	ZackStack: Ouch. I hate when that sort of thing happens.  My moment was during my first game on SDG when I realized you couldn't build ships of any color!  Up to that point I felt blue ships/stars were pretty useless...  Feel free to undo your response in light of your new knowledge!
	rootbier: Ha hah. Aren't you the friendliest competitor around. My only justification is ... my friend and I were just so completely perplexed while trying to learn the game off of this piece of paper... something was bound to go wrong.
 
We knew we couldn't trade up - and didn't see how always having to build the smallest available pieces (obivously 1s if you interpret the rules the wrong way) ever got us anything larger.
 
Anyway - I feel rather dumb but actually like my interpretation of attack (it's never led to a disappointing game before) ... whatever. Onward and thank you.

27) rootbier: Trade B2 R2 Gabriel
	rootbier: I sleep now.
	ZackStack: Its a rare game where someone sneaks a smaller ship under a large to steal other ships so I'm not suprised you haven't had it happen before!  I might get a nap if both girls sleep at the same time... ;-)

28) ZackStack: Trade R1 G1 Tango
	ZackStack: Thank you for the competitor compliment as well.  I certainly would have given your moves back in person... so why not on here!
