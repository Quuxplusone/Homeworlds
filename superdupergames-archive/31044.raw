	Felix: You're off to a good start with the colors you picked for your homeworld and starting ship. Choosing the same size pieces as my homeworld will make the playing field be quite small and tight, however.
	WindMillCobra: Thanks a lot for your advice!
	WindMillCobra: I have played one game of homeworlds irl but I am still a beginner 

5) Felix: Trade G1 Y1 Felix
	WindMillCobra: Could you tell me what you think good starting size and color homeworlds are?
	Felix: I think as a beginner, the best starting size and color homeworld is to use small and medium stars in yellow and blue, with a large green ship as your starter. It doesn't matter too much which star is yellow and which is blue. Some people prefer to go with red and blue instead of yellow and blue, which is what I have done here, and it provides defense at home, but it makes it slower to move at first since there are no yellows. It comes down to preference, but as a beginner I think yellow and blue with a green ship is best.
