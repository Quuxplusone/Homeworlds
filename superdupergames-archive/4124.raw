Catastrophe Tuxhedoh Green
	Keith: Forest, jungle, mountains, plains, tundra = Titan/Colossus players in the group?
	Keith: There really is no incentive to attack in this Last Man Standing variant like there is in the Sinister variant.  If I lose a ship in the process one opponent I have improved the position of the other two players against the person I attacked and myself.
	Keith: That should read "If I lose a ship in the process of attacking one opponent...."
	zoltar: Yes, and the Sinister has problems as well. I spoke to the awesome creator of Homeworlds, John Cooper, who said he is still working on an acceptable variation to make the 4 person game work, and that he's not pleased with any of the current variants.
	Keith: Any word on what the problems with Sinister are.  Other than the hazard of finding Zoltar on your left, or worse, your right?
 
Here goes an attack then.  Sorry Tuxhedoh.

37) zoltar: Sacrifice Y2 Plains
Move Y2 Forest Tundra
Move Y2 Tundra Tuxhedoh

38) antihero: Build Y1 Antihero
	zoltar: In Sinister, as soon as one player is weak, the others gang up on the one who can win, and the game can go on endlessly.

39) Tuxhedoh: Build Y2 Tundra

40) Keith: Build G1 Keith
	antihero: I've played some three, four and five player homeworlds before, and we always had the same problem. Clearly, I'm not especially good at the game, but it usually came down to one person throwing themselves into an attack on someone else and leaving themselves weak. If that _didn't_ happen, then the remaining players would quickly gang up on the potential winner. It was still fun, though.
	Tuxhedoh: This is my first 4 player attempt, and I've never quite gotten the hang of sacrificing... or moving from deployment/building/discovering to midgame-attacking etc... but I keep plodding away hoping that I'l learn, I really want the replay feature, it'd be especially handy for 4 players. Of course, being the victim of the first attack has severely hampered me.

41) zoltar: Sacrifice R1 Zoltar
Attack R1S Tuxhedoh
	zoltar: I lost my first few games. Then I went into the archive, set up my IceHouse pieces (you can make your own facsimiles if you don't own a set) and played over every game by the best player (TwoShort). You can't play over the first few of them because of a flaw which didn't record what the starting stars in the homeworlds were, but after the point that that was fixed, I went over all of his games, and of the games of the other two good players (AndyLooney and Jesse). After that, I started to win most games against everyone else, but I've only gotten lucky against Andy Looney and TwoShort once, and they still beat me almost every single game. But I still win the other 90% of my games. Except today -- where a beginner who is an experienced gamer is kicking my butt in his very first game of Homeworlds!
	Keith: Tuxhedoh: I do feel bad about taking advantage of an opening and discouraging you.  I had a Homeworlds game earlier that was so discouraging that I stopped playing Homeworlds for a while.
 
In my case I learned Homeworlds by playing two experienced players, one of them TwoShort, in unrated games where they did not rush to victory over me and made many comments about what they were doing with their moves and why.
	Keith: Tuxhedoh:  FWIW After your move Zoltar is in position to eliminate you from the game by sacrificing his r1 and attacking your r1 with his y2 at your homeworld.  The only way for you to survive past this turn is to undo your turn and build a second r1 at your homeworld.
	zoltar: But Tuxhedoh has neither green technology in his homeworld nor a green piece to sacrifice.  He can however move a piece back to his homeworld. It doesn't do as much good as if he could build another red piece though.
	Keith: Duh, right, no green.  
	Tuxhedoh: Thanks for the tips everyone...
I hadn't thought through other's turns, but had intended to move my y2 back and trade it for an r2. But that's at least 2 moves away.  
	Keith: That would take too long.  I have not moved so you could undo if you want to.  FWIW I had no plans to finish you off.
	zoltar: Unfortunately, Keith's move made Tuxedo's position so weak  that I could finish off Tuxedo the next move, so it made the most sense to do so, as the cost is very minimal.
	zoltar: The only problem will be that antihero will have a very strong position, and control over most of the yellow industry, as Keith and I both weakened ourselves to take out Tuxhedoh.
	Keith: I guess Tuxhedoh is not going to take the undo opportunity.

90) antihero: Move Y2 Forest Zoltar
	Keith: And you have made us both work hard together to bring you to that point.
	Keith: Zoltar, why have you not joined the Homeworlds ladder yet?

91) Keith: Discover Y1 Tundra Y3 Tower

92) antihero: Trade Y2 R2 Zoltar
	zoltar: Because I don't even know what a Homeworlds ladder is. How do I join?
	Keith: Top of this page.  Click on ladders.  I recommend checking out the forums link too.
	Keith: In retrospect antihero and I would have been much better off if we had both flipped a ship red.
 
Zoltar, did you find the forum sections about the ladder system?  Do you understand how it works?
	zoltar: Actually, your flipping your ship red was your downfall! You had two yellows in the system, so you needed to simply build a yellow and blow up my star.
 
And yes I found it and signed up -- I'll figure out how it works as I go, but I've got the basics: challenge the highest person you are allowed to, and beat them, and then repeat the process.
	Keith: Flipping one red was my downfall.  I meant that antihero and I should have both flipped to red knocking out your r3.  Our first plan was to rush in yellow and catastrophe followed by blue.  We did not consult before the last turn and the plan twisted to attacking ship colors and then we went after different colors.  D'oh!
	zoltar: Well you managed to knock out my R3 as I had to sac it to survive. Were there more 3-sized ships flying around the board, that would've been enough to kill me.

93) Keith: Build G2 Keith

94) antihero: Build Y2 Jungle

95) Keith: Discover G2 Keith R1 Eye
	zoltar: Since I was left crippled, I figured if anyone attacked a ship of mine I'd save you the trouble and resign
	Keith: Uhm... okay.  I expected it to take a lot more work and a lot more turns to take you out, and then you might find another mistake (on my part) or opening.
 
As it is antihero has me vastly outnumbered and has the only ship at Zoltar and will easily pick up quite a few more.  Your resignation is a worst case scenerio for me.
	zoltar: What? when you move your Y1 from Tower to Zoltar next move, which you were going to do even if I didn't resign, you will blow up his ship and the yellow star. I was dead in the water. Only if you two, both knowing that, ignored me and went after each other would I have considered staying in the game.
	zoltar: In multiple player homeworlds I always resign if two players gang up on me, and try to blow up my stars with the ships of the weaker of the two in them if I can.

	Keith: Where did you learn that trick?
	Keith: Hmmm.... I don't see where you are going with this.  One of us has a hole in their logic.  Hope its you.

	antihero: yeah it was kind of weird with so many pieces. Not bad, though. I think it really means that once you have an advantage it's easier to hold it.
