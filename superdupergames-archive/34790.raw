36) Babamots: Move G3 Babamots Trill
	Babamots: It don't think your move was too bad. You've extended your yellow advantage, which is pretty important. I scored an additional large, but I'll have a hard time getting it anywhere.

37) AnalogKid: Build B1 Lyese

47) AnalogKid: Move R1 Lyese Analogkid
	Babamots: I didn't notice it until after the catastrophe. The threat of losing half your home is pretty distracting.
	AnalogKid: Well, that makes me feel a little better. :)  I was focused on your G3 ship attacking my ships in the Lyese system which prompted me to use the manuever of threatening your homeworld.  Then I was feeling a little silly that it may not have been your intention to attack in Lyese at all...

48) Babamots: Attack R1 Analogkid

49) AnalogKid: Build Y2 Lyese
	AnalogKid: There is no point in me dragging this out for a few more turns.
 
Well played!  Congratulations. :)


50) Babamots: Attack Y1 Analogkid
	Babamots: I was planning to attack ships in Lyese, but after you sacrificed your y3, I saw at the game with fresh eyes. Looking back, I think my invasion could have worked even while you had your y3, but it would have been dicey if you counterattacked.
	Babamots: Thanks for the game! Good practice for both of us.
	AnalogKid: Well, my hasty invasion certainly made it easier for you to conquer my homeworld instead. I wanted to see what would happen if I took the aggressive approach and I found out just how bad of an idea it was! ^_^  Your monopoly on green may have made it all inevitable anyways.
	AnalogKid: Thanks to you too.  If you want to play another one, I'm game. :)
