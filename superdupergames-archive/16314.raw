	zoltar: As usual, I think I'm utterly lost from the start. I'm almost ready to resign already. I think you can get all the blue pieces and I can't stop you
	jeep: Well, that became my plan. Monopolize blue... We'll see how it goes. I'm baffled by your "as usual" statement. Aren't you (at least) one of the top rated players on SDG? You can't be in this situation too often. And you can't be talking about games against me... I don't think I've beat you at Homeworlds. Or, is it the "think" part that is important? Do you always start off thinking you are losing, but win anyways? ;) 
	zoltar: .
I tend to get the worst of it in openings, even though I often play better and catch up in the middle. I whine the most with TwoShort, who beats me every game (I managed to beat him once a long time ago). So I do pull out of these situations, but I find myself in them with much lower-rated players. I'm always playing catch-up, it seems. This one seems especially bad. I can get reds, but you'll get blues first. I'm just surprised that I'm continuing my streak of getting far behind in the opening. Anyway, it's nice to be playing you again. 
	zoltar: Very good plan, btw, to get the advantage in blues right away, especially as they are the most easily cashed in for other colors, as you don't need a blue star or a sacrifice, as you do with the others. I'll have to try to get creative.
	zoltar: What the?  Damn, as I felt you had the upper hand, I was looking forward to try to catch up and play my best. I guess there's nothing I can do if it's set to 'hard time'. Oh well.
	jeep: *sigh* sorry. I just got too busy. I'm out of the country and have sporadic internet. When I had access, I didn't have time to play. :(
