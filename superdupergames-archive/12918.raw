Homeworlds Online (SDG# 12918)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2009.2.16, Ended: 2009.2.25
Participants: dsheldon (S), xmiyux (N)
Winner: dsheldon

1) xmiyux: Homeworld B3 Y1 G3

2) dsheldon: Homeworld B2 Y1 G3
dsheldon: I see that you've gone with what's called a "Goldilocks" homeworld. It gives you direct access to medium stars. I'm going to go with a "Banker," which gives access to large stars. The general thinking is that the banker is the easiest to play but my personal experience has been an even split of success and failure.

3) xmiyux: Build G1 Xmiyux
xmiyux: I have absolutely no idea what Goldilocks is other than a child in a fairy tale. *laugh* My thought process was that blue and green are both important in the beginning. I like being able to explore quickly so I wanted yellow. And when I was taught the game the person told me it is always best to take a large and a small for your first stars.

4) dsheldon: Build G1 Dsheldon
dsheldon: Goldilocks refers to the size of the stars, not their colors. Because you have a large and a small, your homeworld is adjacent to mediums. Mediums are neither too large nor too small. My homeworld is next to larges. The strategy I will be employing is to discover large stars with small green ships. This will take these pieces out of circulation until I'm ready to build them, stopping you from building them. As far as colors go, you're dead on. Only very extreme strategies suggest anything other than blue yellow and green for your opening.

5) xmiyux: Trade G1 Y1 Xmiyux
dsheldon: Your next move you have a very interesting choice. If you build another g1, you'll give me access to the g2s. Your other choices are to send your ship out exploring or to change it to a different color. Out of the two, I recommend exploration. Early on, since there's no danger to your homeworld, exploration is a very good idea. That, and every step away from home is a step toward your enemy and aggressiveness is good.

6) dsheldon: Discover G1 Dsheldon Y3 Investment
dsheldon: Very good move. See how I can't get a yellow ship at all since there are no y1's left in the stash? (I could, technically, trade my g3 for a y3, but that doesn't seem like a good idea right now.)

7) xmiyux: Discover Y1 Xmiyux G2 Miranda

8) dsheldon: Build G1 Dsheldon
xmiyux: So with the banker strategy you build the small greens, explore the large stars (most likely yellow so you can move the new ship out), and control the access to large yellows?
dsheldon: Here's why my homeworld is called the Banker. Later, when I get some yellow (so not any time soon) I can sacrifice the g1 on Investment, anihilating the star, and then build the y3 wherever I have a yellow ship (assuming there aren't any y1s or y2s in the stash). In the end game yellow is very important because it's very easy to use to set up catastrophes.

9) xmiyux: Build Y2 Miranda

10) dsheldon: Build G1 Dsheldon
dsheldon: Oh no, you don't move the little greenies away, you sacrifice them to /immediately/ build the large. It works for every color but green (you need a medium green to sacrifice because you'll have to build the g2 and the g3 or your investment is sort of wasted).

11) xmiyux: Discover Y2 Miranda G3 Serenityvalley

12) dsheldon: Sacrifice G3 Dsheldon
Build G2 Investment
Build G2 Investment
Build G3 Dsheldon
dsheldon: Ah, now the problem here is that there are a lot of green ships in play, and now I'm going to take the rest of them, which will be a problem for you since you only have one.

13) xmiyux: Build Y2 Miranda
dsheldon: This is a classic move. Sac a green and rebuild it. You might think I should worry about the huge piles of green ships waiting for catastrophe, but since you only control one green ship, and it's alone in your homeworld, I have nothing to fear. You're seeing a prime example of having spread yourself too thin when there were good routes for growth toward reinforcement.

14) dsheldon: Trade G1 B1 Dsheldon
xmiyux: I can definitely feel the pinch on green right now.
dsheldon: Now I'm looking to transform my fleet. I'm going to try and get some of that yellow. I can't swap the 1Gs in my homeworld, and I don't want to give up my 3G because then you could build it. So I'll have to take a few extra steps to get where I want.

15) xmiyux: Build G1 Xmiyux
dsheldon: Now you can build another green ship, which is a really good idea because then you can sac and rebuild the g3 in your homeworld.

16) dsheldon: Sacrifice B1 Dsheldon
Trade G1 B1 Investment
xmiyux: Although had we been being competitive, you never would have given me that green would you?
dsheldon: It's a calculated risk. I'm playing sort of "fast and loose," but I'm not intentionally playing poorly. I needed blue in my homeworld more than I needed you to not have green. Besides, I have more tricks up my sleeve to control the stash.

17) xmiyux: Build G1 Xmiyux

18) dsheldon: Trade G2 Y2 Investment
dsheldon: Now, even when you do sac your g3, between having to build through the g1 I just put back in the stash and rebuilding your g3 ('cuz you've gotta keep that) you'll only be able to get one more build elsewhere (which you could have had anyway from the stars) and you won't be able to build a y3 this turn. Next turn looks a little sticky for me though.
dsheldon: OK, you're just too fast. How's a guy supposed to pontificate if you're making your move while I'm still explaining my last one? ;)
dsheldon: Ah, here's why I can make a good suggestion. If you had instead made this move:

dsheldon: s g3 xmiyux
dsheldon: b g1 xmiyux
dsheldon: b g3 xmiyux
dsheldon: b y2 serenityvalley

dsheldon: You'd be in the same position you are now, but with one more ship. Since I have no yellow there's no danger of me building up to the y3s and you'd be pretty much just better off than you are now.

19) xmiyux: Discover G1 Xmiyux G2 Akers
dsheldon: Check. Watch out! If I "s y2 investment, d g2 investment r2 blah, m g2 blah xmiyux, c g xmiyux" you will lose. So trade or move some of that green.

20) dsheldon: Move Y2 Investment Akers
xmiyux: I knew you needed two moves to get to that system so I knew I was safe for a turn. I'm trying to prevent you from s the g3, rebuilding it and some mediums. On retrospect I should have traded that g1 instead of moving it so there would be at least a single g1 in the stash to make it rougher to rebuild a sacced g3.
dsheldon: Sounds like you know more about what you're doing than you first implied. OK, what I *really* want to do right now is get a y3, but that makes me too vulnerable to catastrophe, and that makes me sad. I think I can still take a good stab at your homeworld though. If I move in my g2, there's not enough to nuke it yet, but you would have a very few options on how to respond.

21) xmiyux: Build Y3 Serenityvalley
dsheldon: Yeah, I decided against it. Discovering that g2 was a very smart move.

22) dsheldon: Build Y3 Akers
xmiyux: Well, i have been simultaneously playing against another total rookie and we have went through a couple games so i am getting more a grasp of the game.

xmiyux: Also, i run an after school board game club for kids and i made them sit down and play Homeworlds with me a couple times so i could puzzle out things. :lol:

23) xmiyux: Move Y1 Miranda Xmiyux
dsheldon: Not a lot to say on this move. I've got to have me that y3.
xmiyux: If you didn't take it i would have tried. :D

24) dsheldon: Trade B1 R1 Investment

25) xmiyux: Trade G1 B1 Xmiyux
dsheldon: Sorry for the delay. Work and family conspired to keep me busy.

26) dsheldon: Move Y3 Akers Xmiyux
xmiyux: No worries at all. Between the beginning explanation and a few other games I have been playing I think I have a grasp of the general game right now if you would rather abandon this one if you are busy and such.
dsheldon: By no means would I want to end the game, I just usually hope to able to play more than one move in four days. That's my apology to you, not a request to be released from the "obligation" of entertainment.

27) xmiyux: Move Y2 Miranda Xmiyux
Catastrophe Xmiyux Y
dsheldon: Moving on with the lesson: now I'm got a three in your homeworld and a red on table. It looks like you'll have a tough time maintaining control of any large ships at home. You never got any red, so you can't take my y3 from me. You could move your g3 away, so that you don't lose it, but then you still won't have any large ships in your homeworld. I thought you might be able to destroy Investment (and my red ship), but you don't have enough yellow in the right places to do that either.

dsheldon: It's a tough position.

28) dsheldon: Sacrifice R1 Investment
Attack G1N Akers
xmiyux: Yep. With your red you would take the G3. Then you my blue star to get a R3 and mate. I was pretty much stuck. I think the game is actually over now, but my only foreseen chance was to kill my own star to take out the Y3.

xmiyux: This connects our galaxies. Unfortunately I axed my own yellow abilities so it will take a turn or two to even get set up. Hypothetically if you sat on your hands without any threats I oculd move a G3 to your base, sac a R2 or R3 if I had them to try to attack.

xmiyux: That, however, is not going to happen. :lol:
dsheldon: Woah, drastic. But I'm still in an awkward position to try any follow up attacks.
dsheldon: Funny thing is, you're one move from destroying my homeworld: s y3 serenity valley; m g3 xmiyux dsheldon; m g1 aker's xmiyux; m g1 xmiyux dsheldon; c dsheldon g. So my first goal is to prevent that.

29) xmiyux: Trade B1 R1 Xmiyux

30) dsheldon: Trade G1 R1 Dsheldon

31) xmiyux: Discover Y3 Serenityvalley G2 Miranda
dsheldon: Allow me to commend your tenacity.
xmiyux: *laugh* Nothing ventured I guess.

32) dsheldon: Build G1 Dsheldon
xmiyux: Almost handed you the win

33) xmiyux: Build Y1 Miranda

34) dsheldon: Sacrifice G3 Dsheldon

Move G1 Akers Xmiyux
Catastrophe Xmiyux G

39) xmiyux: Trade R1 B1 Xmiyux
dsheldon: It's important in your end game to have multiple attack avenues and to limit the possible moves available to your opponent. It is very unsafe for you to build green which is hampering your growth and, while that holds you down, I'm now building up a blue attack in my diversified homeworld. I don't think you need my advice anymore, you seem to have a really good handle on the game now.
dsheldon: Wait... really? You could just *build* a g1, why the trade? And you've opened yourself to an even worse catastrophe. That doesn't look like a very good move.
dsheldon: I guess if you were going to undo you'd have done it by now.

40) dsheldon: Move B1 Dsheldon Xmiyux
xmiyux: Doh - yeah - a complete oversight. I had foreseen that move before. Then turned around and did it again. :lol: Thanks for punishing the mistake. The only way I will learn. :)

41) xmiyux: Pass
xmiyux: Finish me off. I can't bring myself to resign. :lol:
dsheldon: These are among the reasons I wish SDG had an easy way to notify players that you have a game related message for them. I guess I could have emailed you, I have your address... somewhere.

42) dsheldon: Sacrifice G2 Investment
Build Y1 Akers
Build B1 Xmiyux
Catastrophe Xmiyux B
dsheldon: I totally understand your preference to play out a game you've lost rather than to resign, I'm the same way.
xmiyux: Indeed. Well thanks for the game and the help. To be honest I think there needs to be a Facebook plugin for Super Duper so everyone could play through that site.

xmiyux: I also think Homeworlds would make an absolute killer Community Game on Xbox Live. Andy needs to hook up with some programmers and make a little money on that front.

dsheldon: I totally agree. I even downloaded some instructions once, long ago, about writing facebook aps for precisely that reason. I hadn't thought of it as far as XBL goes but that would rule too. Catan and Carcassone are raking it in, how about a little love for the icehouse set?
dsheldon: Always have to finish with a bang. Glad I could help, I think you'll do well, you seemed to really learn a lot and quickly. Just be a bit more careful of catastrophes and you'll be a real competitor.
