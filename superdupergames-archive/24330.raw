	wil: So far I am learning from all intergalactic battles....when I play better folks I get annihilated by various tactics and then try to use these against weaker player and learn how it plays out.  I use them against equal players and see how they defended it vs how I did....but I lose to weaker and beat much better occasionally.....it is such a game of steps...and while you can make one glorious mistake that someone takes advantage of....mostly it is a series of little things that add upto you being in a bad position....and then waiting andsearching for some way to turn the tide..
