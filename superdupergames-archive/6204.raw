Participants: dsheldon (S), wmreed (N)
Winner: dsheldon

1) wmreed: Homeworld B2 G1 Y3

2) dsheldon: Homeworld B3 R2 G3
wmreed: Interesting that the north seat is at the bottom. Or does the game orient itself to me? Hmm. This will take some getting used to. I'm new to SuperDuper, and Homeworlds! LOL.
dsheldon: Yes, you are always at the bottom and your pieces always point up.

3) wmreed: Trade Y3 R3 Wmreed

4) dsheldon: Build G1 Dsheldon

5) wmreed: Build R1 Wmreed
dsheldon: You said you were new to both SDG and Homeworlds, right? Would you like me to try and teach you some strategy? I can't guarantee that it will be great; even though I've been playing Homeworlds for a long time, I don't play it very often.

dsheldon: That being said, I don't think your last move (G3->R3) was very good. Only in very rare situations do you want to do anything but build a second ship on your first regular move. If you're worried about my red star and are trying to defend yourself, don't be. Neither of us has the capacity to begin an offensive yet.
wmreed: Strategy hints will be much appreciated. I'll remember your suggestion here.

wmreed: Not really knowing what to do, I thought that I should have had a red to begin with (an error in my opening), and this was a way to get a large red before the game went too much farther.

6) dsheldon: Trade G1 Y1 Dsheldon
dsheldon: There are several schools of thought on that. Firstly (and the one I subscribe to, generally) is that red is among the least useful colors as it is only useful once you and your opponent are physically near each other. At this point neither of us could easily get our ship near each other, hence red is useless in the early game. All other colors are necessary for sustained growth and, therefore, you want to start with them.

dsheldon: The second school (which I'm trying out here) is that red has great defensive powers as a deterrent. As I have a red star I will always be able to defend myself in my homeworld. I also will probably have a large ship in my homeworld at most points in the game, making that defense even stronger.

dsheldon: The third school (and there may be more still) is that a red ship gives you a jump on the attack. This would probably only be greatly useful if you were able to engineer your homeworld to be closer than normal (say your opponent has a 1-2 world, like yours in this game. if you make a 3-3 world then they are actually adjacent. having a red ship in that case could be very advantageous).

dsheldon: At least, that's how I figure it.

7) wmreed: Trade R1 Y1 Wmreed

8) dsheldon: Build G1 Dsheldon

9) wmreed: Discover Y1 Wmreed B3 Andy

10) dsheldon: Discover G1 Dsheldon B1 Lichen
dsheldon: That was a good change for your last move. Diversification of your Homeworld is a great way to start.

14) dsheldon: Discover G1 Dsheldon B1 Tooth

15) wmreed: Build Y2 Wmreed

16) dsheldon: Build G2 Dsheldon
dsheldon: You're in a pretty bad position here because you don't have any green ships. Early on, green is key because it's how you get more ships. There are also no small greens left, so you can't swap your other small ships to get greens that way. What I strongly recommend you do is build a medium yellow this turn and swap it for a medium green next turn. Otherwise I will rapidly overcome you in fleet size.
wmreed: I see. Thanks!

wmreed: nice move


25) wmreed: Trade R3 Y3 Tooth
dsheldon: Be careful now, losing one of the stars in your homeworld changes the shape of the board. Our homeworlds are now just two moves from each other instead of three.

dsheldon: Also, in case it wasn't already obvious, Catastrophies are the killer move of the game. Unlike Red actions, there's no chance to fight back. Catastrophies let you "move and shoot" all in one turn.
dsheldon: Good move! Way to go on the aggressive.
wmreed: yeah, i know. i was so busy setting up a similar move on you that I wasn't paying attention to how many jumps away you were.
