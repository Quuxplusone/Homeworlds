	Personman: Nicely done. I felt very much like I was walking into a trap the whole time, but was too lazy/stupid to actually sit down and think about what it might have been. That's quite a nice little bind you've got me in, too - I can't see anything you don't have covered.
	Personman: Alright. I've been looking at this for two days now, and I see absoultely no way to even prolong it much, so I shall resign. Good game!
