14) Babamots: Build G2 Babamots

15) Layana: Discover Y1 Vulcan Y3 Risa

16) Babamots: Build Y2 Orion
	Babamots: That's a good move. It blocks me from double-building to get the y3.

17) Layana: Discover Y3 Layana B1 Betazed
	Babamots: Though now you need to figure out how to avoid a catastrophe.
	Layana: If I trade away the y3, you can again build it. If I don't want that, I'll have to move out of the system. The third, theoretical option would be to sacrifice it, but I don't really see what I could gain from that, and I'd lose my only large ship. None of the options sound to jazzy, actually. 

18) Babamots: Trade G2 R2 Babamots

19) Layana: Trade Y3 R3 Betazed
	Babamots: I'm afraid that won't work out since it leaves you open to attack once I get red. I don't see a way out of this for you.
	Babamots: I think your best bet is to trade your y3 for r3 and sacrifice your y1 to bring it home. I get a y3 ship out of it, but you don't lose the game, a star, or a ship.

20) Babamots: Build Y3 Cardassia

	Layana: I think there's nothing much I can do to prevent a Catastrophe in two turns, after which or homeworlds are going to be adjacent, and you will still have your g3. But if you don't mind I would like to play a few more moves nonetheless. 
	Babamots: If I wanted to destroy your yellow star as quickly as possible, you're right that you wouldn't be able to prevent it. But doing that would spend most of my material advantage, which might make it a little easier for you to make a comeback.
 
Here's my longish discussion of "Planning for complete, swift victory"
 
https://jpeterbaker.github.io/homeworlds/site/strategy.html#swiftVictory
 
So my plan is to not attack until I can destroy both of your stars in quick succession (unless of course you give me a chance to win immediately, like if you don't move your large ship home this turn).
	Babamots: I have no objection to continuing the game, especially when I'm ahead ;-).
	Layana: Well, while I feel this is lost already, I still think it might be educational to see how you finish the game. 
	Layana: Well, while I feel this is lost already, I still think it might be educational to see how you finish the game. 
	Babamots: Sorry if that was discouraging. I hope you felt like it was educational anyway.
