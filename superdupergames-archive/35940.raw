Participants: capi3101 (S), Babamots (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) Babamots: Homeworld B3 R1 G3
	capi3101: Howdy again. Looking to see if I learned anything from our last game.

2) capi3101: Homeworld B1 Y3 G3

3) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots

4) capi3101: Build G1 Capi3101
	Babamots: We're off to a similar start :-)

5) Babamots: Trade G1 R1 Babamots
	capi3101: As has been noted elsewhere, the first turn after establishing homeworlds is almost always both sides growing new ships. I've come to consider the true start of the game the point that we're at now...
	Babamots: Don't underestimate the first move. I've lost games where I never really recovered from a poor homeworld choice.
 
But I agree that move 3 is where it starts getting interesting.
	Babamots: Oh, and what I meant about a similar start is that we have the same homeworlds as last game.

6) capi3101: Trade G1 Y1 Capi3101
	capi3101: Interesting move. The conventional wisdom is to get red since you've got red, but since you're lacking yellow it's not as much of a threat as it could be. On the other hand, if you grab the third small I'm locked out unless I can in at the mid level.
	capi3101: I'll wager that I have a ~little~ time.

13) Babamots: Build Y2 Babamots

14) capi3101: Build Y2 Aleph

15) Babamots: Move Y2 Babamots Aleph

16) capi3101: Sacrifice Y1 Aleph
Discover Y2 Aleph R3 Bet

17) Babamots: Move R1 Babamots Aleph
	capi3101: Has anybody done any kind of write-up on when you should and shouldn't squonk? That might be something for your strategy guide. Just saying.

18) capi3101: Discover Y1 Capi3101 R2 Gimel
	Babamots: I'm not sure squonking needs a special section. I think you just need to consider the consequences of the move like you would any other move. How will it affect your material (dis)advantage? Will your opponent want to build the sacrificed piece? I think the strategy guide I have covers general ideas like that reasonably well.
 
Do you have some special ideas about squonking? I'd be glad to hear them :-).
	capi3101: Naw, I'm still very much a beginner at this. Maybe I'll have more ideas on the topic when I gain more experience.
 
In the meantime I've got to figure out how to get into red. The time I thought I had failed to materialize...

19) Babamots: Sacrifice G3 Babamots
Build R2 Aleph
Build R2 Aleph
Build R3 Babamots

20) capi3101: Trade G1 B1 Capi3101
	capi3101: Aw crap...

21) Babamots: Trade R3 G3 Babamots
	capi3101: No, that's really the choice I've got now, isn't it...
	capi3101: But it'd be a slow death move.
	capi3101: If I trade my big green for a big red, in a minimum of three moves you've got enough red at my homeworld to blow the big ship, and then you can walk in at your liesure. 
	capi3101: On the other hand, it's not safe for you to grow red right now.
	capi3101: Let's try this...

22) capi3101: Discover Y1 Gimel R3 Dalet

23) Babamots: Build R2 Babamots

24) capi3101: Build G1 Capi3101
	capi3101: I think I'm doing nothing besides prolonging the inevitable here.

25) Babamots: Move R2 Aleph Capi3101
	Babamots: Yeah, once you get totally locked out of any color, it can be pretty tough to come back. wil has me nearly locked out of blue in our game right now, so I'm suffering a similar fate there. :-D

26) capi3101: Trade G3 R3 Capi3101

27) Babamots: Move R2 Aleph Capi3101
	capi3101: 
	capi3101: Bad situation number two: more ships at my home system than I can capture in one turn. Bad situation number 6 still in effect. I still can't swap for the large red because that would be catastrophe time; I'd be without a large ship or a red ship. 
	capi3101: On the other hand, it'd cost you two reds and a medium yellow, and were it not for your homeworld large, I'd have a material advantage at that point.
	capi3101: I think it's the only choice I've got that makes any kind of sense.

28) capi3101: Attack R2 Capi3101

	capi3101: Eh. That's it.
	capi3101: You move your medium yellow in after the red is blown, and then get the rest of my ships by sacrificing red. 
	Babamots: Yeah, that's the idea. It's good that you were able to see the rest of the game from there!
 
I need to update the section of my tactics page about slow red catastrophes. If you get one turn behind, the slow red cat is still possible.
