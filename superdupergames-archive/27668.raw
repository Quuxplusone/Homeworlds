	Simon: I feel this is a lost game, with 1 large against 4. I should have went for the 3 red ships, even if it's pricey. >_>
	wil: Yeah, I don't have a closing argument yet...but it is a mater of time....although mistakes are made....when I am this far behind I still don't quit because folks are known to be focused on an end game and make a huge blunder.

44) Simon: Move B2 Why3 Geetoo
	Simon: Alright, then I'll play on happily. :)

45) wil: Move R3 Why3 Geetoo
	wil: no force...you can resign if you wish...the other thing I liked about sticking it out was watching the end game...watching how others beat me (ts52 just slaughtered me, like our old game..I was blinded by my scheme and missed the obvious)
