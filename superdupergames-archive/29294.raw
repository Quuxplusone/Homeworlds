	Pheonixian: Hello, you too! This is my first game so we'll see how it goes but I think in any case I will enjoy it.

5) Pheonixian: Discover G1 Pheonixian B3 Eris
	Simon: No problem -- fire away with questions about rules or this implementation. This implementation forbids catastrophe in the middle of a the turn, catastrophe can only occur at end of turn.

6) Simon: Trade G1 Y1 Simon
	Pheonixian: Okay good to know about catastrophes. Is that the standard rule that most people play? Also can one pass a turn or is the pass command only for passing extra sacrifice actions?
	Simon: Pass is to pass one action. You may pass all actions of your turn. I believe this impl has the end-of-turn-only catastrophe merely due to age. Any-time-during-turn catastrophe is the newer ruleset. I don't know what people play in real life, it's advisable to agree. :-)
	Simon: Turns without sacrifice have one action, which you may pass.
