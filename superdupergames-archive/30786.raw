	Draw5PlayAll: Not sure what to do about phoenixian. I want the game to continue legitimately (killing him would make you win by force), but it has been three weeks.

3) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall
	Felix: Hmm. Yeah. I think that's just the risk of 3P and 4P games and there's not much to be done about it. Best to stick to 2P games so stuff like that doesn't occur.
