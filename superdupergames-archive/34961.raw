1) dlwillson: H Y3 B1 G3

2) Felix: Homeworld R2 B3 G3
	dlwillson: Hi Felix! How's everything? It's good to see you! Good luck and have fun, as always!

3) dlwillson: B G1 Dlwillson
	Felix: Hey! A pleasure, as always :) Things are going fine. Quite busy with house, work, children, church, etc etc but we're all doing well. How are things on your end?

4) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	dlwillson: Everything at home is good. SFS is good. Work sucks right now, which really sucks for me, because I usually love my job.

5) dlwillson: Trade G1 B1 Dlwillson
	Felix: Sorry to hear it! Just super busy, or doing a project that's not much fun?
	dlwillson: lack of leadership

6) Felix: Trade G1 B1 Felix

7) dlwillson: Build B2 Dlwillson
	Felix: Gotcha. That's always tough to suffer under. I'm very fortunate to have a great boss at the moment, but I've been under a terrible micromanager before, and that was super stressful.
	Felix: I guess that would be too much leadership instead of not enough :)

8) Felix: Build B2 Felix
	dlwillson: In my opinion, management and leadership are different functions. Leaders are supposed to set clear objectives and priorities. Managers keep their teams healthy and effective in pursuit of the leadership's goals.

49) dlwillson: Trade B1 R1 Field
	Felix: Nice. I saw that coming, but it still hurts!

50) Felix: Build G2 Felix
	dlwillson: You're still way ahead of me, but at least you're not wandering around with an extra large. I think you should've left it yellow. A big yellow in the field with a gun is way better (IMO) than a big red. The mobile threat is better than the free attacks.

51) dlwillson: Trade R3 G3 Dlwillson
	Felix: Yeah, you're totally right. I'm not sure why that move made sense to me at the time.

	dlwillson: Too little, too late. But, let's play it out. Maybe I'll pull off a miracle or you'll roll a 1.

	Felix: Nice! I knew you hade a few turns ago, even though you sounded like you thought you were the one going under :) do you see anything I could have done differently a fee turns back (around when you suggested I roll a 1, haha). I couldn't find any move that wouldn't ultimately open a path of victory for you. I kept hoping you'd miss things, but not much gets past the Willson! Good game and an ending I'll have to study.
	dlwillson: A miracle!
 
I'll have to look at it. I've been thinking that you could have sac'd your Y3 at home, instead of building a Y3. Put in the finishing blue, cat, then put in two yellows with the remaining energy from the sac. But, that wouldn't have worked, because I had mid and big reds all over, and I could have captured your y1 and g1 at home, winning one turn too early for your taste.
Maybe if you'd sac'd your y1? No, you *did* sac your y1. Tell you what: Come to Denver and we'll set up and see if we can find you a path to a win from there.
	Felix: Haha sounds good! I set up my pieces and explored just about every possible path I could go, and they all ended with me being just ONE turn short of victory. I was trying to find a way to stall you by just one turn so I could get that edge I needed, but again, nothing gets past ya.
