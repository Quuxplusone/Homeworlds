mschlat: I'll give. You have more and bigger ships and I can't follow sacrifices. A couple of questions:

mschlat: 1) Why did you build the Bologna system? I didn't see any particular reason for building something not adjacent to me?

mschlat: 2) I keep on being behind on ship sizes. Is this connected to going first? Is this a game where first or second is an advantage?

mschlat: 3) How and where do you learn strategy for this game? I'm willing to lose many games to understand the game better (I did so with go), but I'd like some direction.
MadWuher: I built the other size 2 system thinking that it will connect to yours if I get a yellow catastrophe in your home system and/or a safe haven for me to build up my ships and hold onto some kind of piece advantage. When I was making it, I felt that the size 3 system would be easy for you to get to and attack, thereby losing some of my ships in the process.

MadWuher: I don't think it is a matter of going first or second. I just saw what size 3 ships were available in the least number of turns while sacrificing the size 1 ships when you finally had access to that color. (Maybe that didn't come up in this game, but it's something I tend to think about) As I have read from other players, it is important to leverage the reserve stash by creating some planets and ships at opportune times.

MadWuher: I learned most of my strategy by losing lots of times. It has been stated that SDG-Homeworld players can be too good as many beginners leave the game after losing a few times to the veterans. I found some strategies using the Wiki here at SDG http://wiki.superdupergames.org/games/homeworlds and from the IceHouse Wiki http://www.icehousegames.org/wiki/index.php?title=Homeworlds which has a link to a few strategy pages. I can't think of where else to get help besides the book Playing with Pyramids which includes only a few other tidbits of information you can't seem to find elsewhere. Not earthshaking information mind you.

MadWuher: I hope this helps.
