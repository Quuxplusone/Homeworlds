Winner: Jesse

1) daselva: Homeworld B2 G3 Y3

2) Jesse: Homeworld R1 B3 G3

3) daselva: Build Y1 Daselva

4) Jesse: Build G1 Jesse
	Jesse: Hello, and have a good game.

5) daselva: Trade Y1 G1 Daselva

6) Jesse: Trade G1 Y1 Jesse
	daselva: hello,sorry if I do wrong things...I´m a beginner

7) daselva: Build G1 Daselva
	Jesse: Have you read the tips on the wiki page?

8) Jesse: Build G1 Jesse
	daselva: yes I did...thank you,but reading is different of playing...you will be my first teacher
	Jesse: Well, here's a tip: Variety is good.  That yellow star isn't helping your yellow ship do anything.  A green would let you build more ships, which would be the usual choice for a yellow ship.  A blue star would let you change your ship's color, but that would be more efficiently done directly at the homeworld, or it would be done after you'd built some ships at a green system.  A red would provide you some security against small ships coming for you, but would not help you develop.
 
Discovering a same-colored system like that can be useful in situations where you're trying to keep a color to yourself.  If you were using up the last small yellow, for instance, to make it so I couldn't trade a small green for a yellow.  (That wouldn't work here, though, since I've chosen a red-blue home system in part for the flexibility to trade either the large or the small ship for yellow at this point.)
 
Do you want to stick with your move?  It won't cause anything horrible to happen, but may not be developing quite as smoothly as you could.

9) daselva: Trade G1 R1 Daselva
	daselva: thank you , you are very generous!...are you a lover of homeworlds? what do you think of it? is it a good and « serious» game?
	Jesse: Yes, absolutely.  As Andy Looney puts it, Homeworlds is the True Space Chess.  I think it's an apt comparison of the depth of strategy involved.  But Homeworlds is a lot more to my taste.

10) Jesse: Trade G1 R1 Jesse

11) daselva: Build R2 Daselva

12) Jesse: Build G1 Jesse

13) daselva: Build R2 Daselva
	Jesse: Don't forget about the catastrophe rule.  If there are four pieces of the same color in a system at the end of either player's turn, that player may choose for a catastrophe to occur which sends them back to the bank.  In this case, you now have four greens in your home system, including the green star.  You'll lose those ships and half your system with a move like that.

14) Jesse: Discover R1 Jesse G2 Beeble
	daselva: ok, thank you ,I understood that

15) daselva: Trade R2 Y2 Daselva

16) Jesse: Build R2 Beeble
	daselva: hello.Can you explain me this?...Are there draws in homeworlds? Take this hypothetical situation:I´ve reached the Homeworld of my opponent with a R3 ship.HIs Homeworld is a R1 G3 and the ships in his Homeworld are Y2 Y2 and B1.So if I attack one of his Y2,I will change it to mine.Then he will attack this Y2 and change it to his.Then I will do the same and my opponent to ...etc ...etc

17) daselva: Discover R2 Daselva Y1 Letsee
	Jesse: There is no rule for resolving such situations, unfortunately.  With sacrifices making it possible to perform multiple actions, there's usually a way out of a situation like that, though.

18) Jesse: Build Y1 Jesse
	daselva: thank you

19) daselva: Build Y2 Daselva

20) Jesse: Move Y1 Jesse Beeble

21) daselva: Trade Y2 G2 Daselva

22) Jesse: Build Y2 Beeble

23) daselva: Move G1 Daselva Letsee

24) Jesse: Discover R2 Beeble G1 Bobble

	daselva: hello Jesse, can you help me? ...in the present situation I would to sacrifice the g2 in my HW in order to  build a r2 in my HW and build a r3 in Letsee system butI don´t know how to write these commands
	daselva: I wanted to say«I would like to»...by the way ,what is «carriage return»?
	Jesse: Darn.  Too bad about that time limit.  To answer your question, though, you would write:
 
sacrifice g2 daselva
build r2 daselva
build r3 letsee
 
You could also shorten the commands.  My habit is to write "sac" for "sacrifice" and just "b" for "build".  A carriage return is the character you get from hitting [return] or [enter] on most keyboards.  Basically, you put each piece of a complex command on its own line.
	daselva: Hello Jess thank you and forgive me...it was not timee limit,it was just ...awkward.Trying to find what that «carriage return» was,that I ´ve finally reached that was the changing line button,I carelessly pressed Resignation...I hope to play again whith you one day that I will have more experience (I´ve noticed you are a shark).I will never forget you were my first teacher
