	Aristos: Um... your opening is supposed to be illegal. In a 2-player game, you cant pick the same large-medium-small star pattern. It puts the homeworlds only one jump apart. The official rules say this is illegal. 
	Aristos: We can keep playing, but Im going to flag an admin to take a look to maybe fix the bug for future games. 
	Draw5PlayAll: Where is this illegal?
	Aristos: Admin: in a 2-player game, the home world stars arent supposed to be the same sizes. If player 1 picks large-medium, then player 2 has to pick large-small or small-medium. At least, that was my understanding of the rules. The two systems have to be 2 jumps away. That rule is relaxed in multi-player games. Am I wrong?

5) Aristos: Discover Y1 Aristos Y1 Spark
	deanthebean: I had a look at the rules pdf. I couldn't find a rule against identical stars

6) deanthebean: Trade Y1 R1 Deanthebean
	Aristos: I didnt know about any PDF... just what Id been taught. I went to look up the rules just now... seems I was wrong... matching Id just fine. 
 
Admin:Sorry for the false alarm.
