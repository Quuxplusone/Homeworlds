Participants: Felix (S), dlwillson (N)
Winner: dlwillson

1) dlwillson: Homeworld B3 R1 G3

2) Felix: Homeworld R2 B3 G3
	dlwillson: Yay! Another game with Felix!
I think I'm going to go blue/red in serious games, from now on. It just seems slightly more useful under various conditions.
	Felix: Hooray! I always enjoy our games, and this one is high stakes, so even better! I'm honestly still torn over whether I prefer red/blue or yellow/blue.... I flip back and forth a lot on which is better.  Red/blue is probably better for defensive play and slowly amassing a powerful fleet, while yellow/blue may be a bit better at quickly expanding and diversifying and even attacking with some little jabs early on. Hmm... now I must decide.

3) dlwillson: Build G1 Dlwillson
	Felix: And there you have it. I think blue/red might be a bit stronger as a fortress, while yellow/blue is stronger as a banker.
	dlwillson: Hm... That might be a good summary. But, I think of banker as a defensive position. I think goldilocks is the most aggressive.

4) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	Felix: Interesting! I was under the impression that the fortress was a bit stronger in defensive play, since it generally requires you to go through small stars to get to my system, and small stars tend to run out in the endgame, whereas larges are typically available in the endgame, so there are more options for attacking a banker. I agree with you that Goldy might be the most aggressive though

5) dlwillson: Trade G1 Y1 Dlwillson
	Felix: I thought about attempting a 2-2 homeworld to make this a very tight and interesting game, but I'm not sure I'm brave enough to attempt that in a ladder game.

69) dlwillson: Sacrifice Y1 Field
Move R3 Forest Quadrilat
	dlwillson: I didn't set up the plastic, but by my guess, if I hadn't done that, the game would have been over in two or three turns. Hopefully, it will take longer now.

	Felix: It will indeed. But I really can't tell if it will go your way or my way at this point! I am managing to hold on... and I hope that last moves puts you in a bit of a fix!
	Draw5PlayAll: I still have not been defeated legitimately in OTB Homeworlds. I think that says more about the nature of this game and its very low acknowledgement, even among gamers.

73) dlwillson: T G3 B3 Sea
	dlwillson: What is OTB Homeworlds?
	Felix: Wait, wait... I wanna take that back! Haha, ugh. I can't believe I  made such a rookie blunder at this crucial point. I totally overlooked that you could attack in two places, thinking you"d have to give up the r3 to dodge the green catastrophe at home.

	dlwillson: Yeah, I figured something like that, so I waited an hour for you to realize and take it back. 2 or 3 more turns.
	dlwillson: 6 more turns. 3 each.
	Felix: We could play it out, but I'll just save you the time and trouble. Good game! And no need to wait for me to realize mistakes. Just take advantage of them! And.... "I'll be baaaaaaaaaack!"
	dlwillson: Great! I look forward to it!
 
Draw5: What is OTB Homeworlds?
	Draw5PlayAll: Over the board, I.e. face to face
	Felix: Same here! Our games are always a blast, even if I'm really kicking myself for how I played in this one.
 
Draw5: it might also speak to how experience your Face-to-face opponents are :p
