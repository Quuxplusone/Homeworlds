agentofchaos: Yes another player recommended this game to me based on my liking of chess variants. i also like space themes, so that's good too. Any strategy tips would be welcome.

10) Jesse: Build Y2 Jesse

11) agentofchaos: Discover Y1 Wendigo B1 Freehold
Jesse: The games require similar skills, have similar issues of attack and defense, and have similar scope in space and piece variety. Yet, they do no feel the same to me. Homeworlds feels more strategically driven, with most of the decisions being decided on fuzzy reasoning about trade-offs of strengths in different areas. Chess has sharper decisions, I think. They are still more similar than, say, Chess and Go. It's more the Chess variants that make me think you are likely to enjoy Homeworlds than Chess itself. It shows you like different things in roughly the same vein.

Jesse: As for strategy tips, let's start with this: To avoid catastrophes, you generally want to spread out your ships of the same color, and diversify the colors in any given system. It's harder and much more expensive for your opponent to drop two ships into your system to cause a catastrophe than it is for him to drop in one, and it's harder and more expensive still to drop in three. Spread and diversification of your ships also improves your economic strength. Control of the global stash economy is sort of like control of the center in Chess. It gives you the strength and flexibility to do what you want. Without it, you are forced into awkward positions from which it is difficult to gain the advantage.

12) Jesse: Discover Y2 Jesse B2 Bloom
agentofchaos: Thanks for the tips, the analogies with chess are quite interesting.

13) agentofchaos: Build Y2 Wendigo

15) agentofchaos: Trade Y3 G3 Agentofchaos

16) Jesse: Move G1 Jesse Bloom

17) agentofchaos: Move Y2 Wendigo Freehold
Jesse: Careful with that. Four pieces of the same color can trigger a catastrophe. If you build another green, that makes three, and I now have a g1 two steps from your homeworld, which means I can get it there in one turn with a y2 sacrifice.
agentofchaos: Thanks for the heads up. deeper and deeper... :-)

18) Jesse: Build Y2 Bloom

19) agentofchaos: Trade G3 Y3 Agentofchaos

Jesse: There is an ancient Homeworlds proverb: When your opponent picks up a gun, you should pick up a gun. It refers to not leaving yourself vulnerable to capture when your opponent gets a red ship.

24) Jesse: Build G2 Bloom
agentofchaos: Sounds like a wise proverb!

28) Jesse: Discover G2 Bloom Y3 Tide
