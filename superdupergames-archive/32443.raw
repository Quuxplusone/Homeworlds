	Ausmuh: Just saw your message after I accepted. I'm not too worried about my rating at the moment but I appreciate the thought. Have fun. Don't feel obligated to play 'standard' if you don't want to. It's all good to me. Have fun!

3) Ausmuh: Build B1 Ausmuh
	Felix:  Yeah, I'm not too worried about ratings either. If my sense of self worth is determined by an arbitrary number on an online game website, I have bigger problems to worry about :p  and I usually start with a large green shit, so this is fairly non-standard for me. We'll see how it plays out! Have a good game!

	Draw5PlayAll: About Felix's second comment: that is one of the thing I most hate about curse words: a lot of them are one letter away from perfectly honest and acceptable words.  
	Felix: I'll be camping tonight until Saturday morning, so my apologies for not moving until then!

	Felix: Ah, yes, that's what it was. I hope this works!
	Ausmuh: Ah! Maybe, I think you might need an r2 here.
 
I'll take a 3pip
You take my R3
I sac to take R3
You sac to take R3
 
Wait a minute...... Here we go!

30) Felix: Move B3 Ausmuh Felix
	Ausmuh: This is a interesting situation. I will be putting this one down in plastic to stare at some time. :)

31) Ausmuh: Trade B1 G1 Ausmuh
	Felix: Wait a second. That didn't work at all :P Retreat! Retreat!

32) Felix: B Y2 Felix
	Ausmuh: Ugh. Hindsight is 20/20.
 
Too bad for me that I can't just move in my yellows. Homeworlds can be quite delicate. Hopefully I don't waste my newly acquired advantage.

33) Ausmuh: Build G2 Ausmuh
	Felix:  Indeed.  Looking at a situation before you move and after the move can be totally different  animals. I do have a very steep hill to climb up nowÂ… But anything can happen! :-)

Pass
	Felix:  If I had traded for an hour or two, you could've just built that  last green right away and finished off my star. As it is, I think I only delayed the inevitable a turn. Good play!

Attack Y2S Felix
Pass
Pass
	Felix:  I'm game! Very well played. 
	Felix:  Good game* 
	Ausmuh: Thanks, good game! The self destruct didn't work out this time but still a clever thought! 
	Felix: I like to try to think outside the box sometimes. Sometimes it pays off.... sometimes it doesn't!
