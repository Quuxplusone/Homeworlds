Catastrophe Dadrk Green
	MikeYarrum: You may want to undo that move. Now that you have four green pieces in a system, I can cause a catastrophe at the end of my turn.
	MikeYarrum: Sorry - waited as long as I could.

	DaDRK: I actually thought I undid that, oh well
	DaDRK: well good game I don't think I can do much now, thanks for the game even if I did such a stupid move.
	MikeYarrum: I was worried you had left the site, as many sometimes do. It's best to just start a new game when an old one goes sour.
