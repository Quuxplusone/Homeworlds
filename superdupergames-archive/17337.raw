	dlwillson: I can capture that r2 for free, with my g3. You probably want to do something else. Build a y2 maybe or trade into green.
	dlwillson: Or, build another red. But rushing me with an R2 when I have a large and red in the system, does seem to make sense at this point.
	dlwillson: It would make sense if you had a bunch more red, maybe. No...  not even then, because if you did, I'd sac my R1 to attack your R2, even though I don't need to, in order to keep my red count low and avoid a potential catastrophe. You can't get anything good from this move right now. And maybe not ever.
