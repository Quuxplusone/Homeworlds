Homeworlds Online (SDG# 3298)
Started: 2006.4.28, Ended: 2006.6.5
Participants: babelfish (S), dralius (N)
Winner: dralius

1) dralius: Homeworld B3 G2 Y3 *
	dralius: I am a true novis when it comes to homeworlds. But I do know someone who is not so let's ask for some tutoring.

2) babelfish: Homeworld G3 B1 Y3

3) dralius: Build Y1 Dralius
	babelfish: I hate reading the rules!
	dralius: I have asked a friend of mine to advise us but i guess he has not been on in a few days.


4) babelfish: Build Y1 Babelfish

5) dralius: Trade Y1 R1 Dralius
	babelfish: Well, I guess I'll just keep doing what you do. :)
	dralius: That may be ill advised
	dralius: in fact i am sure of it.

6) babelfish: Build Y1 Babelfish
	dralius: This game is extremely oblique. Everything you need to accomplish requires you to do something else first to prepare for it including preparing for the action you with to take. 

7) dralius: Build R1 Dralius

8) babelfish: Trade Y1 R1 Babelfish
	babelfish: You're looking awful hostile.

9) dralius: Discover R1 Dralius G1 Boogie

10) babelfish: Discover Y1 Babelfish G2 Tweety
	babelfish: oh crap, what do i do now?

11) dralius: Build Y1 Dralius

12) babelfish: Build Y1 Babelfish

13) dralius: Trade Y1 B1 Dralius
	CDRodeffer: Howdy! Dralius invited me to kibitz here, said it's a teaching game. Is it OK if I offer some suggestions?

14) babelfish: Build Y1 Babelfish
	babelfish: PLEASE DO!!

15) dralius: Move B1 Dralius Boogie
	CDRodeffer: Babelfish, you're vulnerable to a yellow catastrophe in your home system and are also in danger of being locked out of the blue economy. Dralius could, in three moves, move his small red ship from Boogie to tweety, attack your small yellow ship there, then move it into your home system to trigger a catastrophe. To prevent it, you might want to either build a medium yellow ship in tweety (to prevent the attack and assure access to medium ships) or trade one of your small yellow ships in babelfish for a small blue ship. Both will buy you time to get into the blue economy, which is important for defense against and, later, for triggering timely catastrophes. But it's Dralius' turn now. You might want to either set up the attack outlined above, or possibly build another small blue ship in Dralius. That would make three blue elements in you home system, but you have tempo now, and babelfish couldn't immediately move in for a catastrophe. To protect your home system, you might then want to trade one of the small blue ships in Dralius for a small green ship to gain access to mobile building technology, especially since green pieces are quickly being depleted. Getting a large green ship and another green ship of any size in the same system (preferably one without a green star) is an investment for the future that will eventually (once the rest of the green pieces are gone) become a "factory", enabling you to build twice as quickly by sacrificing the large green ship, rebuilding the large green ship right where it was, and then building two other ships in any other systems you occupy.
	dralius: WOW i could do all that!?!

16) babelfish: Trade Y1 B1 Babelfish

17) dralius: Build R2 Boogie
	CDRodeffer: At this point, you both should probably be thinking of building some of those freshly available medium ships. Dralius might be especially interested in getting a medium red ship in Boogie to go after whatever babelfish can get to tweety before Dralius takes it over. I'm sorry, but I don't see any reasonable defense against that now. Moving the large yellow ship from babelfish to tweety would let you keep that system, but it would leave your home system very vulnerable. Alternatively, babelfish could build a medium red ship in babelfish, then move it to tweety on a turn when Dralius has something dire elsewhere to accomplish. This would set up, to borrow from Go, a "ko threat" in tweety.
	dralius: I'll take that advice. 


18) babelfish: Build R2 Babelfish

19) dralius: Trade R1 Y1 Boogie

20) babelfish: Move R2 Babelfish Tweety

21) dralius: Discover R2 Boogie Y2 Chacha

22) babelfish: Move R2 Tweety Boogie
	CDRodeffer: Babelfish should note that Dralius' R2 in ChaCha is only one step away from the babelfish home world. It's OK for now -- even if he invades, you can attack and take over his R2 before he has a chance to attack any of your ships, and he would be unable to attack your Y3 in any case. However, you probably DON'T want to immediately build another blue or yellow ship in your home system. If you did, it would make the third element of either of those colors. Dralius could then move the R2 to babelfish and, if you don't immediately attack it, sacrifice the B1 in Boogie to change its color to either blue or yellow (whichever you just build) and trigger a catastrophe. This would cost you either your Y3 flag ship or your B1 sun, neither of which would be a very happy prospect. Fortunately for you, Dralius cannot immediately build a second ship in ChaCha. If he were able to build a second ship there, and if he were able to build a Y2 in either Boogie or Dralius and sacrifice it to move both ships into babelfish, you'd have to sacrifice your R2 in tweety to save yourself. Now, what can you do to prevent all that bad stuff from happening? Hint: Try causing a distration elsewhere to which Dralius has to respond. Where and how is he vulnerable?

23) dralius: Move B1 Boogie Chacha
	dralius: Oh man what a day i had. I will delay my move until i get some rest.

24) babelfish: Trade Y3 R3 Babelfish

25) dralius: Build Y2 Boogie
	babelfish: Brian helped me with this move.  Do you think it is a good one?
	dralius: That may put you in danger of a disaster. Heck i am no expert, just winging it as i go.
	CDRodeffer: I don't believe that babelfish is in any immediate danger from a disaster due to trading the Y3 for R3. On the other hand, I don't really understand why babelfish made that exchange now, when other moves may have given you more of an immediate advantage, such as build y2 tweety or build y2 babelfish. Build b2 babelfish would have been clearly bad, however, because then Dralius could have done move b1 ChaCha babelfish catastrophe blue. Actually, Dralius could still work toward such an attack, and have it in three if babelfish doesn't do something to prevent Dralius from doing build y2 Dralius, build b2 ChaCha, sacrifice y2 Dralius move b1 babelfish move b2 babelfish catastrophe blue babelfish. Or even more damaging, Dralius could build y2 Dralius, build r1 ChaCha, sacrifice y2 Dralius move r1 ChaCha babelfish move r2 ChaCha babelfish catastrophe red babelfish! It's imperitive that you do something to defend against one of these. There are two paths, each taking three turns, so babelfish has at least one extra tempo to get it done. One thing that would delay this would be to somehow get a y1 back in the stashes to prevent Dralius from building y2.
	dralius: Just too much to think about in this game.


26) babelfish: Attack Y2 Boogie
	bigby: I thought that the 3 ship had to be red in order to attack dralius if he entered babelfish.  But after reading the rules again, You just have to have a red ship in the sector in order to attack, correct? so babelfish's Y3 could turn back dralius' R2 as long as babelfish leaves R1 in the system? 

27) dralius: Build R1 Dralius
	babelfish: i need an inordinate amount of help to play this game.

	bigby: That's okay.  We all need to learn it before the triathalon!
	dralius: It is unlikly that i will understand how to play by the 28th.

28) babelfish: Build R2 Boogie
	babelfish: I am definately out of the tri.  I'd love to do the first one suggested (cannon, pulling strings, fortac)

29) dralius: Build Y2 Dralius
	dralius: No new Cannon until it's fixed :(

30) babelfish: Move R2 Boogie Dralius
	babelfish: No Cannon nor Fortac?  What's a girl to do?
	dralius: Storm the gates!!
	babelfish: Brian proposed on Friday night.  Woo hoo!
	dralius: Congratulations.
