	Babamots: Would you like any advice about your moves? Since you've taken the last medium blue, you've opened up the larges for me to build (getting more larges is a big deal). Since "sigma" is crowded with blue already, you won't get to build a large to stay even with me.
	Babamots: You're welcome to undo and try something else if you like.
	Babamots: Trading one of those blues for a red or yellow might be better.
	Babamots: In particular, I think I would have suggested trading the b2 for a y2. That way, if I try to greedily sacrifice my g3 to build three blues at once, you could sacrifice the y2 to move your remaining b1 to cause a catastrophe on me.
	Babamots: Well, it's been a couple of days, so I guess I'll just move. I'm perfectly happy to take a b3, thank you :-).

13) Thorolf: Trade B2 R2 Sigma

14) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots

	Babamots: Is everything OK? Looks like you've disappeared.
