5) SilentTitan: Trade G1 Y1 Silenttitan
	wil: I don't think I've gone terribly wrong yet...   
	SilentTitan: Ha.... I think you're right.  

6) wil: Trade G1 Y1 Wil
	wil: I'd appreciate when you see me make what you would consider a poor move or a grevious mistake to point it out (take advantage of it by all means) but tell me where I went wrong and why...  I seem to make some biggies, but some small tactical ones that lead to a cumulative disadvantage that I don't understand....twould be appreciated...

7) SilentTitan: Build G1 Silenttitan
	SilentTitan: ok.. I will be glad to do that.

8) wil: Build G1 Wil
	SilentTitan: first I will be building up... trying to get to a position where I can use the G3 to my advantage.  Also I like to corner the yellows as you well know.  Additionally, I'm manipulating the bank so as to try putting you into making a bad selection, one that would allow me to get a 2-pip build and have you unable to because it would put you in danger of a catastrophe.

	SilentTitan: ok.. I undid this move and I feel I need to explain.  If you use your pyramids to process the turn I've backup up from.. you should see that you'd have been able to sac your y3 in wil and run both the yellows from g3 and r2 into my homeworld and cause a cat thereby winning you the game. 

41) SilentTitan: Sacrifice G3 Silenttitan
Build G1 Sol
Build G3 Tic
Build G3 Silenttitan
	wil: color me confused?  won the game?  I would have only killed your yellows..you'd be left with a binary star and a g3 and my I'd have zero queen ships...

42) wil: Build Y2 G3
	SilentTitan: North's ship G3 was sacrificed in the SilentTitan system. North created a Y2 ship in the SilentTitan system. North created a G2 ship in the sol system. North created a G3 ship in the tic system. 
 
was the turn I undid.  in this case you can see I sac'ed the G3 in my homeworld and built a y2..  so at that point only the y1 and y2 were in my homeworld.

43) SilentTitan: Move Y2 Soul G2
	wil: ok, I missed the I would have been able to...I read it wrong and thought you were referring to what I should have done....btw I just lost a physical game to that very bluebird mistake!!  aaarrggghhhh
