	mneme: um.  I think I may have gotten my own back for the blunder on move 16.  And then some.
	goulo: Yeah...

46) mneme: Trade Y3 G3 Mneme

47) goulo: Build B1 Smeraldeto
	goulo: My problem in Homeworlds is I can see and take opportunities like move 16, but I still don't have a good sense of long-term strategy and don't create such opportunities reliably enough, and fall into them on the wrong side of the opportunity like just now. :)

48) mneme: Build Y3 Mneme

49) goulo: Move Y1 Goulo Smeraldeto

50) mneme: Move Y3 Gunther Citroneto
	goulo: Hm, OK, now I'm just playing like an idiot. Time for a break. :/
	mneme: Yeah, I was wondering about that one; it was pretty easy to deny it.
	goulo: It was pure brainfart at my end - no idea how I didn't notice "Oh, gee, he'll just build the last Y3."
	goulo: one mistake compounding another

51) goulo: Move R1 Citroneto Rubenego
	goulo: looking at the situation now - your 3 big ships vs my 1 big ship - it is hard to imagine that a few turns ago, i was ahead. talk about snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. :P
well, i'll press on for a bit. :)

	goulo: Thanks for the game - no point in my further floundering...
	mneme: *nod* Sorry I didn't bring it to a conclusion faster; I kept having great opportunities for further locking you down that I took instead of, say, s y1 mneme, m Y3 Rubenego Smeraldeto, followed by t Y3 B3 Smeraldeto and a Y sac to put both ships in your homeworld.
	goulo: No need for you to apologize for being careful when you're ahead. :)
That was an interesting tough game for me. Well, there's a reason your rating is higher than mine. :)
	mneme: Fair enough.  Twoshort can reliably beat me; I can't think of anyone else who can.  It was interesting for me too, as I was on the verge of surrendering when you knocked out my only large--but I figured you didn't have a knockout blow, so it was worth continuing to play and hope you'd let me get a large back in exchange for your getting a large (as you did).
