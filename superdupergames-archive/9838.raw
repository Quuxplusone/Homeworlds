TwoShort: Yeah, moving out before you grew a second one just put your only spot to grow yellow closer to me without helping you particularly. The competing-monopolies situation we were heading into demands growing efficiently while not getting blown up.

wyons: oh--- and after my move it came back! :)
TwoShort: I didn't mean to blow off your suggestion of a game of grim reaper - I'm just a bit short on attention cycles at the moment... issue a challenge in January and I'll be happy to play. Also, I'm not sure "polishing you off" is quite where this game is at :) Someone (Steely-eyed Russell?) once referred to monopolizing yellow to the point that you have nothing else as "the sand trap", but this is the first time I've understood what he meant. Anyway, I mention it just to point out my dumb golf reference: Using a Wedge to get out of the sand trap. Now on to the green...

31) TwoShort: Trade Y3 R3 Bluonia
wyons: no offence taken. I shall challenge you to GR in January.
wyons: ...and I still feel like I have barely a head above the sand.
