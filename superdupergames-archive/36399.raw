Homeworlds Online (SDG# 36399)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2020.5.6, Ended: 2020.5.13
Participants: Babamots (S), capi3101 (N)
Winner: capi3101

1) capi3101: Homeworld G1 B3 Y3
	capi3101: Hello again.

2) Babamots: Homeworld B2 G1 G3 *
	capi3101: I was running low on active games...I've got four going on right now and two of them are against players who haven't moved for more than thirty days. I'd terminate the games but with the quarantine going on I figure there's the off-chance my opponents have more important things on their minds...
	capi3101: I suppose it's possible that they don't realize it's been their turn for a month. Doesn't strike me as likely though.
	Babamots: Sometimes you can get people's attention by clicking the "Call an Admin" button. Unless they've changed their settings, they'll get an email about the game. And Aaron the Admin isn't actually responding to the button anymore, so it's just a "pause game time and notify my opponent" button.

3) capi3101: Build Y1 Capi3101
	capi3101: I don't know why I wouldn't be concerned about an Instafreeze on green...the last two games I've won have been via green ships...

4) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots

5) capi3101: Trade Y3 G3 Capi3101
	capi3101: Though if I were overly concerned, a small red star would probably be the best defense against the insta-freeze strategy, with yellow second. Just an observation.
	Babamots: Well, if you've been reading my guides, you'll know how to deal with an instafreeze, right? :-)
	capi3101: Yep. Like that.
	Babamots: It looks like the site is having some kind of problem. I see your move listed in the log, but I have an "Undo" option rather than a command entry box. What does your page look like?
	capi3101: Looks like I didn't move over here.
	capi3101: Still got a y3 at my homeworld instead of a g3.
	capi3101: I'll try resubmitting.

6) Babamots: Trade G3 Y3 Babamots
	capi3101: Got a game of Zendo going on where things got wonky just yesterday...number Zendo, but apparently an opponent of mine submitted a koan (VirtuaGirl) or something like that.

7) capi3101: Build G2 Capi3101
	capi3101: Looks good now.

8) Babamots: Build G2 Babamots

9) capi3101: Discover G2 Capi3101 B2 Zulu

10) Babamots: Trade G1 R1 Babamots
	capi3101: Mixing it up this time - going NATO phonetic in reverse...
	capi3101: Because that end of the alphabet never gets any love.
	Babamots: Which Zendo game are you talking about? You're in several and I don't see a opponent name that looks like "VirtuaGirl."

11) capi3101: Trade Y1 R1 Capi3101
	capi3101: That wasn't an opponent name...it was supposed to be a koan. All the more weirder since it's a number Zendo game. #36257
	capi3101: Ugh. Red.

12) Babamots: Build Y1 Babamots
	capi3101: No...I want to be able to sac it.

13) capi3101: Build G1 Zulu
	Babamots: If koans are supposed to consist of numbers, I think the master should say that text submissions aren't valid and reject the koan.

14) Babamots: Discover G2 Babamots B3 Bolarus
	capi3101: They did; the player in question couldn't figure out how that got submitted for them in the first place, though...

15) capi3101: Trade G1 Y1 Zulu

16) Babamots: Move Y1 Babamots Bolarus

17) capi3101: Build G1 Capi3101

18) Babamots: Sacrifice Y3 Babamots
Move G2 Bolarus Zulu
Move G2 Zulu Capi3101
Catastrophe Capi3101 G
Discover Y1 Bolarus R1 Romulus
	capi3101: Sorry for the delay...was weighing a likelihood.

19) capi3101: Sacrifice G2 Zulu
Build R2 Capi3101
Build R2 Capi3101
	Babamots: Hardly a delay. I think of one move per day as the standard on SDG.
	Babamots: I'm intrigued by these positions where someone can choose to destroy an enemy home star but leaving themselves vulnerable. I usually say it's a bad idea, but it's always tempting.

20) Babamots: Build R2 Babamots

21) capi3101: Trade R2 Y2 Capi3101
	Babamots: Not sure if this will work out for me, but we'll see.
	capi3101: Well, so much for weighing likelihoods...

22) Babamots: Trade R1 Y1 Babamots
	capi3101: I hate small battlefields.

23) capi3101: Trade R2 G2 Capi3101
	Babamots: Microverse will keep you on your toes, that's for sure.

24) Babamots: Discover Y1 Romulus G3 Orion

25) capi3101: M Y1 Zulu Orion

26) Babamots: Build R1 Babamots

27) capi3101: Build R1 Capi3101

28) Babamots: Sacrifice R1 Babamots
Attack Y1 Orion
	capi3101: I know making moves at 1:45 AM is a bad idea...I dont know ~why~ I keep on doing it...
	capi3101: Tonight its the weather. Bit loud out there right now.

29) capi3101: Build R1 Capi3101
	Babamots: I had to make some rules for myself: no late night moves, no moves while getting ready for church, no moves on my phone to stave off boredom.

30) Babamots: Build Y2 Babamots
	Babamots: Thought I saw a problem with this move but now I can't think of it, so what the heck.

31) capi3101: Build Y2 Capi3101
	capi3101: Those are some good rules; might have to implement them my own self.

32) Babamots: Build Y3 Orion
	capi3101: Damn. Should've stuck to my plan instead of getting greedy.
	capi3101: Well, this is a dumb idea, but...

33) capi3101: Sacrifice Y2 Capi3101
Move Y2 Capi3101 Babamots
Move Y2 Babamots Orion
Catastrophe Orion Y

34) Babamots: Build R2 Babamots
	capi3101: I wonder.
	capi3101: Ah. That's not going to work...the two systems are the same size.
	capi3101: Well, let's try this then. It'll probably cost me the game but...

	capi3101: At the very least, a disadvantage in large is forthcoming.

53) capi3101: A B3 Capi3101

	capi3101: Youre going to green me to death. Well played. 
	capi3101: Where did I lose this one?
	capi3101: Wait...
	Babamots: Oh shoot, we're out of blue, aren't we? Hmm. Looks like I should have been more patient.
	capi3101: Maybe not. I sense the game about to end but I dont see the how of it.
	Babamots: Doh! GG!
	Babamots: Perhaps we've both learned a few things this game ;-)
	capi3101: Indeed. Very good game; Ill gladly accept the rematch.
