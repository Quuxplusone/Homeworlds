Participants: goblin981 (S), dlwillson (N)
Winner: dlwillson

1) dlwillson: H B3 Y1 G3

2) goblin981: Homeworld G3 B2 Y3
	dlwillson: I have first turn. This is my favorite starting position. Now, you choose from banker, fortress, or goldilocks for a tiny universe.
	goblin981: what does each involve?
btw thanks for teaching me.
	dlwillson: The g3 is a staple. Blue is pretty desirable in nearly every strategy, leaving you to choose between red and yellow. Each has advantages and disadvantages. 

3) dlwillson: Build G1 Dlwillson
	dlwillson: Banker connects to 3's. Fortress to1's. Goldie to 2's. Try to find the Homeworlds strategy page. If you can't find it, let me know and I'll send you a link.
	dlwillson: That works, though usually, the g3 is taken as a ship. Want to take it back or forge ahead? You have a decent shot at a TwoShort, a yellow lockout, which is a flat game-winner, played right.
	dlwillson: It goes like this. G1 for me. Y1 for you. If I don't trade to y1, you build it, and I'm locked out of yellow ships. If I do trade, you get to build a y2.
	goblin981: I'll stick with this, (and possibly find out by it's not the best start)
I found the strategy page and am reading.
What's TwoShort and yellow lockout?
	dlwillson: Taking a Y3 is a fine choice. The thing you don't get, is the potential to do 3 builds in one turn by sacrificing the G3. It's not a big deal in every game, and not in most games against vets, because they watch for it.
	dlwillson: TwoShort is the top guy on the ladder right now.
I am taking some liberty by calling a yellow lockout a TwoShort, but not much. In many, many games, TwoShort goes straight for yellow denial. And if he gets it, he'll then tell you how many moves until he wins. That's how good he's gotten at playing that strategy.
	dlwillson: It's a pretty simple strategy, really. If you don't have enough yellow to reach me, it really doesn't matter what you do have. All I have to do is force-feed you the colors of your planets until they pop, and keep you from getting any yellow. It can be a long process.
	dlwillson: OK, the non-thinking round. We each build a small of our chosen ship type. I've never seen a time when turn 2 is anything else.

4) goblin981: Build Y1 Goblin981

5) dlwillson: Build G1 Dlwillson
	goblin981: I understand banker but why are fortress and goldilocks called that?
	dlwillson: And lots of thinking this round. You have a Y3, which makes me cautious. You can cross the universe in one turn. I can't. I can build three in one turn. You can't. What I'm planning right now, is how to beat you to larges, lock you out of a color, not get locked out of any colors, and advance on you, all at the same time.
	dlwillson: So, I'll build another green, because you don't have green, and I have enough yellow to spread my green out and setup for the triple build that will carry me to a second battleship before you get one.
	dlwillson: Also, it'd be nice to have red, but I'll let you lead on that. I'll have lots of spare ships after this. I just hope you don't go red when I DON'T have spares.

6) goblin981: Build Y1 Goblin981
	dlwillson: If you had a green, that would've been suicide, but your two away from a toss-able green. One move to trade to green. One move to make a third ship. By then, this opportunity to RPG (rocket-propelled green) will be over.
	goblin981: hmm, as I see it, I can lock you out of yellow or prevent you from locking me out of green.
What do you suggest?
 

	dlwillson: Oh, sorry, I meant to coach you on your turn, but I got busy...
 
You should absolutely go for yellow denial this turn. If we both get our locks, you win the game in the long term.
	goblin981: great, thanks. 

7) dlwillson: Discover G1 Dlwillson Y2 Slick
	dlwillson: So, now I'm spreading out my greens. Remember, my goal is to triple build. I'll go to a Y2, not intending to stay long.

8) goblin981: Discover Y1 Goblin981 G1 Green
	dlwillson: Fine for you, I stood up a Y2. If I keep it, your that much closer to your second battleship. If I don't, you look at your yellow denial strategy again.
	dlwillson: You must trade or split up your yellows. Trade Y3 to G3? Maybe. Send out a Y1, and keep building slow... Maybe. The G3 forces the split next turn. The split now, allows the trade next turn, or continued slow building. So, exploring seems better. But, what to discover?
	dlwillson: If you discover a G1, you can build more Y at it right away. OOPS! Part of my strategy is cramping your style there. Trading into sac'able G sometime in the future looks that much better.
	dlwillson: Discovering an R1 lets you capture an inbound small, but that's all, and the inbound ships won't always be small, and then the red planet becomes a liability.
	dlwillson: Discovering a Y1 would clear some stuph out of your way for your second battleship, but there are no Y1's left...  And, you should be starting to see why it's called "Fortress". The satellite system options get limited fast.
	dlwillson: Discovering a Blue gives you the ability to trade later. Your intent is to build lots of yellow ships, so there's a good chance you'll have two yellows at this first planet sometime soon, and having the option to trade one to another color (maybe green, maybe red) would be nice then. Since you're yellow, you'll also have the option to split when you get to two. Your next planet should probably be blue.
	dlwillson: After all that analysis, you need to make sure you're not giving me something by standing up a blue. Are you? No. I don't have any blue, and there're plenty of small blues in the bank, anyway. I don't have a gun, and if I move in on you, you can go for yours before I go for mine.
	dlwillson: Holy carp. We should print this, it's turning into a strategy guide...

9) dlwillson: Build G2 Slick
	dlwillson: Oops. Looks like I missed a G1 in my analysis. However, standing up the green, rather than a blue, definitely gives me something. I can build a g2 now, and it's a no-brainer to do so at the forward system.

10) goblin981: Build Y2 Green
	dlwillson: Lots to think about. I'll be back in a couple hours. Y2 looks good to you, no matter what, but what then, and keep watching for the guns to come out. (red ships)

11) dlwillson: D G2 Slick B1 Sticky

12) goblin981: Trade Y3 G3 Goblin981

13) dlwillson: S G3 Dlwillson
B G2 Sticky
B G2 Slick
B G3 Dlwillson
	dlwillson: I'm back on my phone. It's harder to type here. On my next turn I'll be making 3 greens. Your goal is to keep me from trading any of them for yellow.
	dlwillson: What if you trade Y3 for G3 this turn?

14) goblin981: Sacrifice G3 Goblin981
Build Y2 Goblin981
Build Y3 Goblin981
Build Y3 Green

15) dlwillson: Build G3 Sticky
	dlwillson: That was as planned. Now, you can free build a Y2, or sac the G3 to build a Y2 and two of the Y3's.
	dlwillson: Either one is safe from catastrophe for now. Both keep me out of Y, unless I trade my large. 
	dlwillson: Hmmm.... sac'ing the g gets you the first second large, but I'll build the g3 and have two, too.
	dlwillson: I think sac the g3 is the better plan. You should be able to keep yellow control, if I free-build it.
	dlwillson: When distributing your builds, if all other things are equal setup three different sizes in a system where you can trade, to maximize your options.
	dlwillson: Similarly, when you are trying to control access to a color, but you need to trade, look at what your opponent has available to trade, and offer him a size that he doesn't have, or won't want to give up.

16) goblin981: Trade Y1 R1 Goblin981

17) dlwillson: T G1 R1 Dlwillson
	dlwillson: I want to swap into that last Y3, but not in my homeworld, because I have a yellow star, and adding yellow to my homeworld would make it easier for you to cause a catastrophe there.
	dlwillson: You probably want to consider the fact that neither of us has red right now, so for Y2, Y1, G2, you could kill off one of my stars.
	dlwillson: Or, you can try to preserve your yellow near-monopoly.
Or, you can get a gun (red ship) and start pushing me around, if I don't get one, too.
	dlwillson: I have to think about your move. You don't have a monopoly on yellow, but you can beat me to the Y3, by discovering a Y3 star. But the Y3 star wouldn't do you any immediate good.
	dlwillson: You can kill my slick system the same way, too.
You have lots of possibilities, but nothing stands out as the best one. I'll think a bit and come back, unless you have a great idea.

18) goblin981: Move Y3 Green Slick
	dlwillson: I really want a yellow ship, but I can't ignore the gun rule.

19) dlwillson: T G3 Y3 Sticky
	goblin981: gun rule?

20) goblin981: Sacrifice R1 Goblin981
Attack G1 Slick
	goblin981: if I move a red ship into your system, such as sticky, can you attack me? or is the tech only mine?
	dlwillson: When the other guy goes for his gun (first red ship), go for yours, or get ready to get shot down.
	dlwillson: If you move your r1 to sticky, I can capture it, but only by sacrificing my r1 to get an attack anywhere.
	dlwillson: Your Y3 at slick is relatively safe, because even if I shoot my gun, it's too big for any of my slick ships to attack.

21) dlwillson: T G2 B2 Sticky
	dlwillson: I'm betting it was a bluff, and you're not really willing to give up your last red for my G2.
	dlwillson: Now that I've got big yellow, you have a threat to consider. If I sac the y3, I can put both greens in your home system at once.
	dlwillson: You can answer the threat by getting an r2 that you could sacrifice to capture both greens. Or, you can bet I'm not willing to give all that ship up to destroy one star.
	dlwillson: But wait! Even if you trade the y2 for an r2, I can still cat the star. Can you see how?
	dlwillson: So, after lots of thinking, I don't think you can save the green star. I think we'll look at making it expensive and creating a game-winning counter-attack.

22) goblin981: Trade Y2 R2 Goblin981

23) dlwillson: D G2 Slick Y1 Slippery
	goblin981: damn, should've taken the g2, I thought it was mine.
	dlwillson: Yes, and spending your last red to do it shows a surprising lack of foresight. Oh well. 

24) goblin981: Move R2 Goblin981 Slippery

25) dlwillson: M G2 Slippery Goblin981

26) goblin981: Build Y2 Goblin981

27) dlwillson: B G1 Goblin981

28) goblin981: Trade Y2 R2 Goblin981

29) dlwillson: B B1 Sticky

30) goblin981: Attack G2N Goblin981

31) dlwillson: M B1 Sticky Goblin981

32) goblin981: Move R2 Slippery Slick

33) dlwillson: S G3 Dlwillson
B G2 Goblin981
B B1 Goblin981
B B2 Goblin981
C Goblin981 G
C Goblin981 B

	dlwillson: That was definitely the fieriest ending I've ever seen! Wow!
	goblin981: lol damn, blew em both up.
good game, and thanks for the tips.
