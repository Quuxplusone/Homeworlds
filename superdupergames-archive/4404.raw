zoltar: Moving your Y3 which should be defending your homeworld to chase little ships is madness!
maka: The thing is, I keep thinking up plans that then I realize I cannot actually play, but I guess I've played too few games... :)

26) zoltar: Move Y2 Runforyourlife Maka

27) maka: Build R1 Maka
zoltar: Yes, it takes several games to get the feel of what's going on, but you're never going to get off the ground if you move your defending 3-pip ship out of your homeworld! Now look what trouble I can make for you...
zoltar: It's as if you marched your King out in the middle of the board the first three or four moves in chess.
maka: i see :)

zoltar: And now that I have three ships in your homeworld and you have no red ships, even your Y3 can't save you now...

32) zoltar: Sacrifice G3 Zoltar
Build R2 Maka
Build Y1 Maka
Build Y2 Maka
Catastrophe Maka Y
Catastrophe Maka R
zoltar: And I get to finish off with a bang -- a sacrifice with a double catastrophe for checkmate! Hopefully, you'll never let your defending big ship wander out of your castle again after this...

zoltar: GG. Play again?
