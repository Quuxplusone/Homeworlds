	randrews: Is the "extreme timeout" thing new? The game was actually over 500 days old, not 60...

	Aaron: It's not automated is the thing.  Before killing games I like to see for myself what is happening.  I just haven't had time to do all the DB maintenance stuff.  For this round of cleanup I looked for all games that had clocks more than 60 days in the red.
