68) mneme: Pass
	Draw5PlayAll: I offer to offer to offer to offer to offer to ... (x86) offer to offer a draw.

69) Draw5PlayAll: Pass
	mneme: Yeah, this is ugly.  Things might have been different had I killed your red two turns ago, but as it is I'm going to be hardpressed to take advantage of my R advantage, while you're going to find it pretty hard to reach my home system.
 
Partially so I can free up some mental space for starting my last sets of tournament games, accepted.

70) mneme: Pass
	mneme: pass is specifically for the purpose of offering back the draw; if you want to instead continue tell me and I'll undo it and move g2 to urania

	mneme: Good game.  I'm still curious as to how it would have gone had I blown up your R3 when I had a chance, but overall it was a delightful mess.
