	zoltar: Thanks.  I looked at the games among the top players and studied over a half dozen of them carefully to see if I could learn some of the tactical tricks, as I was getting swindled and blown up all over the place my first few games.  I've now got the basics down.  And I figured you (as well as my other opps) were out having fun for the 4th of July, as was I, so no problem.
