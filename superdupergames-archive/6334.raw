zoltar: Hi, TwoShort! Ok, I'll try this silly opening again which I still think is the best but which I can't seem to win with. :)

TwoShort: You know it's a good idea when the system makes you put in an asterix to prove you really want to do it :)

TwoShort: Dammit! I thought you wouldn't do that. Not sure why.

24) TwoShort: Build B3 Twoshort
zoltar: I figured it was a trap and I was about to die, but as I was lost if I didn't do it, my only choice besides resigning was to grab the rest of the yellow pieces, as now at least you are contained for a while.

25) zoltar: Build R1 Greenbelt

26) TwoShort: Build R1 Twoshort

27) zoltar: Build R2 Greenbelt

28) TwoShort: Move Y3 Twoshort Blueberry

zoltar: Yep, there's nothing I can do to stop you at this point. I analyzed the game, and figured that if you move your Y3 out, even if I blow up the star, then you trade a B3 immediately for a Y3 again, and I'm out that many yellow ships, etc. I now realize that the first person can never build a small blue star, given the opening response of yours. GG.
TwoShort: Um, OK... I would have said I narrowly snuck out of the total domination you had imposed on me, and that after you blew up the star and we broke each others monopolies, I'd be up by a couple ships, but nothing devastating. I certainly don't see how I could possibly have won in any kind of short term. Sorry, but it's really frustrating to have you resign at the first reversal; I've played games that have covered 4 or 5 lead-changes of this magnitude. This game was just about to get interesting.
zoltar: I didn't see that I had anything; also I was over at Andy Looney's, and showed him the position, and he said also that I was toast and didn't have a chance. You have the blue industry, you can get all the rest of the big ships, and now I can't stop you from getting Yellow ones either. I have nothing I can do at this point, as your yellow ship can march down and if I blow it up, you trade a blue ship for the Y3, and build your B3 again, and then you can always trade your B3's for R3's and rebuild your B3's whenever you want, and then just march them into my homeworld. I don't have anything I can do to attack you except to sit around and get the r1's while you get more of the 3-sized ships.
TwoShort: It seems to me after you blow it up and I trade a B3 to get my only yellow back, you can trade for the B3 at your homeworld or move from Greenbelt to the b2. I don't know, maybe you thought it through further than me, maybe I had you. But I didn't see it, and I'd have liked to. Personally, I never resign until I can see the exact, short series of moves that will finish me off. I don't know, I guess you've got to call them like you see them, but I think you'd be surprised ocasionally if you kept trying even when it seemed hopeless. If nothing else, you give me the chance to screw it up :)
