2) Draw5PlayAll: Homeworld B3 R2 G3
	Babamots: What's this about strange homeworld setups?
	Draw5PlayAll: I mean I don't want to play with small universes or instafreezes or anything like that.

13) Babamots: Trade R1 B1 Babamots
	Draw5PlayAll: Remember this undo when you inevitably coach me on my mistakes after I lose.

14) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall
	Babamots: My coaching is evitable, I promise. Normally, I only spew advice to new players who ask for it, and I wasn't planning to lecture you.
 
If you *would* like me to share my thoughts, just let me know. :-)

15) Babamots: Build B1 Babamots
	Draw5PlayAll: That's the reason I started this game. I always seem to come on the worse side of the opening economy, regardless of which seat I play.
 
But I'd prefer to wait until AFTER the game.

	Babamots: If you'd like, I'll write up my analysis so we can study the game together. I'll put it in chat when I've had chance to look back over the game.
	Draw5PlayAll: Sure.
	Babamots: Here are my thoughts on the turning points of the game. Let me know if you disagree or see anything you'd like to discuss deeper.
 
On move 6, you move your red ship away from home. I think you should have built an r2 instead for several reasons:
* Building r2 would keep you closer to even in material.
* Building r2 would give you two red ships at home. That would allow you to trade one of them without losing your only red ship. As it is, I get a 2-move head start in the blue economy.
* When I have a red ship alone in a green system, it usually stays there all game without achieving much. If ships from the "build" system are going to amount to anything, you'll need to spend time reinforcing with at least one other ship (which you do on turn 10). It's faster to discover with one of the other colors.
 
On move 10, you improve the health of "build," by moving in a b1. It looks like you realized on your next turn that you needed a medium ship there for defense. It would have been faster to move your b2 to "build" on move 10. Moving in the b2 on move 10 also would have kept your blue ships more spread out, possibly making it easier to build blue later.
 
On move 13, you opened up the large yellows. On move 14, I build all of the y3, but then you kill two of them with a catastrophe. I expected the catastrophe before I built and decided that it was worth it. Comparing the position after your 13th move to the position after your 14th move, I think the exchange went in my favor.
 
On move 16, I cash in on my blue advantage. At this point, I think the material is too much in my favor and the game is essentially over.
	Draw5PlayAll: OK.
 
On move 6, I think I was worried about opening up the R3s. You discover a new system with your red, I discover one with mine, and then you sac your G3 to build all the R3s. I guess I could trade away a red, but then with only one red ship I can never hope to mass-build in red anymore.
 
On move 10, the idea of sending the small first was so that if you built a B3 at Risa, I could destroy it only losing two small ships, whereas if I had sent the B2 out instead I would have had to lose it.
 
On move 11, I would have built a B2 at build, but that would have opened up the B3s.
 
On move 13, should I have mass-built yellow myself? The yellow stash appears to be 3332 at that moment.
	Babamots: You've got good counterpoints.
 
6
I agree that, if you build r2 as I suggested, there is a danger of me getting ahead by one or more r3. I think your next move should be to trade your r1 for b1. If I keep trying to get red, I think you would have time to build some yellow and get your r1 in a position to cause me a catastrophe if I get greedy enough to build an r3 at home. I may have to set this one up with pieces to work it out carefully and see who's right.
 
10
You're totally right. Your 10th move is good. Do you know what you had in mind on your 11th move? I think discovering another g1 system might have been better.
 
13
Yes, I think you would have been better off mass-building yellow yourself, two ships in your home and one in "build." I would almost certainly have built a y3 as well. I gained a large, you gained a large and a medium. After that, I think the position is pretty even.
	Draw5PlayAll: 10
I think I might have been trying to get a B3 myself on move 11, or else just diversifying.
 
Well, thanks for the tips.
