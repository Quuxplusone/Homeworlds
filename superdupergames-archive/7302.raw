Winner: clockwise

1) clockwise: Homeworld B2 R1 G3

2) jbj77: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3

3) clockwise: Build G1 Clockwise

4) jbj77: Build G1 Jbj77

5) clockwise: Trade G1 Y1 Clockwise

6) jbj77: Trade G1 Y1 Jbj77
jbj77: Oops, I really meant that to be a y3 instead of a y2, oh well. I never have bought the argument that you should always be distance 3 from your opponent's homeworld. In fact, I think I'm glad that I used a y2 instead of a y3.

7) clockwise: Build G1 Clockwise
clockwise: Ah, I was wondering about that. The last game I played someone did the same thing, though I don't know if it was intentional or not. Hopefully I can show you why it's a bad idea ;)

8) jbj77: Discover Y1 Jbj77 G3 Alpha

9) clockwise: Trade G1 R1 Clockwise
jbj77: In any case I should learn something here.
jbj77: I notice that you are doing quite well with Homeworlds: no losses so far.

clockwise: Out of curiosity... do you still feel that the proximity of our homeworlds is not to your disadvantage?

clockwise: Or do you feel the added pressure that it has enabled me to place you under? If so, do you feel that the advantage it gives in control over the large pieces is adequate compensation?
jbj77: Hmmm...I'll just say that I'm not yet convinced that it is to my disadvantage.

40) jbj77: Move Y1 Jbj77 Delta
jbj77: I do feel that my efforts are rather futile at this point. But, I don't blame it on the proximity of our homeworlds. I think that I would be toast without the ability to keep these large pieces out of your hands.
clockwise: You are definitely suffering more from my blue monopoly, but I feel that the reason that came about was back when I first assaulted the alpha system with my r1 forcing you to lose tempo retreating. With the extra tempo I was able to push both blue and red and you were only able to prevent one of the monopolies.

clockwise: Similarly I was able to use the proximity and tempo advantage in overtaking gamma. Which was mostly an even exchange from my perspective except that it also gave me additional development while taking away what was your only developed system. Plus even exchanges almost always favor the leader.
clockwise: So, yes, at the moment it is helping you a bit, but on the other hand it's also part of how we got to this situation to begin with.

41) clockwise: Move Y1 Clockwise Gamma
jbj77: Well yes, I suppose so. I can see how being closer amplifies the tempo advantage of the first player. So in that case, why doesn't the first player choose her/his homeworld markers to be of the same size? Then the other player can be at most distance 2.

42) jbj77: Build G2 Epsilon

43) clockwise: Sacrifice G3 Clockwise
Build Y1 Gamma
Build Y2 Gamma
Build Y3 Clockwise
clockwise: Good question. It's actually something I've been wondering about testing, but have not yet done so. I'm guessing that it starts out as an advantage, but if the game goes on too long you will start suffering from the fact that your opponent has more choices for staging attacks. So if it gives enough of an early advantage it may be worthwhile, otherwise it is probably a net disadvantage. One of these days I'll give it a try.

44) jbj77: Sacrifice G2 Epsilon

48) jbj77: Move R2 Jbj77 Alpha

49) clockwise: Build G2 Gamma
clockwise: Hmm, nice move
jbj77: Very much an act of desperation. I was about to resign when I thought of this.

50) jbj77: Trade G1 R1 Jbj77

51) clockwise: Sacrifice R1 Alpha
Attack R1S Jbj77
clockwise: The B2 move was more elegant, but sadly flawed. Claiming your yellow star was also tempting, but ultimately I'll just have to accept being a large ship up even though this position is less than ideal.
jbj77: I'm going to have to think about this one for a little bit.

Move B2 Alpha Jbj77
Catastrophe Jbj77 Blue
clockwise: Isn't blue pretty?
clockwise: The red build is a nice counter, I had been expecting you to move the y1 back. Of course my response would have been the same. I think you loose in 2 turns (3 if you do a failed kamakazi on my homeworld), but you've surprised me once already so perhaps you have another trick to pull out.

jbj77: Thanks for allowing me that. And thanks for the game. I guess you did teach me some things! :)
clockwise: Great game, thanks
