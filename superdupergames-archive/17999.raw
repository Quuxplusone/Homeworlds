	zoltar: Because you will die much faster if you don't have a red star. Note that I don't have to bring anything with me: when I made a 'gun' in my own homeworld last turn, the only way to avoid checkmate was to turn one of your two homeworld ships to red immediately. Since you didn't, it's checkmate now. Play again?
