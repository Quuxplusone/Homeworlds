35) Pat: Build R1 Pat
Aaron: I feel badly =/ Well, this is how we learn! Don't give up!
Pat: Don't feel bad! I actually prefer to play this way: against someone who knows what they're doing and larning from my mistakes. Don't hold back just because I'm new. .)

36) Aaron: Move Y1 Magrathea Bananas
Aaron: Well here's what you will want to do immediately. What I *could* do is move my R2 from Magrathea into your home system and that would end the game. You need to move one of your Red ships to a new Blue star system so you can get Green and Yellow back. I will still try to come after you, but you'll last a little longer that way.
