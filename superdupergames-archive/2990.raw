19) Jesse: Sacrifice G3 Jesse
Build Y3 Jesse
Build Y3 Makemonkeyfast
Build G2 Nomonkeydown
	Jesse: Don't be silly.  Of course monkey grows on trees!  Also, there's a pathetic 15 character limit, which I discovered when I tried "DoubleYourMonkey".  Very sad.

Move G1 Luella Nomonkeydown

	Laurie_Menke: ::sigh::  Alas.  :o/
	Laurie_Menke: BTW...where can I get me one of those trees?  I've been doing this all wrong!  ;o)

21) Jesse: Trade Y3 G3 Jesse
	Jesse: That's a tough one.  I think they're very hard to import, these days, on account of very strict quarantine requirements.  You might have more luck if you move to India.

	Jesse: This is why it's best not to wait too long to get into red after your opponent does.
	Laurie_Menke: Ack!  I forget about the darn sacrificing thing every time!  Grr....

27) Jesse: Build G1 Jesse

28) Laurie_Menke: Build G1 Laurie_menke
	Laurie_Menke: Actually, that last move was probably stupid, too.  I think my r3 star would have allowed my little 1's to attack your 2 if you came to my homeworld anyway, right?  ::sigh::

29) Jesse: Discover G1 Jesse Y3 Colorofmonkey
	Jesse: Yup.  You don't want to do any of the things you could do with that R3, either: You'll be blasted if you build a new red ship, and you'll leave your homeworld undefended if you move it out or sacrifice it (even if you had a target worth sacrificing it for).

30) Laurie_Menke: Discover G1 Laurie_menke Y1 Gettinoutadodge
	Laurie_Menke: Yep...I've screwed this up pretty royally.  :o(  But I'm going to do my best to try to salvage the situation....
