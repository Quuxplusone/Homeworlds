Winner: bhorner

1) bhorner: Homeworld R2 B1 G3
	bhorner: For the tournament right?
Good luck, and have fun!
 
I'm tempted to switch to your opening colors, it seems to have served you well, and I think everyone always wants to move before they want to attack.  I've just always relied on starting with the (big plus red at home) safety, instead of building it later when it's needed.
 
I don't think now is the time to tinker with strategy though, maybe I'll learn something from this game, and then tinker with it outside the tournament.  :)

	Trydnt: well played!
	bhorner: I'm glad you say so.  :)
I've wondered if there were better moves along the way.  I was completely focused on maintaining a material advantage until I could see an opening.  I hope I didn't detract with the slow moving, this was the hardest thinking game of homeworlds I've ever played!
 
Thanks very much for the game!
	Trydnt: Definitely, keep it up you're improving a lot. Obviously always good to keep eyes peeled for easy wins/exploits but yeah focusing on the material advantage is the best way. I should have just frozen you out of the blue right at the start by taking homeworld y2 b1 b3 but the blue freezout is never a fun game. Something to be aware of though, if you take a b1 in your homeworld it will usually cost you the game. Until next time :)
	Trydnt: homeworld g2 b1 b3
	bhorner: I actually wanted you to try to freeze me out of blue, but your homeworld selection is not what I expected.  I'll look into it!  :)
