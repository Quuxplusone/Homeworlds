Catastrophe Madwuher Blue
	MadWuher: Wow, after doing the Red Catastrophe, totally missed the blue catastrophe coming my way.  Nice Game.
	MadWuher: Was there any option for me to get out of that mess??
	TwoShort: Depends which mess you mean :)  Once I moved the 3s into your homeworld it was definitely over.  Before that, you were hurting pretty bad because my blue monopoly was getting me 3s that you weren't getting.  To get out of that you should have either broken the monopoly immediately by trading your 3 to blue on turn 2 or so, or agressively pushed for your own monopoly in another color, probably yellow.  Or, optimally, don't take a b1 star as first player :)
  In any case, thanks for the game!
