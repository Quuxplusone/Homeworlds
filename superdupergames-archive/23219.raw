	disaac: I had a couple of surprises from you in this game. Didn't realize it was a small universe until you moved out to dscwrld1. And didn't expect you to soak up the last large green by discovering it as a new system. 
	dungeon: Me either.  I was on the second move before it hit me.  Lol.  That green was supposed to be a haymaker... but came off as a three-stooges eye poke. ;-)
