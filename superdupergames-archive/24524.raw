33) mneme: Attack Y1 G3
	mneme: Thanks.  And yeah--small universe really magnifies small mistakes, I think.

34) wil: Build Y1 Wil
	wil: oh....that was foolish...i was moving it to a new star and didn't realize I walked into my old star...putting blunder on top or errors.

	wil: argghh...I hate it when these end this way...and especially against a good player.  I hope to meet you again sometime.
	mneme: Likewise.  The problem is, I'm only in one game at a time, tops, so if I miss the ready signal I'm likely to hard time.  :(
	wil: 
	wil: That can be solved by playing more often!  I hear you are a wonderful player.  But yeah, as I am in the learning curve I try to be in half a dozen games at a time...so I check in once a day (unless I am outta range for a few days)
	mneme: Wow -- from whom?  It, um, is true that when I was in form, I think TwoShort was the only player here who could regularly beat me (and I did take a game from him once :).  It's just a matter of time management, alas.
	wil: "The only people I never beat were mneme and two short" I believe was the quote.   Yes, I am afraid I don't give the game justice yet.  I move rather quickly make a lot of mistakes, but seeing the result of my mistakes and getting taken to the cleaners on a regular basis is assistingthe learning curve...
	wil: I see you are playing again...I've got a standing game up...challenge me if you'd like to whip me appropriately.
	mneme: That works.  I tend to play very quickly myself.  I've accepted a challenge, so if you're still playing it's possible I'll actually keep up this time.
	wil: Yup, continuing to try to learn this game!  Challenge me anytime, I prefer to keep half a dozen games going on at once..
