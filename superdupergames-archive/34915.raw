	Trydnt: it's important to note what color the small star is (R1 on your star in this case) as this will create a limiting factor in that color (only two of the smalls left in the bank). You pretty much have to trade for that one first as if you don't then your opponent will trade for it and if you fail to do it on the next turn (you should trade for red now) you'll be locked out of the red pieces and never get a chance to get them before I get to the bigger ones and start trading those for other big yellows and blues and stuff
	Trydnt: trading your b1 for an r1 is the only move that will stop me from getting into the big ones and likely winning but it puts you a move behind so it's always a good idea to trade for the color of the smallest piece first if you go first even if it's the color of your star
