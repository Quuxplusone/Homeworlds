Winner: Draw5PlayAll

1) Draw5PlayAll: Homeworld R1 B3 G3
	Draw5PlayAll: This is the political chatter game and NOT the team game.

2) mxpf: Homeworld G2 B3 Y3

3) MagicJohn: Homeworld Y1 B2 G3

4) Felix: Homeworld R2 G3 B3

5) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall

6) mxpf: Build Y1 Mxpf

7) MagicJohn: Build G1 Magicjohn
	mxpf: So...what does everything think about Larreta's plan to urbanize Villa 31? I'm all for it, myself.
	mxpf: *everyone DANG THESE CHUBBY FINGERS
	Draw5PlayAll: Felix is clearly the best player in the group. Be careful before he denies each of us of a different economy and then proceeds to build every legal R3 not used as a star.
	MagicJohn: build g1 magicjohn

8) MagicJohn: Trade G3 R3 Magicjohn
	Draw5PlayAll: I wonder if we should all target Felix though... After all, he can probably find ways of snagging all R3 ships and then implode our armies, dominating the battlefield.
 
I think we should not do this. After all, it is too risky for the rest of us. What if someone has to consistently make the big sacs and send in 2s and 3s while others send 1s and 2s? An anti-Felix conspiracy, or any other player for that matter, would cause some game-theoretical issues.
 
I have only one suggestion: Don't panic.
	Draw5PlayAll: Really though, if two people are going to cooperate to destroy a third, MAKE SURE that both people are giving up an equal amount. Otherwise the deal could flop: "Ha! Why don't you just lose those ships instead!" Or "Ha! I will not give up an R3 & Y3 for this!"
	MagicJohn: What I intended to initiate was a  Homeworlds game where players would form alliances and negotiate actions that could influence the outcome of games. Perhaps my languaging (political chatter) was misleading...... Sorry if it was. Real-life political discussion was not my intent. Given what is now happening in the presidential race, I'm not at all sure rational discussion or discourse is even possible. The Villa 31 situation is well discussed at http://www.bubblear.com/how-viable-is-the-villa-31-urbanization-plan-a-shantytown-delegate-weighs-in/. Sounds like another country is having to deal with the gaps between ideas, proposals, promises, and implementation of legislation...... with a tad of corruption tossed in on the side. Good luck with that...    
	Draw5PlayAll: Exactly the point of my last 2 posts

9) Draw5PlayAll: Trade G1 Y1 Draw5playall
	Felix: Oops. I didn't want that to happen! Sorry for timing out, everyone, but have fun!
	Draw5PlayAll: This game just got a LOT more interesting.
	Draw5PlayAll: When we sighted the sleeper ship, our planetary empire immediately passed laws that would support the education of highly intelligent members of our species, so that we could build the biggest ships faster and claim the sleeper.

10) mxpf: Build Y1 Mxpf
	MagicJohn: Note to battleship commanders: Please initiate beautification project and paint ships an eye-catching tone of red. 

11) MagicJohn: Build R1 Magicjohn
	Draw5PlayAll: We are not interested in "looking nice". Instead we wish to peacefully explore the Galaxy.
	MagicJohn: First impressions are important....
	Draw5PlayAll: We disagree, especially when large-scale and important galactic success vs failure is at stake.

12) Draw5PlayAll: Build Y1 Draw5playall
	mxpf: oh! Look at that! That sleeper is so close to our system! We must away to the stars, my people.
	Draw5PlayAll: So, how do you like the idea of each person throwing a B1 at the system and destroying the sleeper? After all, there is only a 1/3 chance you will get it.
	Draw5PlayAll: Plus the system is green so if someone bails, you just build another blue
	MagicJohn: We will consider your plan carefully..

13) mxpf: Discover Y1 Mxpf B1 Monad

14) MagicJohn: Trade R3 Y3 Magicjohn

15) Draw5PlayAll: Build Y2 Draw5playall
	mxpf: Indeed, I am considering the pants off of that plan.

16) MagicJohn: Build Y2 Magicjohn

17) Draw5PlayAll: Trade Y2 B2 Draw5playall
	Felix: Enjoy fighting over my corpse, folks!
	Draw5PlayAll: *ping*
	Draw5PlayAll: I have intercepted  message from one of the crew on mxpf' ships.
 
Life support systems are failing! We know you have the fix. Can you please assist?
 
Fascinating.

	Draw5PlayAll: The whole intent of your game was ruined though. Now we have no diplomacy or making deals. But we still have 5 of every piece. This will make for a crowded Galaxy.
	MagicJohn: What do you want to do??
	Draw5PlayAll: Your move

Move B2 Earth Mxpf

29) Draw5PlayAll: Trade B2 R2 Mxpf

	MagicJohn: Sorry, 15 year old pup just died and our "pack" is taking some time off....
	Draw5PlayAll: This game was boring. We should do another with 4/4/10 time control
	Draw5PlayAll: I knew it was just a matter of.... time... before something like this would happen.
I have a new challenge with a better time control and not using Hard Time.
