	dlwillson: Darn! That's the end!

	wil: I got lucky and capitslized.early on..
	wil: I guess i gotta get out there snd challenge now.
	dlwillson: I lost you when I went for the long stack of reds and you went for the short stack of blues. You got into the bigs before me and played perfectly. I thought I had enough material at the end to hold you off, but I was mistaken. A horseshoe nail more, and I could've stopped that attack!
	wil: Yeah, the bank accountant gave me a stock tip and said the brokers were at a discount.
	wil: Nobody can blame you for investing in defense, historically it has been known to payoff...but alas we were in a time of peace...
