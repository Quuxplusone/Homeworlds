Attack G3 Felix
Attack B3 Felix

	Draw5PlayAll: I noticed how my homeworld looked and wondered... have there been any games where both sides were reduced to only green and red and could not do anything of value?
	Felix: The opportunity didn't present itself until after you moved your R3 out. Had I built the b1 in your homeworld, I needn't have sacked my y2, so I could have used it to move my G3 directly to your home. You could have done nothing to stop me from building another green and finishing off your homeworld.
	Draw5PlayAll: Oh, in that case I simply would not have moved the R3.
	Felix: If you had seen the danger :)
	Draw5PlayAll: Well, I was nervous about moving the R3 anyway, and even feared you could do something to win, but then I realized you could not. Especially considering that G2 in there...
	Draw5PlayAll: I think that was the first time I ever won against you.
	Felix: Yes, well done! You've improved quite a bit. Looking forward to a rematch.
