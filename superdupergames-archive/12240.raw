7) stoneaxe: Build G1 Stoneaxe

8) MrMoto: Build B1 Mrmoto
	stoneaxe: Trollkin, welcome to the game!  Make sure you don't build 4 of the same color in your homeworld, or someone will 'Catastrophe' you!    I did it in one of my first games.  Haha!  The 2 player version of this game is easier to "strategize" about.  4 player is just too many variables for me to think about, so I will just take it one move at a time.  This is only my 2nd game of 4-player.  My very first Homeworlds game was also 4-player, and its harder to learn the strategies this way.  But you are off to a good start!
 
Some may disagree, but I think Homeworlds is similar to Chess; or it exercises similar parts of the brain, or something.   Alien City is cool like that too.
	stoneaxe: Just curious:  What do you 3 have as far as real-life Icehouse pieces (stashes)?  I only have some homemade ones made out of card-stock.  I've played Martian Chess with them and a crude game of Homeworlds, but they worked.  Maybe I'll place an order for some 'real' plastic ones around Christmas.    Any Recommendations?
	MadWuher: I have 5 sets of the Rainbow colour treehouse sets giving me a total of 5 full stashes (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow and Black). I also bought the Grey stash from Looneylabs (so I can play Volcano) and am thinking of getting the Pink stash (just so I can play Volcano with all opaque colours). I want to create some card stock pyramids so I can keep them in my office in case I have a tricky move to make (in Homeworlds of course) and then I can keep my plastics ones safe and sound at home.

	MrMoto: Trollkin, you might want to avoid building so many Green ships in one spot. Remember that if a system has four pieces of one colour, including stars, then they can be wiped out in a catastrophe -- and Decapod10 isn't far away ...

	MadWuher: Just to warn both Trollkin and Stoneaxe, I have the ability to reach either of your homeworlds with a green ship and cause a catastrophe. I see Mr. Moto traded a green away so he is safe (for the moment). I would suggest fixing this ASAP as next turn, I may not feel so generous as to leave the two of you alone. <insert evil laugh here>

	stoneaxe: If you think real-life outer space is bad, check out.... uhm... oh wait.  nevermind.

	stoneaxe: Observation:  It kind of makes it tough because the System's squares keep moving around anytime something changes.  It would be nicer if once a System was in one spot, it stayed there.  Its like you have to "re-learn" all the locations of Systems every time turn.  I doubt if I have the energy to start hacking away at the code though.  
Doesn't seem like it would do this if we played over a real board.  Do you think the enhancement would justify a Forum posting though? That could help in 2P games too.
	MrMoto: I agree very much, it's very disorienting. I think it definitely justifies a forum post.

	stoneaxe: Well, Great game to all of you!  It was fun!  There was a critical moment in the game where if I went after wuher, then moto would wipe me out, and if I went after moto, then wuher would wipe me out.  I wavered, and ended up attacking moto, which cost me some extra moves.  He seemed the more immediate threat, but by the time I got into position, you had built up.   I must learn more patience............ :)   And now the unstoppable MadWuher empire will rule the galaxy!
	MrMoto: Thanks for the game! I think I was too impatient as well, going for the attack instead of waiting for the other two players to weaken themselves ...
 
It was fun though!
	MadWuher: Thank you all for the game. These multiplayer games are a lot of fun. Trying to keep everything clear though is difficult.
