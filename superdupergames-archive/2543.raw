	jeep: I keep getting myself behind in the early game.  I guess I need to pay more attention.  *sigh*
	Jesse: It's not easy.  The opening at first seems simple because there aren't as many options as later, but it's surprisingly subtle.

13) Jesse: Build B2 Plus
	Jesse: It is almost always a bad idea to leave your homeworld without a large ship to defend it.  If you think you can get away with it, more power to you, but I think it's quite dangerous here.

41) Jesse: Sacrifice R3 Jesse
Attack G3 Jeep
Attack G1 Jeep
Attack R2 Plus
	Jesse: In some situations, two one-pointers are better than one two-pointer.  Unfortunately for you right now, defending against mass invasions is not one of them.  Remember this kind of attack for the future; it is often more effective than trying to destroy the opponent's ships of stars, which can require huge sacrifices.

	jeep: I've won with this type of attack before.  But I thought I was safe- for now.  I know I was way behind for most of the game, though.  Thanks for the game!
