50) Aristos: Attack R1 Flare
	Aristos: I see a glimmer of hope in my greater maneuverability. You have no yellow to use to run away or to press your attack quickly. Going to be tough, but *maybe* I can pull something together. 
	Aristos: By the way, I tend to use the "move, undo, move" sequence a lot in the end game. I don't have physical pieces to move around, and frequently I use it to visualize alternative boards. I undo pretty quick (just grab a screenshot) so you won't be stuck thinking there's a move for you. If I move and I'm not going to undo, I'll leave you a message. 
	bhorner: Ok, well...  my time starts running when you've moved, so I may not wait for a message to make my move, but I won't be trying to pounce on you in between experiments or anything.  How about if I see that you moved at least a half hour ago, I'll feel free to move?  Also, I didn't know that you could continue undo-ing, I thought I could only do it once, and then after I remade the move, undo was no longer available, interesting that you can do it repeatedly.

51) bhorner: Build B1 Bhorner

52) Aristos: Move R1 Flare Art
	bhorner: Yeah, I just tried it, it appears that I can't undo again.
	Aristos: Only one undo per move, and if I undo, it rolls back your time. That's why I do it fast -- move, grab screenshot, undo. :-)
