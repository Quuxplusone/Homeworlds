23) Felix: Trade G1 B1 Opus
	orangeblood: I read somewhere that's what you're supposed to do, so I did... haha. Now, this latest red build is more a lack of knowing what else to do.

24) orangeblood: T R1 B1 Bevo
	Felix: It's a good rule of thumb to follow! You may want to try to diversify into blue soon.

25) Felix: Sacrifice G3 Felix
Build G1 Opus
Build G3 Felix
Build R1 Felix
	orangeblood: The problem with blue is the rule of thumb about taking the last piece of a size. Of course, if everyone followed those rules no one would be building. 
	Felix: That's true. There's pros and cons to every action, and sometimes you have to violate a rule of thumb just to get a certain color. If you get locked out of the color, you will be in trouble. But in this case, it wasn't a bad move, because I can't build a blue at the moment anyway, or I would have three blues in the opus system and you could easily cause a catastrophe there.
