	Babamots: I've been enjoying your game! Instead of continuing to lurk, I thought I'd test whether observers really get to post comments.
	ts52: Glad you're enjoying it. And yes, lurkers can comment!

56) ts52: Trade G2 B2 Grover
	Draw5PlayAll: Very intense.. I like these ones where half the homeworld dies, yet said player has control.
 
[Removed due to Prime Directive]
	Babamots: What does "Removed due to Prime Directive" mean? Was a comment censored somehow or is that what Draw5 actually typed? Maybe redaction due to interfering with the natural development of a "culture" (i.e. game)?
	ts52: I'm pretty sure that's just Draw5PlayAll's sense of humor coming through. :)

57) Pheonixian: Move B1 Eden Lemon
	Pheonixian: Indeed, I'm pretty sure of that. It is amusing. 
The game itself has been very interesting, thank you much for it, ts52. 

58) ts52: Move B2 Grover Bigbird
	ts52: Agreed, this had been a very interesting game.
