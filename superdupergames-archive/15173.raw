	rootbier: hey. first timer here.
i have played the game face-to-face.
we'll see how it goes with coding my moves :)

3) rootbier: Build G1 Rootbier
	jonaskoelker: Hi, rootbier.  Good luck, have fun.
 
I've played a few games; I'm not that great, but I seem to have a firmer grasp of the game than the friends I play face-to-face.
 
I found the move encoding to be reasonably straightforward.  Once you grasp the homeworld command, the rest should be fairly easy.  You may also want to see Andy's game vs. Russell at http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Andy/Games/HomeworldsPBEM/Game1Report1.html --- the notation is different, but it may help.
 
May the best intergalactic space fleet commander win! :)

	jonaskoelker: Captain's log, stardate 20100120: Our terraformers have just flown into the gravity well of a double system.  We have named the system after ourselves, jonaskoelker.  Headquarters informs us that settlers from an alien civilization may be occupying systems nearby in the galaxy.  We will proceed to make first contact immediately, in order to study these alcohol-based life forms.

	rootbier: *BURP* You she'here pal ... isch not really my fault. Isch jusch the una*URP*foidable an' unfor*URP*chunate composischun of my blood.

4) jonaskoelker: Build G1 Jonaskoelker

5) rootbier: Trade G1 B1 Rootbier
	jonaskoelker: Captain's Log, stardate 20100121: We have just received our first communication from the strange alcohol-based life forms.  It appears their are peaceful and even submissive towards us, yet they multiply at an alarming rate.  I have ordered the construction of more ships.  We may need them for our safety.


6) jonaskoelker: Trade G1 B1 Jonaskoelker

7) rootbier: Sacrifice G3 Rootbier
Build B2 Rootbier
Build B2 Rootbier
Build B3 Rootbier
	jonaskoelker: Captain's Log, stardate 20100127: We have reequipped one of our terraformer ships with trading technology, in anticipation of trade with our neighbours.

8) jonaskoelker: Build B3 Jonaskoelker
Catastrophe Rootbier Blue
	rootbier: Am I seein' dubble *HIC* or whud? Seems like I dun' gonen' shploded myschelf up innta big li'l bits *HIC*
	jonaskoelker: Captain's Log, stardate 20100128: Our radio astronomers have reported an unexpected supernova from the nearby stars, where the alien civilization lives.
 
Or rather used to live.  The radiation from the nearby blue giant's sudden explosion must have killed them.
 
There is nothing more to explore in this galaxy.  On to new adventures.

	jonaskoelker: Lesson: Keep the catastrophes in mind.  They limit the use of G3 in the early game.
 
Don't blame the G3's, though---they're good mid-game threats, when you have a few systems and some different colours.
 
Thanks for playing.  I'm up for another game if you are :)

	rootbier: yeah -- somehow it is too abstract for me in iconic pixel form -- i have never done such a move when i have the pyramids in front of me -- so yes -- let's do that again
