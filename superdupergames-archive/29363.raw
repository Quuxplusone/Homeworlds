	Felix: Starting with a yellow ship is slightly harder. Having a large green at the beginning gives you a lot more potential build power later if you sacrifice it. Having a large yellow has its advantages too, though, so it all comes down to how you like to play.
	Felix: Starting with a red, as I did, is pretty dangerous. But it can also have its advantages if used properly. It just makes things more difficult for me in the beginning game, because I have to trade for yellow before I can move anywhere.

14) Felix: Discover B1 Felix G2 Out
	Felix: It is dangerous to let your opponent get all of the smalls of a particular color before you yourself have any mediums, especially blue. In this case, I have all the small blues, and you can't trade for blue unless you first build a medium, or trade away your large yellow, which isn't ideal.  In general, you don't want to let the opponent get a monopoly on any one color, but blue is especially dangerous since I can easily trade blues for other ships. If there is only one small of any color left, ad you don't have it yet, it's usually a good idea to try to get it.

	ugoggino: Don't know what I can do... It's getting complex

22) Felix: Trade B1 R1 Felix
	Felix: Getting a blue was smart, since I have so much in my home system, and you also don't want me to monopolize it. You want to try to cause a catastrophe in my home system if possible, but you also want some sort of plan to finish the job after you blow up half my homeworld. If you don't, you may leave yourself open to a counterattack. It does get pretty complex, but a few games will help you wrap your head around it!

43) ugoggino: Pass
	Felix: By stripping away your large yellow ship with a catastrophe and moving my own large ship in at the same time, I have disabled your defenses, while having my own large red waiting to be sacrificed essentially guarantees I can capture any defenses you try to move in. I know it was tempting to capture my green ship in the gate system, but in this case, that was just a distraction, and I didn't need that ship anymore to put my plan into motion.
	Felix: It's definitely difficult to recognize maneuvers like this, and even harder to defend against them, but you have actually played very well in this game! You've got a great sense for the game, and I think you will get very good at it with practice.
	ugoggino: good game, thanks
