	TwoShort: I think I had you back when I gained the upper hand on 3 pointers, but you've held me off for an impressively long time.  Now, however, I'm afraid the end is nigh...

	sketchwick: glad I was impressive in SOME way, I'm very inexperienced...I hadn't thought of the power of moving in two big ships when you have at least an r2

	TwoShort: Well, I hope you'll keep playing; you're obviously good at thinking through the posibilities a couple moves in advance; just need to work on your early game.
	TwoShort: A couple tips:  1) Red is the least useful color.  Optimally, I never take red except for a single two point ship the turn after my opponent takes red, or the turn before I'm threatening to use it.  2) The early game is about getting 3 pointers.  A significant disadvantage in 3 pointer count is usually insurmountable.
