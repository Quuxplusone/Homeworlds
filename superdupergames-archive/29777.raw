Homeworlds Online (SDG# 29777)
Variants: "Unrated, Sinister"
Started: 2016.5.19, Ended: 2016.6.13
Participants: Draw5PlayAll (S), Steele (N), Felix (E)
Winner: Steele

1) Steele: H B3 R1 G3

2) Felix: Homeworld G3 Y2 B3
	Felix: So how does sinister work again? You have to try to destroy the player on your left?

3) Draw5PlayAll: Homeworld B1 R2 G3 Invincible
	Felix: Have fun everyone :)
	Draw5PlayAll: Oh! My request was accepted and I get banker!
Felix, THAT is a weird home world.
 
So I take it that:
I must destroy Steele
Steele must destroy Felix
Felix must destroy me
 
And we get 4 of each piece, how nice is that.

4) Steele: B G1 Steele

5) Felix: B B1 Felix

6) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: I suppose I should get my green going before I get frozen out of blue Â— knowing Felix, he'll probably do just that.

7) Steele: T G1 Y1 Steele

8) Felix: Discover B1 Felix G1 Colony
	Felix: Haha I'll do my best!

9) Draw5PlayAll: Trade G1 Y1 Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: I want to do a GB home world with an R3 ship, as that gets me in the weapons economy from move one. Too bad I already picked for this game

10) Steele: B Y1 Steele

11) Felix: Build B1 Colony
	Felix: That's doable, but difficult. It's generally less useful to have weapons in the early game, and it can also cause problems to have green in your homeworld. It makes it more difficult to set up the "factory" in your homeworld. I chose green in my homeworld in this game to give myself a slight handicap since I have more experience than you two.

12) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall

13) Steele: D Y1 Steele G2 Alpha
	Draw5PlayAll: So is the home-world that I have (ignoring the two Constellation ships) the optimal one? Or is it better to have yellow in your world so you can move from the start?

14) Felix: Trade B1 Y1 Colony
	Felix: From my experience, the optimal starting homeworld is a small blue and medium yellow star, and a large green ship. It all comes down to preference though!

15) Draw5PlayAll: Build Y2 Draw5playall

16) Steele: B Y2 Alpha

17) Felix: Build B1 Colony

18) Draw5PlayAll: Trade Y1 R1 Draw5playall

19) Steele: Build Y1 Steele

20) Felix: Trade B1 R1 Colony

21) Draw5PlayAll: Trade G1 B1 Draw5playall

22) Steele: T Y1 R1 Steele

23) Felix: Build R2 Colony
	Draw5PlayAll: No more blue freezing, Felix!

24) Draw5PlayAll: Discover R1 Draw5playall G3 Bigwood
	Felix: That would be a lot harder to do with this many pieces in the pool!

25) Steele: Discover Y1 Alpha G1 Beta

26) Felix: Discover R2 Colony Y2 Ridgeline
	Draw5PlayAll: Sorry for stealing the planet name!

27) Draw5PlayAll: Build R2 Bigwood

28) Steele: S G3 Steele
B Y1 Alpha

B Y3 Beta
Pass

29) Felix: Build Y3 Colony

30) Draw5PlayAll: Build Y3 Draw5playall

31) Steele: Trade Y1 B1 Steele
	Draw5PlayAll: Eek! The resources for creating movement ships are near nonexistent. We are forced to take the last share of that economy before it's too late and we freeze out of it.

32) Felix: Build B2 Felix

33) Draw5PlayAll: Move B1 Draw5playall Bigwood
	Felix: This got really hectic, really fast o.o

34) Steele: M R1 Steele Alpha
	Draw5PlayAll: Our colony on Big Wood is in slight danger of catastrophe and so we are sending a Constellation-class trading vessel over to the planet.

35) Felix: Move Y3 Colony Bigwood
	Draw5PlayAll: I did notice that all of us have *exactly* two large ships.

36) Draw5PlayAll: Sacrifice B1 Bigwood
Trade Y3 R3 Draw5playall

37) Steele: M B1 Steele Alpha

38) Felix: Sacrifice R2 Ridgeline
Attack R2S Bigwood
Attack R1S Bigwood

39) Draw5PlayAll: Discover R3 Draw5playall G3 Inflation
	Draw5PlayAll: We couldn't let you have access to our precious ships in the BigWood system. And plus, we needed a Galaxy-class ship that had phasers. We decided to use our long-range action system to suicide the small blue.

40) Steele: M B1 Alpha Beta

41) Felix: Move Y3 Bigwood Alpha
	Felix: We are a warlike race, so I'm afraid it is in our nature to capture as many enemy ships as possible. It is just the way we are... please don't hold it against us! 

42) Draw5PlayAll: Build Y1 Draw5playall

43) Steele: Build B1 Beta

44) Felix: Sacrifice B1 Colony
Trade Y3 B3 Alpha
	Draw5PlayAll: I was going to inflate my red economy, but I realized you could diplomatically send in small reds, one each, and explode my large and medium. Instead I'm interested in propulsion technology.

45) Draw5PlayAll: Sacrifice G3 Draw5playall
Build Y2 Draw5playall
Build Y3 Draw5playall
Build Y3 Draw5playall
Catastrophe Draw5playall Yellow

46) Steele: Sacrifice Y2 Alpha
Move B1 Beta Felix
Move B1 Beta Felix
Catastrophe Felix B

	Draw5PlayAll: Interestingly enough, my guy at Inflation did NOT disintegrate.
	Felix: Oh wow - definitely did not see that. Should have been more careful. It gets hectic with 3 players. Was fun though! Let's do it again some time. And well done Steele!
	Steele: You have taught me well :)
