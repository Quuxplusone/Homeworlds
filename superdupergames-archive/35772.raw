Participants: Cuc (S), Babamots (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) Babamots: Homeworld R2 B2 G3 *

2) Cuc: H G3 Y1 R3 *
	Babamots: I've been wanting to try a single-size homeworld. I think it will shorten the Hanne, which ought to work in favor of the player with first move advantage. Let's find out. :-)

3) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots
	Cuc: I take It on! I got a warning I should have blue. I realize it'll take some effort to access it, but I could travel to your HW . . . :-)
	Babamots: Bring it!

4) Cuc: Build R1 Cuc

5) Babamots: Trade G1 Y1 Babamots
	Cuc: I played a game last Thursday, where the HW of me and my opponent were connected. I thought it would be a quick game, but it took 40+ moves. That was kind of a surprise. It took a time to establish a positional advantage, before it could be used to construct a winning situation. We'll see what happens here . . .

	Cuc: It's like watching magic: great skill!

21) Babamots: Move R2 Babamots Risa
	Babamots: Once you've got a big enough lead in one color, you can really run away with it. Yellow is my favorite for this.
	Cuc: You robbed me of the opportunity to get Yellow at all! I wonder how you did that. I don't think I can follow the steps yet.

	Cuc: I haven't been able to acquire any yellow yet. I can not move anything back to my HW. I'm kinda stuck and waiting for the yellow invasion ;-B

28) Cuc: Pass
	Babamots: Yellow is definitely the worst color to get locked out of. Green is also bad if it's early game.

29) Babamots: Sacrifice Y3 Babamots
Move R2 Risa Bolarus
Move R3 Bolarus Cuc
Move R2 Bolarus Cuc
Catastrophe Cuc R
	Cuc: Is there a decision tree you follow to lock somebody out? It seems systematic that you've been able to accomplish this. I'm not sure I understand how you made that happen. Or, by the same token, what I did to allow you . . .

	Cuc: We haven't seen the advantage, I believe. Perhaps that shows that we're just beginners? But in that event, we play 2 games to even out the "advantage". My buddy said that we both have the same "disadvantage", meaning that we did not get to choose our HW and have to make it work. It's fun to explore the strenghts/weaknesses of each of the possible HWs. I'm trying to gain enough experience to oversee the tactical impact of each possible HW (combo of stars, size/color) 
	Babamots: GG. I think it's wise to get a yellow ship early so you're always ready to build more.
	Cuc: Thx, I enjoy a game like this, even if I am at the losing hand. I see things and gradually learn.
	Babamots: If you want to look back and identify definite mistakes, maybe you can learn some general principles to improve the next game. Let me know if you want any help :-)
