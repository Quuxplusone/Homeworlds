	Aristos: The Gods said unto Aristos, "Build an ark large enough to hold all the people and animals of the world, but small enough to sail in the sky." And Aristos, leader of his people said, "How about we compromise at a Y3?" And the Gods said, "Good enough." And so it was that the Aristos Nation lifted itself above all others and so imposed its will upon the land that the world itself became known as Aristos thereafter.

	Aristos: "Strange tidings, Councilors," said the head of the Aristos SETI Project. "We have detected artificial signals within interstellar e-waves. We have no idea what they mean, but they are clearly artificial."
"Let us sail upon the black to other stars and see if we can find the source! What is the nearest star to us?"
"We call it 'Glint,'"
"Then that shall be our destination."
