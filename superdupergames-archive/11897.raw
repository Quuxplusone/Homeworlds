	Jesse: You have a serious problem developing in your lack of yellow ships.  You will quickly find yourself frozen out and unable to move your ships where you want them.  To avoid this in the future, you'll want to make sure you get into any given color before your opponent can run away with all the smaller pieces.  One good idea for retaining the flexibility to do that is when you're sending small green ships out from your homeworld, discover blue systems.  Then you can quickly build more green ships and trade them for yellow (or whatever color you need).  Red single stars are particularly limiting.
	MrMoto: Hm, you are right. I don't have many yellow ships. Thank you for the advice; I am new to this game.

20) Jesse: Discover G2 Jesse B3 Nibbly

21) MrMoto: Build G3 Dandelion
	Jesse: It's my pleasure to help new players.  The problem you have now is that you can't effectively use your Y3 to build new yellow ships, because you also have a yellow system marker.  If you build another yellow, that puts you at three yellow pieces, on the brink of a catastrophe.  That situation can be alright as long as I don't have any yellow ships within movement range, but I can now sacrifice a Y2 to move a piece two steps from Bitey to your home system.
	MrMoto: Ah, right -- thanks for pointing that out. I see that it was important not to build a green ship in my homeworld this turn for the same reason.

22) Jesse: Sacrifice G3 Jesse
Build G3 Jesse
Build Y3 Chompy
Build Y3 Jesse
	Jesse: Yes, exactly.  It's usually best to defend the home world with ships of colors different from either of your system markers.  Even if you don't plan to use them for production, it's relatively easy for your opponent to two ships into range to sacrifice to get them both into your system in one turn.
 
Although your last couple of moves don't do as much as you would like for keeping you in the yellow economy, they do help.  And, by the way, they are also a good example of using the weakness of my green concentration against me.  Because I could not build another green, trading your large green for another color and rebuilding it on the following turn was an inexpensive way for you to get another large ship.  But that's okay with me, because now I get to exploit my yellow advantage...

23) MrMoto: Build B1 Mrmoto

24) Jesse: Trade Y2 R2 Chompy
	Jesse: In case you don't know it, this maneuver of sacrificing a G3 for two free builds is a common tactic called the factory.  Another thing to note: Although having three of the same color in your system is generally bad, I wanted another large ship there, and I feel safe because you cannot immediately reach me and I have several possible development plans to correct the issue well before you could get there.
	Jesse: You *could* have done the same thing to build two small blues, here.  You may undo and try that, if you like.  I'll leave it to your judgement whether building one or two at this moment is better.

25) MrMoto: Discover Y3 Mrmoto B2 Potato
	MrMoto: Thanks for the advice, and sorry for the wait. I have learned the strategy of trading in G3s, but maybe I ruled it out because there were no greens left in stash, and I forgot I could get my G3 back. I'll know for next time.

26) Jesse: Sacrifice Y2 Jesse
Move Y3 Chompy Potato
Move Y3 Potato Mrmoto
	Jesse: Yes, the fact that sacrificed ships and abandoned systems go directly to the stash can be quite important.

	Jesse: There are two strategic rules of thumb that this situation should show the importance of.  One is, never leave your homeworld undefended.  That almost always means having a large ship there, because mediums and smalls cannot capture large ships on their own.  The other is, when your opponent picks up a gun, you should pick up a gun.  Guns, in this context, are red ships.  Red system markers can allow captures only in that system.  Red ships can be sacrificed to provide captures anywhere.  Sometimes one of these can be violated temporarily to gain an advantage, but that's usually quite early on.
	Jesse: Thanks for the game.  I hope it's been helpful.
	MrMoto: Argh! Thank you, you have been very helpful indeed.
