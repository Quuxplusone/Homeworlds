Catastrophe Pib Y
	Pib: SDG totally allows you to trigger the catastrophe that kills you.
	Draw5PlayAll: Actually, I think even the official rules allow you to abandon your homeworld mid-turn as long as you get back there before your turn ends.
	Babamots: Even the most recent rules for Pyramid Quartet could be a little more clear about this, but they do allow suicide.
 
There's this older version of John's rules that definitely don't allow it:

SDG is old enough that it might have implemented the old rules, at least in some circumstances, so I wanted to check. :-)
