Participants: wil (S), AcetyleneLamp (N)
Winner: wil

1) AcetyleneLamp: Homeworld B1 G2 Y3
	AcetyleneLamp: Where are the system lablels? I clicked hide/show system labels a couple of times and there still aren't any labels.
	AcetyleneLamp: What kind of first move should I make?
	AcetyleneLamp: Have you played this before? I don't understand how to do anything.

2) wil: Homeworld B3 Y2 G3
	AcetyleneLamp: I found the games in progress on this site and looked at the commands for archived games. I still don't quite understand what I'm doing though.
	AcetyleneLamp: I'm trying to learn how to play some Looney Pyramid games on this site so I can introduce them to people I know in an offline gaming group. They might not go for this one (I think Zendo is out of the question), but they might like some of the simpler games like Blam.
	wil: You've chosen a fine start...banker star system...the yellow big ship is questionable...it works but is better suited for an experienced star ship captain...easier with a green (to maintain factory) I'll show you why... (don't know about system labels, never clicked that before)
	wil: anyone who likes chess will love this when they grock how incredible it is.

3) AcetyleneLamp: Build Y1 Acetylenelamp
	AcetyleneLamp: Ok, what kinds of things can I do now? I tried to build a new ship in my home system but it's telling me I need to already have one of the same color? How do I get that?
	wil: You have a G in your homeworld star so you can always build (I have a G ship, so while my homeworld stars don't have that ability I do)  So you only have a mockup for a yellow ship, you can only build what you already have...so you can build yellow.
 
After you've built (first real move is a small ship the same color as the large ship..we are discussing as to whether that is will be the real start (there are times when a response may not be)..anywho... then you can trade (since you have blue in your star) either of those ships to a different color and then have the ability to build it as well)  G build/grow...Y move/fuel  B  trade/change  R attack
 
one other biggie...over population, 4 of any one color in a star system (including the star) can cause a catastrophe and all the pieces of that color go back to the bank (if the star blows too, then all the ships anchored in that system are destroyed as well.   We call this a reboot...

4) wil: Build G1 Wil
	AcetyleneLamp: Sorry if it seems like I'm relying on you to teach me these games, the rules for some of them don't really make sense to me until I've had a chance to play a game or two, and the somewhat clunky interface on this site doesn't help.
	AcetyleneLamp: Why doesn't think game have a list of legal rules you can bring up like the others?
	AcetyleneLamp: Legal moves, I mean.
	wil: this site is basically been running wild for awhile..aint the best and all we got... to much work coding legal moves on this one....but there is some behind the scenes (different curtain) shenanigans going on
	wil: like any game there is a learning curve...some slow some fast...learning curve for something as simple as go...  this is not as long as chess..four or five games and you'll have about all the tricks figured...then it is seeing them

	wil: If you wish, I'll inform you reason of and ask you to back off of a noticeably bad move.. and try again... I'll also tell you of situations I established and why...
	wil: you can only move to stars of a different star than the one your ship is currently in...so you can only move to 3s and I can only move to 1s right now.  
	wil: When you discover a new system...you name it..whatever you'd like..for future reference (in live games they don't get a name)
	AcetyleneLamp: I'm trying to discover a new system but it says there are insufficient pieces in the stash.
	wil: what is listed as the global reserve stash is the bank...you can't discover a star that doesn't have it in the bank...
