	Aaron: Howdy...what seems to be the problem?
	Kermit: well I was trying to do the following... sac g2 nymex ~ b g2 amex ~ b g3 amex ~ Cat amex green but i get the error that I cannot build in amex. I should be able to after I sacrifice. (or so i thought.
	Kermit: I would still like to do that even though I should have done it in his home system (hint/warning to Uglyfoot)
	Kermit: I just realized the bit about his home system but will stick with my original intended move since if it had executed i wouldn't be able to take it back now.
	Aaron: I'm afraid you are misunderstanding how green sacrifices work.  You don't own any ships in Amex, therefore you can't build there, no matter the sacrifice.  The sacrifice simply lets you build in other sectors, but only sectors where you already own a ship of the appropriate colour (such as blue in Kermit).  Page me again if this is unclear or if you have other questions.  Cheers!

	Kermit: btw i didn't mean to sound like a pompous ass earlier. i just didn't know how much experience you had with the game. One time I played a multi game (which I prefer to the binary) and when I used sacrifice  two of the players quit because They thought I was being mean (they were new to the game, I didn't know). now i realize you know what you're doing so nevermind me.
	Uglyfoot: Don't worry about it.  I have a rather thick skin (& skull  ;> ).  I also realize that I am the worst player of Homeworlds on the site and will listen to any advice.  It HAS to be better than mine...

22) Kermit: Build B2 Kermit
	Kermit: I don't do as well in binary homeworlds. I have won the multi-game once or twice. The sacrifice is often the key ( for instance when you had three green ships at your home were I able to sac a yellow to make multiple moves it would have been the game. Another strategy is to move a small green to a 3 pip piece of another color just as storeage and when tht color is all gone you can sac the green 1 pip and build a 3 pip anywhere on the board you have a ship of that color.
	Kermit: but seeing those opportunities ahead of time is the trick. I don't always do that so well

	Kermit: Ouch, I seriously misread the rules on attacks. Oh well. From here on down its all uphill.

	Uglyfoot: did you guess it?

	Kermit: nope...I thought you were going to move the other b1 in and catostrophe the blues. I thought you were going to do that or something like it a while back (with the 2 pip yellow). If I had thought of that I could have done the same with my 1 pip red. ( a sign i wasn't thinking that way)
	Kermit: in any case my BIGGEST mistake was sacrificing my greens for the catastrophe wayyyy back and allowing you to build so many I couldn't really get back into the game. 
	Kermit: Good game.
	Uglyfoot: Thanks for the game!
