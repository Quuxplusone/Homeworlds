	goulo: Hi!

3) goulo: Build Y1 Goulo
	AdamBadura: Hi!
	AdamBadura: Sorry for the delay but SuperDuperGames emails got into spam so I found them today.

4) AdamBadura: Build R1 Adambadura
	goulo: I wondered if the email got lost like that. :)
	goulo: I am amused that our homesystems are named "goulo" and "AdamBadura". They could both sound sort of like science fiction star system names. :)

5) goulo: Build Y1 Goulo

6) AdamBadura: Build R1 Adambadura

7) goulo: Trade Y1 R1 Goulo
	AdamBadura: I wonder how this game will end... This time I plan to use a different approach. But I guess you will win anyway... ;)

8) AdamBadura: Trade R1 Y1 Adambadura

9) goulo: Discover Y1 Goulo G3 Austin

10) AdamBadura: Move R1 Adambadura Austin

11) goulo: Move Y1 Austin Goulo
	AdamBadura: Why there are so many spectators here? Do those people really follow the game or they just came once by accident?
	goulo: I think they just set some setting so that they automatically watch every game that starts.
 
By the way, if your "new approach" was "hope that Russ does something stupid", it's working OK so far. I didn't pay attention that both our homesystems connect to large stars...

18) AdamBadura: Build Y2 Adambadura
	AdamBadura: No. Nooooooooooo!!! How didn't I see that coming?! I must be really stupid. Especially that I remebered about this trick and I tried to prevent it.

19) goulo: Attack Y2 Adambadura
	AdamBadura: From my current observation the main problem in this game is when to allow your oponent to build 2 ship and which should it be. And this time I failed to time it properly... ;)

	goulo: It's only fair; I made a mistake earlier, so then you made a mistake. :)
	AdamBadura: No point in continuing. I will lose it. I must produce a ship each turn so you will not win by capturing my last ship. But I can produce only yellow ships and after making forth in this solar system you will make catastroph and leave me with no ships...
	goulo: Technically, you could also move your red ships back home, but I think that will not work out much better. :)
	AdamBadura: I could have moved my small red ship back and count on your mistake to capture the yellow one rather than the red one and to not sacrifice the large ship. If you did so than I could produce red ships and the catastrophe would free me of your attack. It would be even quite good situation. But it is doubtfull you would make that.
