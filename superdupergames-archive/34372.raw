	Laurie_Menke: Hi D5PA! Just wanted to let you know that I will be off grid starting today (8/24) until Monday (9/4). We have 4 games going, and all of them are hard time high stakes games. I'm going to try to find enough internet access to play once or twice during that time from my phone, but if I don't, I will have to forfeit those games. I don't like it, but can live with it if it happens.  ;)  Sorry for the timing problems... I thought we'd be done by now...

	Laurie_Menke: Darn it! I missed it by 3 minutes. Argh!  :(
	Laurie_Menke: Well, congratulations, D5PA. See you in our other games.
	Babamots: Sorry about the timeout! I wish I had thought to suggest pausing the timer when I heard about cutting it close with the trip.
	Laurie_Menke: No worries, Babamots. I should have remembered that trick myself!  (Though I'm not sure if D5PA would have agreed anyway...) There will be other games.  :)
