	TwoShort: Just in the realm of general strategy advice, red isn't useful until we're in contact, so taking much this early is odd unless you're trying to rush into it so fast I don't get any.  Dominating a color is a fine idea, but it's hard to do effectively with red.

15) TwoShort: Build Y2 Twoshort
	benji_stein: Makes sense, and I appreciate the tips. I took one just so I had one, and then decided it might be a good route into the 2pip ships.

Catastrophe Twoshort Green
	benji_stein: Yikes. I think this is my only move, though it's a painful one...

37) TwoShort: Trade Y3 R3 Twoshort
	benji_stein: Hmm. I thought I'd had one more ship somewhere. Well, now I'm trapped at my homeworld with only red, and I'm pretty sure there's nothing I can do to prevent you from biding your time and building up enough of a fleet to move in and catastrophe my system in one move.
	TwoShort: Yeah, this was the only way you could stop me from blowing you up immediately, but now you're stuck.  I can end it slightly faster than building up to the next catastrophe though...

	benji_stein: Well, if ou're going to do that, I'll at least take you out with me! :P

40) benji_stein: Build R1 Benji_stein
Catastrophe Benji_stein R
	TwoShort: Thanks for the game.  Sorry if I didn't come up with too much strategy advice, but I figure you got the part about paying attention to where your opponent can cause catastrophes :)
	benji_stein: That's fair. It's definitely something I sometimes don't catch. I probably should have waited a little longer in retaliating to catastrophe your homeworld. 
Good game. Care for another? (No is a fine answer, I won't take offense.) 
	TwoShort: I'm happy to play another, any time.
