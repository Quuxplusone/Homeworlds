	dethdukk: evening.  This is my first game using this system (SDG that is) and my first homeworlds game against anyone outside of my immediate friends group.  any suggestions or corrections at the end of the game would be appreciated

4) dethdukk: Build G1 Dethdukk
	TwoShort: Sure.  My typical approach with new players is to give them advice a little too late to actually help :) Only semi-intentionally though.  It's hard to know what advice to give in advance, and no fun just telling people what to do in any case.

5) TwoShort: Trade G1 Y1 Twoshort
	TwoShort: "evening"?  you must be in a different time zone than me :)

6) dethdukk: Build G1 Dethdukk
	dethdukk: I agree wholeheartedly.  As I said, END of the game.  I like to make my mistakes and learn from them, it helps imprint the lesson better.  In any case, I think I understand most of the basis, its the details that'll get me.

7) TwoShort: Build Y1 Twoshort
	dethdukk: I should have said "morning" or perhaps "afternoon".  I tend to greet peaple with evening no matter the time of day.  I am in the mountains.

8) dethdukk: Discover G1 Dethdukk B3 Lauch
	TwoShort: I don't always remember the advice at the end of the game, which is why I figure "too late to help" is equivalent.. for example, be careful about letting your opponent get the last 1 point of a color you don't have before you have any 2 pointers...

	TwoShort: Where in the mountains? (he wonders from Boulder, CO)
	dethdukk: Denver actually.  (gasps in astonishment as he realizes what just happened)

	dethdukk: there, that worked out pretty well...  not to get my number of greens down.  Thanks again for playing.  I understand that you are a rather high-level player, hopefully playing against a completely new person isnt too annoying :P
	dethdukk: hm... is there a way to get the past turns, or perhaps review the game as a whole?  I can save the pictures from here on out, but it would be nice to get the first few turns.
	dethdukk: for review.  I want the past turns so I can review how the game went.

14) dethdukk: Trade G2 Y2 Lauch
	TwoShort: You can step through past games once they are over by going to the homepage -> games history-> pick the specific game.

15) TwoShort: Discover G3 Twoshort B2 Bluebird
	dethdukk: thanks
	TwoShort: Oh, and as far as playing new players, I don't mind at all.  When people have no idea what they are doing it can be a little annoying because I don't always have time for a good tutorial, and I feel guilty just crushing them.  But using a factory to escape my yellow lock means you're well beyond that.

16) dethdukk: Trade G2 R2 Dethdukk
	dethdukk: So what you are saying is that you wont feel guilty after crushing me?  Oh, and I dont think you will get a bluebird on me.  Unless I have somehow mis-judged my position...

17) TwoShort: Build G2 Twoshort
	TwoShort: I tend to name systems by free association; I was vaguely worried you'd leave yourself open to a bluebird right after I said how well you were doing.  In any case, if I manage to crush you, I won't feel guilty at all :)

	dethdukk: so the point of the game is not neccesarily to kill off the other player in one stroke, but rather to cut them down slowly by gaining control of the ship stash.  which would mean that green is extremely important, yellow ia second most important, and perhaps even most important, red is helpfun but not needed except perhaps as surgical stikes, meant to cut someone out or a color, and blue is used almost exclusively for systems.
	dethdukk: yellow is second*, red is helpful*, any others I missed

31) TwoShort: Trade G2 R2 Twoshort
	TwoShort: 3 pointers are the most important :) But yes, barring any big blunders, you win by buildign enough of a ship advantage that the exact mechanics of finishing the guy off become academic.
 
Green is essential early, and devastating if you can get the only factory ( a g3 you can sac to build 2 ships and itself right back).
 
Yellow has the biggest ability to transform the board; getting most of the big ones will be a big advantage.
 
Blue is sometimes mostly systems like in this game, but there's a great strategy if you can get a complete monopoly (you can continually flip a b3 to something else and regrow it).
 
I've only once had a red monopoly.  Generally, you want an r2 (or 3, but a 2 is about as good) you can sacrifice somewhere, and "the gun rule" says you should take a red somewhere as soon as your opponent does.  This is excellent advice, even though I'm currently ignoring it :)

32) dethdukk: Move Y2 Grogar Colony
	dethdukk: I have been reading a bit...  you believe that a small/large homeworld is better than a small/medium homeworld correct?  Is this simply because you can explore mediums, and thus get to larges faster, or some other reason?  Also, red seems to be the starting color of choice over yellow nowadays.  I assume that that is simply because you can get a greater benifit out of a red system later on, where a yellow system looses its usefulness so long as you have even a single yellow ship.

	TwoShort: As far as goldilocks (1-3) vs. banker (1-2), I've probably changed my mind a half dozen times since I wrote that.  Today I think they are about comparable.  Both are better than Fortress (2-3). Certain good players (named Andy Looney) strongly prefer banker, and crush me with it. 
  I like the red-blue homeworld best, mostly because you can grow more green and yellow ships without getting close to a catastrophe.  The red is nice defensively, but that's secondary.

36) dethdukk: Build G2 Dethdukk
	dethdukk: thanks again for your help.  I have 3 more questions, all of them unrelated to this game:  Are you planning on going to origins?  do you play icehouse at all?  and would you play another homeworlds game against me after this one?

37) TwoShort: Move G3 Bonanza Dethdukk
	TwoShort: - I'm not going to Origins (young children, limited budget, other commitments).
- Back in the day (1992) I played vast amounts of Icehouse and was part of the team that won the fourth tournament.  I haven't played it much in years though.
 - I'm always happy to play more homeworlds.  I am going on vacation without net access the week after next, so if you start another game before then you'll wind up waiting a week for my next move at some point.
