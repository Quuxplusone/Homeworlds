face: was the "eek" just for show? i'm not sure if i can get out of this... should have build another r3 instead of the g2. may have to think about this one for a bit.
ZackStack: It was my initial reaction to the large red ships popping up all over my space... As you say, I might have found my one way out :-)

face: after staring at the board off and on for a couple of days, i figure you got me good. very well played. care to play another? i'll try to be more competative.
ZackStack: Dont sell yourself short! You played the ship supply part of the game better than I did... I just got after your Homeworld a little sooner. I'm looking forward to the rematch!
