Winner: Jesse

1) Jesse: Homeworld R1 B3 G3
	Jesse: Hello.  Welcome to SDG, and have a good game.

2) smilingra: Homeworld G1 B2 Y3

3) Jesse: Build G1 Jesse

4) smilingra: Build Y1 Smilingra

5) Jesse: Build G1 Jesse
	smilingra: Thanks for playing - this is my first game, so I'm interested to see how it will turn out!
	Jesse: Let me know if you have any questions.  I'm happy to help.

6) smilingra: Discover Y1 Smilingra G3 Alpha

7) Jesse: Trade G3 Y3 Jesse

8) smilingra: Trade Y3 G3 Smilingra
	Jesse: This may be a little advanced, but notice how trading my large for a yellow, rather than one of my smalls, has done a couple of things.  It allows me to shortly start building medium sized ships, and makes it difficult for you to get into the green economy.  See if you can figure out why I was able to do this, and you were not in a position to do the same thing with yellow.
	smilingra: trade y3 g3 smilingra

9) Jesse: Discover G1 Jesse B2 Broog
	smilingra: I understand how you can build medium sized ships, but I don't know how it makes it hard to get me into the green economy, as well as why I'm not in the same position with yellow.
	Jesse: If you now build a green ship in your homeworld, there will be 3 green pieces there.  One more, and it's an overpopulation.  I could sacrifice my Y3 to fly in a green piece and cause a catastrophe which costs you your defense and half your system.  If you didn't first get a ship of a different color there before this even happened, it would immediately cost you the game.  This is why trading your large ship for a green doesn't get you into the green economy easily.
	Jesse: You would do better to build green ships away from your homeworld, due to having a green system marker.  If you had a medium yellow there, it would be reasonable to trade it for a green, then move it to another system so you won't be in danger of a catastrophe when you try to build more greens.  The problem here is that there are still 2 more small yellows to build before you can even get a medium yellow piece to trade for green, and meanwhile I'll be building medium green ships.  (You generally don't want to move your large ship away from your homeworld, if you can help it, because it leaves you undefended.  You might try it briefly, to make another green piece, but it's risky, and you'll definitely need another ship there, first.)  So, it's hard to get into green without trading your large, too.
	Jesse: There's nothing wrong with a blue-green homeworld, by the way.  You just need to be aware that you don't want to keep green pieces there any more than you have to, just as I don't want to keep blue or red pieces in my homeworld.
	Jesse: Where your homeworld choice is problematic is that your small system marker is the same color as my initial ship.  That means it only takes two builds for me to exhaust the small green pieces, and there's very little you can do about it.
	Jesse: Is that instructive, or just overloading you?
	Jesse: disc g1 b2 Broog

10) smilingra: Build Y1 Alpha
	Jesse: Arr.  Not only the wrong syntax, but the wrong place as well.  How embarrassing.  XD

11) Jesse: Build G2 Broog
	smilingra: Actually, it does make sense.  I totally forgot that you could move in a fourth piece of a given color and cause a catastrophe.  I doubt that I'm going to win this game, but I'll chalk it up to a valuable learning experience. :)
	Jesse: You should be prepared to have continuing valuable learning experiences for a long time to come.  I know I still do.

12) smilingra: Move Y1 Alpha Smilingra

13) Jesse: Trade G2 Y2 Broog
	smilingra: Thanks for the pointers - keep 'em coming!

14) smilingra: Discover G3 Smilingra R3 Gamma
	Jesse: This move diversifies my holdings at Broog, and gives me greater mobility.  Y2s are nice, because they extend your reach with a piece that you can sacrifice a lot more easily than a large, especially early on.  This also leaves the last Y1 still in the pool, so if you build it, I can grab another Y2 directly.  (And if you grabbed the other, a large would be available for me.)
	Jesse: If you would like a sporting chance, I'll give you the opportunity to build a G2 in your home system.  Instead of immediately smashing you, I'll make a build of my own to give you the opportunity to fix your green concentration.

15) Jesse: Build G2 Broog
	smilingra: Thanks for the offer, but I'm going to still make the move I wanted to, just to see how it will pan out.  I'm just stubborn that way. :)
	smilingra: Still, if you'd like to prolong my demise, you could point out how you could blow me away. :)
	Jesse: If you'd rather play it out straight up, that is absolutely fine by me.  I was referring to blowing you away if you just built a green in your home system.  I cannot immediately blow you away, in the current position.

16) smilingra: Build Y1 Smilingra
	Jesse: Although, now that I have a second green ship one step from Gamma, if you build another green there I can blow your green ships away at the cost of everything at Broog.  Leaving you without a large ship would be quite advantageous, even if it doesn't take out half your home system.
	Jesse: It's worth noting additionally that it is quite dangerous to leave your home system without the defense of a large ship.  Consider what happens when I now sacrifice my Y2 to move my G2 into your system.

17) Jesse: Build Y2 Jesse
	smilingra: I'm now beginning to understand how using up the supply of small ships is critical.  At this point, I can see that I'm in big trouble.
	smilingra: Although, my system is not connected to Broog, so your g2 can't get to my system, correct?
	Jesse: Broog is two steps from your home system, so I would have to sacrifice the Y2.

18) smilingra: Build Y2 Alpha

19) Jesse: Build Y3 Broog
	smilingra: Ah, it had not occurred to me that you could move one ships twice.  I think I'm learning something on every move! :)
	Jesse: Yup, you get N completely independent actions to use when you sacrifice.  Also note that the sacrificed ship goes back into the pool before you do any of the actions.

20) smilingra: Move Y1 Smilingra Gamma
	Jesse: Notice that with two yellow ships in each of your systems with yellows, building the remaining Y3 will put you close to an overconcentration.

21) Jesse: Trade G2 R2 Broog
	smilingra: Yes, I'm painfully aware of that. :)
	Jesse: Just making sure.  Now, what's the next lesson?  Hmm...
	Jesse: The Banker is tempting, taking that Y3 out of circulation by sending my g2 to a Y3 system.  That would work towards increasing my material advantage.  But I think, actually, a sharper threat is in order.  Something to drive home the importance of keeping your home system protected.

22) smilingra: Build Y3 Smilingra
	Jesse: Hmm, I should have traded the Y2, instead, to keep the Y3 in the stash one more step away.  In any case, there are two important proverbs that apply here: Never leave your homeworld undefended; and, When your opponent picks up a gun, you must pick up a gun.  You can take care of either one with one turn, but not both.  After my next turn, you will likely find yourself with my Y3 in your home system, ready to capture two ships with the sacrifice of the R2.  What you would like very much to have is a large ship and a red of your own there, to capture it first.  But since you can only get one of those things, you're a move behind.

23) Jesse: Sacrifice Y2 Jesse
Move Y3 Broog Alpha
Move Y3 Alpha Smilingra

24) smilingra: Trade Y3 R3 Smilingra
	smilingra: Yes, you've made it *painfully* obvious that I need to defend my homeworld.  I know that I need to have a large ship in my homeworld area; otherwise, you can take me over.  At least I recognized (thanks to your comment) that I can build a y3 there, thus allowing me to have two large ships.  I at least get to hang on for a couple more turns this way. :)

25) Jesse: Sacrifice R2 Broog
Attack R3 Smilingra
Attack Y1 Smilingra

	Jesse: So, now you see where being a move late in picking up a gun can kill you.  Not a bad first game, especially given that you stumbled into that problem early on with the greens, which I would not expect a new player to see coming anyway.  If you want another game, you're welcome to it.
	Jesse: By the way, I think the move you could have made to last the longest would have been: Sacrifice your Y2.  Move your G3 and a Y1 into your home system.  Trigger a yellow catastrophe, wiping out my attacking Y3.  That leaves you with just a G3 and a Y1, and the same trouble developing that you had before, but it would take me a few turns to get into a position in which I could attack again.
	smilingra: Thanks for all the pointers!  I'm going to accept a new challenge.  I was wondering about how to prolong the game - I hadn't thought about the catastrophe!
