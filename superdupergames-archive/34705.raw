	Babamots: I'm still careless and rusty. It's possible you didn't see or didn't like your early catastrophe opportunity back there, but I didn't notice until after you passed it up.

16) Felix: Build B1 Out

17) Babamots: Move B3 Babamots Ferenginar
	Felix: Yeah, I saw that, but I didn't like where it would have left me if I took the opportunity. And I miss things like that too sometimes. It's part of the difficulty of playing such spaced out moves instead of realtime. I often have to stare at the game for quite some time before each move to remember where all the threats are, and if I'm in a hurry, I make mistakes

	Babamots: Now, I don't want to see you pulling any punches just because my confidence has been slacking. Especially since I haven't been concentrating on this game very hard, I'm surprised to have come back so well.

36) Felix: Build Y1 Opus
	Felix: No punches pulled. I honestly just couldn't see a good way to make good on my advantage without leaving myself in a worse position. I should have tried harder to get a large ship into your system, but it wasn't easy. nice recovery!

Trade Y1 B1 Opus
Catastrophe Opus B
	Babamots: I think it's a good defense of your home under the circumstances, but I don't think it deals with the Opus Crisis satisfactorily.
	Babamots: On my previous move, rather than advancing my b3, I wanted to build a b2 in opus just to see what would happen, but I figured it was safer to put you on the defensive for a move.

48) Felix: Build R1 Felix
	Felix: Yeah I think I screwed the pooch on this one!

	Babamots: I think this way gives you less room for annoying prolongation.
	Felix: I think you're right. No sense in prolonging it. Well played! I made some major mistakes in not capitalizing when I had you against the wall. Nice recovery and good game!
	Babamots: I'm pretty surprised that swung my way. GG!
