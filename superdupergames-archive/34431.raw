4) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	dlwillson: Congrats on the new kid!
 
I'm doing well. Been interviewing for a new job, and learning the new crop of technology. Mostly, Kubernetes, Prometheus, OpenStack, and GitLab.

Wow, sounds like a lot to learn! And here I am, still doing most of my work in PHP :)

My Software Freedom School project is doing a cap at the end of the month and we're still 4 campers short of a cabin-full

	Felix: Looks awesome! I know I'd really enjoy it, but I don't know if my boss or his company has the time or money to invest in it at the moment. Is this something you do yearly, or quarterly or anything? I'll show it to him and see what he thinks! 

7) dlwillson: Build G1 Dlwillson

8) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	dlwillson: We run a camp annually, but this is our first DevOps Camp. Not sure what we'll run next year. We have scholarship funds available for woman technologists. Some of the board-members did a fund-raiser for a couple of their friends, but then the friends backed out. So weird. But, it's a great opportunity for some young gal who wants to learn this stuph.

9) dlwillson: T G1 B1 Dlwillson
	Felix: At the moment, I don't know any women who are remotely interested in this stuph, haha. Well good luck with the camp! If nothing else I'd just love the chance to do some camping in Colorado! Still haven't been.
