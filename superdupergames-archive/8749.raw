	TwoShort: Well, besides an accidental time-out over my summer vacation, Mike Yarrum beat me in May.  He played a really excellent game right after losing a couple via newbie blunders that lulled me into a false sense of security.  Unfortunately, I already know you're pretty good :)

	mneme: I'd kinda rather you had gone for the quick kill -- dropping a 3 in my home system the turn after the catastrophe.  Why didn't you?

	TwoShort: I'd have gone for it if I thought it would work :)  Let's see... After you flipped your 2 to yellow, if I sacrificed one of my y3s to put the other one in your homeworld, you could have sacrificed your g3 to build a two yellows (and a b2), causing a catastrophe and leaving nobody with any 3s.  So, not a kill, and while I'd have been at an advantage, I think I'm at a bigger one this way.
	TwoShort: I was fully expecting to go for the kill, and when you traded to yellow I was surprised and impressed you found the way to fend me off.

54) mneme: Build B2 Mneme
	mneme: Fair enough -- I did flip to green to try to head you off for a few more turns.  Very much a forgone conclusion at this point, though.
