Homeworlds Online (SDG# 30934)
Started: 2016.12.23, Ended: 2017.1.10
Participants: Felix (S), Draw5PlayAll (N)
Winner: Felix

1) Draw5PlayAll: Homeworld B3 R1 G3
	Draw5PlayAll: I think I will lose that other game. This time I am not going so extreme on the yellows.

2) Felix: H Y2 B3 G3
	Draw5PlayAll: And if you want me to vary my start, do not let me go first and choose a 1-3 homeworld.
	Felix: It's up to you whether you vary your start! And whoever goes first is chosen randomly.

3) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: But why do you repeat the B3? Shouldn't you have flipped the colors of your stars?

4) Felix: B G1 Felix

5) Draw5PlayAll: Trade G1 Y1 Draw5playall

6) Felix: Trade G1 Y1 Felix
	Felix: *Shrug* I'm not sure why it matters if I flip them or not :) There will just be fewer B3s available now.

7) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: For an extreme example see my game vs mi_spero who chose an R1 when that was already there.

8) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	Felix: That can sometimes be used strategically to one's own advantage. I will often choose a b1 on purpose if my opponent starts with a b1. Combining that with a b3 starter can give one an effective boost into dominating blue.

9) Draw5PlayAll: Discover G1 Draw5playall B2 B2
	Draw5PlayAll: So you start with a double blue??

10) Felix: Trade G1 B1 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: Basically I need to be sure I get every color and a good supply of them. G and Y are easy since I can have them in my HW without fear of a 4-boom.
	Draw5PlayAll: ...blowing up one of my stars, that is.
	Felix: Yep, start with a b1/g2 or b1/g3 homeworld and a b3 ship. It's unorthodox but it has worked very effectively. There's an epic game between wil and twoshort where twoshort used it to great effect. I'll see if I can find it.

11) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall
	Felix: Ah, it was Endo, not TwoShort. Here it is: http://superdupergames.org/?page=archive_play&gid=28818&idx=0
 
Simply divine.

12) Felix: Build B1 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: Interesting, but (1) I dislike green homeworld stars and (2) I only use B3 (not B1) stars unless I am going second.
 
I like setting up the Factory in my homeworld, and then using yellow ships for extra defense.

13) Draw5PlayAll: Trade G1 B1 Draw5playall
	Felix: I agree with the green homeworld thing in general, but being unpredictable has its benefits :)

35) Draw5PlayAll: Sacrifice G3 Draw5playall
Build Y2 Draw5playall
Build Y3 R2

Trade B3 Y3 Arrakis

37) Draw5PlayAll: Sacrifice G3 Draw5playall
Build G3 Draw5playall
Build G3 R2

	Draw5PlayAll: I can do this though
	Draw5PlayAll: No!
	Draw5PlayAll: You only get one undo...

38) Felix: Trade Y3 R3 Arrakis
	Felix: I ended up doing the same move anyway. And who says you only get one undo? You can undo every move one time.

39) Draw5PlayAll: Build R1 B2
	Draw5PlayAll: 1. I meant one undo per turn, yeah.
2. I need to snag those "sac G3 build all one color" things more often and maybe I won't lose vs you.

40) Felix: Sacrifice G3 Felix
Build Y3 Bazoik
Build B3 Bazoik
Build G3 Felix
	Felix: You might not lose even as is. I got hung up for a long time on that move and I'm still not sure I made a good one.

41) Draw5PlayAll: Sacrifice Y2 Draw5playall
Move R2 B2 Arrakis
Move R1 B2 Arrakis
Catastrophe Arrakis Red

53) Draw5PlayAll: Move G2 R2 Y1

54) Felix: Move Y3 Arrakis B2
	Draw5PlayAll: This is probably resignable...

55) Draw5PlayAll: Sacrifice G2 B2
Build G2 Y1
Build R1 Y1
	Felix: It could be interesting to play out, but it's up to you!

56) Felix: Sacrifice Y2 Arrakis
Move Y3 B2 Y1
Move B3 Bazoik Y1

	Felix: I would have been interested to see how it played out, but I think I would have had you in the end so that was probably a good call. Good game though! It took me quite a large number of games to get a firm grasp on the "long game" and develop a winning fleet from turn 1. I'm not always good at it, but practice, practice, practice. Look forward to our rematch!
	Draw5PlayAll: I need something of every color, but I need to watch those "color bombs" where someone sacs a G3 and builds all blue or yellow. Yellow and red seem to be my weak points.
