Participants: Keith (S), papa_bear (N)
Winner: Keith

1) papa_bear: Homeworld G2 B1 Y3
papa_bear: Hi.

2) Keith: Homeworld B1 Y3 G3
Keith: Hello papa_bear.

3) papa_bear: Build Y1 Papa_bear
papa_bear: Have you played this before? I know I could check your profile, but it would take so long to load :)

4) Keith: Build G1 Keith
Keith: The page load times can be a bear. This is my 23rd game. My track record is 15-7.

5) papa_bear: Trade Y1 G1 Papa_bear
papa_bear: Intimidating. I'm watching and learning...

6) Keith: Trade G1 B1 Keith
Keith: Have you played before? We can make it an unrated game if you want.

7) papa_bear: Build Y1 Papa_bear
papa_bear: build y1 papa_bear
papa_bear: Boy that was stupid.

8) Keith: Build G1 Keith
papa_bear: It is my first time, but I am happy to leave it rated. I came to SDG to play Castle Danger. That's the only game in which my rating matters much to me. I will try my best in other games, though, for the sport of it if not for the rating. I think I figured out why your first ship was a g3. Are you going to sacrifice it relatively early to get ahead on production?
Keith: I will leave the game a rated one then. I came to SDG to play Cannon and discovered Homeworlds which has become my strong second interest. Matt is currently schooling me in the ways of Castle Danger.

Keith: You are sort of on the right track with the g3. I will eventually sacrifice it for growth but not now for two reasons. 1) it would leave me without a 3-pointer to defend my homeworld and 2) If I did it now it is a one shot deal. I want to be able to recruit a g3 when I sacrifice it so I can repeat the process.

Keith: I started off this game playing hardball. For example I just made it more difficult for you to develop blue.


9) papa_bear: Build Y1 Papa_bear
papa_bear: I think I can just begin to see the kind of complexities involved in playing this game well. I have not been thinking seriously about the limitations on the global reserve stash. I have little notion what to do next, but I will think of something...

10) Keith: Trade G1 Y1 Keith
Keith: Resource management (both acquisition and distribution) is a substantial part of the game. The resource management aspect is part of why I tried Castle Danger.

Keith: What to do in Homeworlds after you get started comes up often enough that there is an entry on it in the wiki.

11) papa_bear: Build G1 Papa_bear
papa_bear: build g1 papa_bear
papa_bear: Oops. Second time for that idiocy. By the way, did you enjoy Castle Danger?

12) Keith: Build G1 Keith
Keith: I am enjoying Castle Danger. I like the piece entry decision each turn and the space management.

13) papa_bear: Trade Y1 R1 Papa_bear

14) Keith: Build B2 Keith
papa_bear: I am very happy if you like Castle Danger. I hope it will catch on. Personally, I think it's a great game.

15) papa_bear: Build R1 Papa_bear
papa_bear: Oh... I thought all the 1-point pieces had to go before we could build 2-point ships.

16) Keith: Trade B2 R2 Keith
Keith: All the 1-point pieces of that color. To put it another way you build the smallest available piece of the color being built.
Keith: A green 2-pointer is available to you but your green piece density in your homeworld does not allow you to safely build one there.

17) papa_bear: Build R1 Papa_bear

18) Keith: Discover G1 Keith R2 Mustafar

19) papa_bear: Discover R1 Papa_bear B3 Mahalalel

20) Keith: Build G2 Keith
Keith: Mahalalel = Genesis 5:12-17

21) papa_bear: Move G1 Papa_bear Mahalalel
papa_bear: Do you celebrate Christmas because you celebrate Christ?

22) Keith: Sacrifice G3 Keith
Build G2 Mustafar
Build G3 Keith
Build B2 Keith
Keith: Yes. Though I am no longer the Bible thumping no smoking, no drinking, no dancing, sin and damnation hard core Southern Baptist I was raised to be.

23) papa_bear: Build G3 Mahalalel
Keith: I am now operating what is known as "the factory."
papa_bear: Now, if I were a hardcore Southern Baptist I might feel insulted. I'm not, though. But to compare to your checklist: I'm cool with moderate drinking. I can't justify even moderate smoking, as hard as I've tried. I used to be a smoker, and even after I came to the conclusion that there was no justification for it, it took me a long time to quit. I don't dance, but that's not an ethical thing. Well, maybe it is: it would be wrong to subject people to seeing me try to dance :). I take sin and damnation very seriously, but I think that doing nothing but yelling at people about their sins is itself a sinful thing to do, as well as counterproductive and unbiblical. I'm not positive what Bible-thumping is, but I'm probably guilty of that one. I derive all my doctrine, as much as possible, from the Bible rather than from other sources. That might make me a thumper.
papa_bear: By naming that new system "Mahalalel" I was putting up a flag. I'm glad to know that we celebrate Christmas for the same reason.
papa_bear: Will you be sacrificing those g2's soon? I need to think a bit before I proceed with my next turn.
Keith: Moderate drinking is okay. I never get around to it much because I don't like beer.

Keith: Smoking is flat out. I have seen what it does to lung tissue, the amount of money people spend in a year on smoking instead of their families and what it does to work productivity (smoke breaks, working one handed).

Keith: Dancing. I have tried it. Never liked it. Even with more than moderate drink in me.

Keith: I grew up with hell fire and damnation sermons. One example of my Bible thumping was going out to Mardi Gras parades and trying to convert parade goers.


Keith: I am not likely to sacrifice a g2 soon. I need to keep a second green with the g3 so I can sacrifice and re-build the g3.
papa_bear: Wow. That is hardcore. If Bible-thumping involves thumping others with the Bible, then I'm not in that camp. I am a hundred percent with you on smoking. I hate to think how much money I wasted on cigarrettes. Every dollar could have gone to my kids instead, or to any of the millions of people around the world with insufficient food, medical care, and other necessities. I have a confession: I like whiskey. I drink only rarely and never much, but I feel I have to be very careful with a strong drink. It would be easy to consume more than I intend.
papa_bear: About the sacrificing ships, I see now. I had forgotten that new g3 was destined for sacrifice.

24) Keith: Move B2 Keith Mustafar
Keith: We are on the same page when it comes to whiskey. I do drink sake. I usually get a bottle on my birthday and for Christmas.
Keith: I have worked myself into a bit of a corner. If I build the g3 in Keith then you can sacrifice your y3, move a g1 into Keith and cause a catastrophe destroying all my green in Keith. More importantly it would leave me without a 3-pointer. If I don't grab the g3 you will and you will have three 3-pointers to my one. If I build the g3 in Mustafar you can sacrifice a y1 and cause a green catastrophe.

25) papa_bear: Sacrifice G3 Mahalalel
Build G3 Mahalalel
Build Y1 Papa_bear
Build R2 Papa_bear
papa_bear: Well, giving your opponent advice may not be part of a healthy strategy ;)

26) Keith: Sacrifice G3 Keith
Build G3 Keith
Build R3 Keith
Build Y2 Keith
Keith: True. Can't really describe it as wise. I am more interested in your learning curve than my rating points.

27) papa_bear: Move Y1 Papa_bear Mahalalel
papa_bear: That's very much appreciated, Keith. However, in the unlikely event that this game terminates in my favor, I would insist it do so unrated. As when Solomon received both wisdom and riches, so you would enjoy both the opportunity to help me and also that for which you had not asked: a safe rating :)
Keith: My concern is that this game is has run on the dull side for you. There is a certain common experience of "Okay I am building a bunch of ships now what" though it is usually punctuated by more threats and less buildup than the present case.
Keith: Your offer if the game goes in your favor is appreciated. I will endeavor to not have the issue come up.

28) Keith: Move Y1 Keith Mustafar
papa_bear: I expect nothing less from you :)
papa_bear: I hope this turn was safe enough. Sacrificing either my g3 or my y3 was tempting, but in either case I think I would have been falling into a trap. Let me know if I'm thinking along the right lines. If I sacrifice y3 and move a y1 into Keith and trigger the catastrophe, your r3 can then, thanks to the collapse of your y3 star, enter Mahalalel and reorient my g3. If I sacrifice my g3, any combination of 3 ships I might build would necessarily leave one or the other of my systems vulnerable to catastrophe.
papa_bear: There's no danger of boredom here. I can feel the tension in the game. Non-chessplayers sometimes think it involves tremendous patience to play chess, but when you're really playing it no patience is required. I think it's the same here. I'm new to the game, but -- thanks in large part to a kind and instructive opponent -- I am gaining some sense of the thrusts and parries which can occur under the surface of a "buildup" game of Homeworlds.
Keith: It is best you did not make either sacrifice. You are right about the g3 sacrifice. I am going to go ahead and go into a lengthy explanation, even thought this is a rated game since the move is past. I will leave the explanation up until I make my move tomorrow to make it easier to track with the current board position.

Keith: The y3 is more complicated. It is good that your are keeping in mind that distances between systems would change. However, if I followed a yellow homeworld catastrophe by moving my r3 into Mahalalel you would be able to reorient my r3. Your r1 in Mahalalel gives any of your ships in that system the power to attack just as a yellow ship gives any friendly local ship the power to move, in this case your g3.

Keith: The y3 sacrifice would be expensive for you. You would lose a y3 and y1, I would lose a y2, y1, and a system. I follow up by trading for a y2 in Mustafar. If you retreat your g3 I sacrifice my y2, move a g1 into your homeworld and green catastrophe. You have are down one system, your remaining system is blue and I have a head start on blue ships and you have no 3-pointers while I have two. The end is near. If you don't move your g3 back then I sacrifice my y2 and move in one of my 3-pointers in. If I move in the g3 you have to destroy it or I will sacrifice my r2 next attack your r2 and g1 and the end is near. Your only defense would be to build a green and blow up your own ships and system along with my g3. Alternatively I move the r3 in and trigger a red catastrophe and your home system is down to only a g1 ship. Your in a lot more trouble than your original yellow catastrophe put me in.

papa_bear: Immediately after I made the move and sent the message, I realized that you couldn't move the r3 and attack the g3 on the same turn. But I wasn't sure whether that meant the y3 sacrifice was a good idea. I was pretty sure you wouldn't have allowed it if it was. Thanks for your explanation.

29) papa_bear: Trade R2 B2 Papa_bear

30) Keith: Move G2 Mustafar Mahalalel

31) papa_bear: Sacrifice Y1 Mahalalel
Move G3 Mahalalel Mustafar
papa_bear: Am I correct in thinking that I'm in trouble here?
papa_bear: Don't answer that, actually.

32) Keith: Sacrifice R2 Keith
Attack R1 Mahalalel
Attack G1 Mahalalel
papa_bear: Most unsatisfactory, but I couldn't see much else.
Keith: You were going to suffer some loss. Though I am not sure why you moved the g1 and b2 into Mahalalel. I can attack them by sacrificing my r3. Here were a few possibile alternatives.

Keith: move g3 mahalalel mustafar - you threaten to attack my ships in mustafar while I attack your ships in Mahalalel.

Keith: Sacrifice your g1 in Mahalalel and pass on the build leaving only two greens in Mahalalel and I can't cause a green catastrophe next turn.

Keith: Sacrifice the y1 in Mahalalel and discover a new system with the g3. The g3 is safe and only two 1-point ships of yours remain for me to attack.

Keith: Sacrifice the g3, build two green ships in Mahalalel and either a y2 or r2. Cause a green catastrophe in Mahalalel.
Keith: Feel free to undo and give any of these a try if you want. The g1 sacrifice below also puts the g1 back in the stash and prevents my building a g3 in Mustafar.
papa_bear: Ah. I forgot that a sacrifice allows you to perform activities in any system you occupy. I also had not considered sacrificing one of my ships and passing on the available activity. I did consider discovering with my g3 or moving it to Mustafar, but I felt uncomfortable having to put it in a 2-pt system where it is closer to your Homeworld than to mine. Would discovering with the g3 require the sacrifice of the y1? Can't it move anyway since I have access to yellow technology in that system? I will undo, but I'm not sure which course I'll choose. Preventing you from building a g3 sounds good, but so does moving g3 to Mustafar and attacking. I'll think about it some more while I await your next message.
Keith: You don't really need to sacrifice the y1 to move the g3 out. It is just a way of denying me the y1. I could catastrophe the g3 if it ends up at Mustafar. I could not build two more green ships there to cause the catastrophe because there is only one left in the stash. To do so I would need to sacrfice a y2, a g2, another g2 and lose the g1 already there. Expensive.
papa_bear: Cool. That y1 sacrifice is a nifty finesse. But I'm still not sure which course I want to choose. I'll probably move tomorrow morning (GMT+8).
Keith: No rush. I am plenty busy. You see there is this other finished game where I am consuming lots of time with some very enjoyable analysis...
papa_bear: Sounds familiar. Odd that a game in progress is sitting, while a finished game is consuming time and energy...

33) papa_bear: Attack B2 Mustafar
Keith: I just spotted another way to go after your g3 at Mustafar. Since I did not mention it I before I won't take it. There is only one green in the stash now but if I sacrifice the g2 at Keith there is now two greens in the stash and I can build them both in Mustafar and create a green catasrophe.

34) Keith: Move Y1 Mustafar Mahalalel

35) papa_bear: Build B2 Mustafar

36) Keith: Sacrifice Y2 Keith
Move Y1 Mahalalel Papa_bear
Move G1 Mahalalel Papa_bear

37) papa_bear: Trade Y3 B3 Papa_bear
Keith: Looks like I am headed for a blue catastrophe in Keith. Here is a distraction for you.

38) Keith: Sacrifice G2 Mahalalel
Build G2 Papa_bear
Build Y1 Papa_bear
Catastrophe Papa_bear Green
papa_bear: That certainly gives me something to think about. However, I wasn't so much planning a blue catastrophe. It seems to me that two 2pt ships would be a heavy cost, and I'm not sure that closing the distance between our homeworlds would be in my favor. Of course, that's all history. Now I need to do something about your invasion before it has catastrophic consequences...

39) papa_bear: Trade B3 G3 Papa_bear
Keith: I commend you on keeping the change in distance between homeworlds in mind. Most players learn that one the hard way.

Keith: Another thing to keep in mind in choosing how to deal with my invastion of your homeworld system is that I can use your system piece colors as well as my ship colors without having to resort to sacrifices.

40) Keith: Sacrifice B1 Keith
Trade Y1 B1 Papa_bear
papa_bear: Oh that's ugly.

41) papa_bear: Attack Y1 Papa_bear
Keith: It is. It was tempting last turn to trade the y1 for a blue and blue catastrophe instead. I see that you have taken the move that directly avoids that.

42) Keith: Sacrifice R3 Keith
Attack R1 Papa_bear
Attack R1 Papa_bear
Attack Y1 Papa_bear

43) papa_bear: Trade B2 G2 Papa_bear

44) Keith: Sacrifice G2 Keith
Build B2 Papa_bear
Build B3 Papa_bear
Catastrophe Papa_bear Blue
papa_bear: Argh.

Keith: Once there gets to be a lot of ships the possiblities two or three moves out get pretty wild.
Keith: Thank you for the game. You see things better than most first time Homeworlds players.

Keith: I hope this game gave you a good glimpse of Homeworlds and you found it worth further play. I don't want my playing rough the last three turns to be discouraging.
papa_bear: I keep overlooking that sacrifices give you access to that technology in all occupied systems.
papa_bear: No, your playing rough is not discouraging. If I may quote another of my pearls of wisdom which I so graciously bestow upon my young students: Always play your best moves, even against beginners; it's the best way for them to learn.
papa_bear: So far from being discouraging, your playing hard was encouraging, in the sense that it helped me see the possibilities in this game. My interest is definitely excited.
papa_bear: However, I have not long to go before my next semester of classes starts (I'm a student myself), and I think I'm going to hold off getting into Homeworlds for a while. My time is going to running very short very soon.
