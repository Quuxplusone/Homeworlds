Laurie_Menke: OK, so I really need to review some of the archived games to see what I'm supposed to be doing. I still don't seem to have a clue what I should be trying to do from turn to turn.
Laurie_Menke: I know this game is nearing an end, and I really appreciate your willingness to play with me. I'm going to lay low for a while and hopefully the next time we meet I'll be more ready to be a challenge for you. Happy gaming!

26) Laurie_Menke: Trade G3 R3 Laurie_menke
TwoShort: I'm still learning myself, I'm just a few pages ahead of you. I'll throw out a couple salient points I've discovered so far:
TwoShort: 1. It's all about green and yellow. If you can cut off, or severely restrict, your opponents access to one of those, you've got them.
TwoShort: 2. After that, it's all about 3 pointers. A 3 pointer gives you the potential to make such a sweeping change to the board when you sacrifice it, that the player with even one more of them has a big advantage.

TwoShort: Besides that, it's just assorted little tricks; primarily the one I used here: sacrifive a 3 point green to grow itself back again, two other peices besides. All I'm doing from turn to turn in the early game is trying to set up the timing so I'll be the first one able to do this.
Laurie_Menke: All very good advice...thank you! I was starting to get the idea about green and yellow, but I'm still very unaware of my sacrificing possibilities.

28) Laurie_Menke: Trade R3 G3 Laurie_menke
Laurie_Menke: Now I'm just feeling stupid...since I only have one ship, I can't go anywhere, so my options are building or trading. When I had the green, I couldn't build because you've got all the greens. With the red, I can't build because I have no green. So I just keep trading ships...LOL!

29) TwoShort: Move G3 Troublemaker Laurie_menke
TwoShort: You could have built last turn, but then I could have moved in and caused a catastrophe. But you switched to red, forcing me to stall for a turn until you flipped back.
