74) ts52: Pass

75) Draw5PlayAll: Pass
	ts52: Ok. I accept the draw.
	Babamots: To make it so the draw doesn't take rank points away from either of you, one of you will need to make the game "unranked." You need to send a server command here in the chat area:
 
~variant add Unranked
 
The other player will need to accept that change from their home page.
 
Draw5, since you issued the challenge, will you please enter the result in the "Game Finish Form?" Then we'll find out if my spreadsheet correctly gives tournament points for draws :-).
 
Lastly, the rules say the last player to move should resign to end the game. Since that's you ts52, will you please resign (after the game is set to Unranked)?
 
Thanks guys!
	Draw5PlayAll: Babamots: The variant is Unrated, not Unranked. Also, I seem to have lost the game forms.

	Draw5PlayAll: Passing so that ts52 gets informed.
	Babamots: Oh, "unrated"! Thanks!
Here's a page with links to everything tournament related:

	ts52: Ok, I believe I've accepted the 'unranked' setting change, once I see that here, I'll resign.
	ts52: unrated. Anyway, good game!
