	Simon: Hmm, the game felt comfortable since turn 12, I kept the extra large without any downsides.
	Laurie_Menke: Yeah, you are definitely the better player! Congrats on the win and thanks for the fun!  :)
	Simon: Thanks for the game too! Recently, I saw that you work with the Looneys and helped Andy with the 30-minute tutorial video. It's a great resource to spread the love (not everybody likes the raw game rules for bedtime reading...)
	Laurie_Menke: Yep. I pretty much eat, sleep, and breathe Looney Labs. My title at Looney Labs is Personal Assistant to the Looneys and New Markets. But I also live in their house (my title there is House Elf). And I am on the road with them about 120 days out of the year demoing games and creating new sales opportunities. It's a pretty great job!  :)  I'm glad you liked the tutorial! I only had a little bit to do with that. It was mostly Andy and his nephew, Eric. You may enjoy the Homeworlds Theater series as well. That's Andy and the inventor of Homeworlds (John Cooper) analyzing a playthrough like sportscasters. It's pretty entertaining, and all of the games are taken from right here on SDG.  :)  Thanks again for the fun, and I look forward to getting good enough to beat you one of these days!  :)
