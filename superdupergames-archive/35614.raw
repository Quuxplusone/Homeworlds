-Daniel

5) Felix: Trade B1 R1 Felix
	dlwillson: Hi Daniel :-)
 
That new guy is pretty tough, huh? Like Babamots and ... Another player whose name can't call to mind. Things are good. New job. SFS is going pretty well. We're doing our one-day intro to DevOps on Saturday. Pretty big deal for us.
	Felix: Indeed! Simon's doing very well lately. He's been impressing me very much with the r1 g3 b3 opening. Hence me trying to use it here with you :) I've lost to it twice in a row now. It's unusual enough to throw off players who are used to scrambling for blue or yellow to target the opponents homeworld with catastrophe.
 
Jonathan (Babamots) is really getting good too. It's nice to see more players really pushing the skill envelope upward!
 
Sounds exciting. Congrats on the new job! I'm just being a dad over here. Gearing up for our third kiddo to arrive in late November. We moved into a new house too, so lots to do there! Always busy, but always enough time for a game or two of Homeworlds :)

	dlwillson: I think TeeTeeTee is the strong player whose name I couldn't think of earlier.
	dlwillson: You know I only recently realized that you and Daniel Sellers from the Homeworlds Game Platform project are the same guy.
 
It's like Superman / Clark Kent. The cape and glasses really do change the appearance.
	Felix: Yep, that's me! Felix is an old screen-name I've used for years (Back when forums were the greatest thing on the internet, hehe)
 
TeeTeeTee is the strongest player I've played against. Never beaten him! I wonder where he's been?

	dlwillson: Thank you for an excellent game, as always, Mr. Sellers!
