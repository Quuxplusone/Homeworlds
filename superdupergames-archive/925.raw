28) MatrixFrog: Discover B1 Pad G2 Epsilon
	Pat: Aww: sorry 'bout that, guys. I got stranded without internet all of a sudden. Maybe I'll join in next game .P
	Evilaxe: Sorry. I thought you'd given up interest. Certainly wouldn't have forced resignation if I'd known.

29) Evilaxe: Trade Y1 G1 Evilaxe
	MatrixFrog: Hm. Pat's homeworld is going to be extremely difficult to take over...

30) MatrixFrog: Build B1 Epsilon
	MatrixFrog: If someone doesn't go in there and catastrophize all the red ships, the other player is likely to do it for them. So either those ships will all sit idle for the rest of the game, or else we'll be playing the "No you first" game until the end, I think.

31) Evilaxe: Trade Y3 B3 Evilaxe
	Evilaxe: I'll take your word for it. I was planning an attack run on the remains of Pat, but I think I'll take your advice instead.
	MatrixFrog: Well so was I, but I realized that as soon as I got a red ship in there, you would probably trigger a catastrophe to prevent me from getting all those pieces. And vice versa... of course, one never knows what an opponent will do, so perhaps it's worth the risk under certain circumstances.

35) Evilaxe: Discover R1 Magrathea R2 Nohope
	Pat: Hey: no hard feelings .) Really. And looking at it, it should be an interesting game now that I'm not actually moving anymore. I'll be keeping tabs on y'all.
	MatrixFrog: I'm not entirely sure why I moved my blue ship out. It seems like it would have been more useful where it was.

36) MatrixFrog: Move R2 Matrixfrog Evilaxe
	MatrixFrog: KABOOM!

	Evilaxe: ooops. Shoulda seen that.

37) Evilaxe: Build R3 Evilaxe
	MatrixFrog: That's a happy thought.

38) MatrixFrog: Sacrifice B1 Sigma
Trade R2 G2 Evilaxe
	Evilaxe: :)  I can't see any move that enables me to survive past this move. Thanks for the game, it's been fun.

39) Evilaxe: Attack G2S Evilaxe

40) MatrixFrog: Build R2 Matrixfrog
	Evilaxe: wow, I'm either missing something big, or I'm back in this game. (Probably the former)

41) Evilaxe: Sacrifice G2 Evilaxe
Build R3 Nohope
Build R3 Magrathea
	MatrixFrog: Well, I could have caused a catastrophe, but then I'd have no presence in your homeworld, although you'd still be alive... I thought this was slightly better... not so sure.

42) MatrixFrog: Discover R2 Matrixfrog B1 Bluey
	MatrixFrog: I'd like to think I'm slowly getting better at this game, but it's not necessarily true, it seems.
	Evilaxe: Sorry about this. It's late at night here and I can't seem to run all the scenarios through my head.  I'll move tomorrow morning/afternoon.
