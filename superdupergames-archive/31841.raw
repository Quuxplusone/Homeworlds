Homeworlds Online (SDG# 31841)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2017.4.1, Ended: 2017.6.3
Participants: wil (S), Laurie_Menke (W), Draw5PlayAll (N), Felix (E)
Winner: Draw5PlayAll

1) Draw5PlayAll: Homeworld B3 R1 G3

2) Felix: Homeworld R2 B1 G3
	Draw5PlayAll: All right, good luck -- not just in the usual sense but that this time the game gets played.
 
The teams appear to have worked out as such: Felix and wil are on one team, me and Laurie on the other. If either member of the team wins then it is a win for both.

3) wil: Homeworld Y2 B1 G3
	wil: Laurie and I
	wil: Not a change of teams...it is just that I never get to correct others English! (And am probably wrong anyway
	wil: But team strategy...interesting...

	wil: Current actual concern with teams...the setup looks like I am going to be south??  So ES plays two moves, the WN plays to moves?
	wil: Should make for lots of catastrophes...
	wil: My homeworld choice is dependent on who my partner is at this point...it looks like I should be with d5pA
	wil: I am playing just to ping the board...  If I am not felix's partner I'd like to change this move.
	wil: I am willing to play side by side if that is how it works...just to see if it will be as awful as I suspect.

4) Laurie_Menke: Homeworld Y3 B2 G3
	Draw5PlayAll: I believe I stated that we were doing 1+4 vs 2+3, to mitigate the first turn advantage.
	Draw5PlayAll: Therefore according to that rule wil is teamed up with Felix.
	Laurie_Menke: OK... so all that said, I'm going to go ahead and play.  But I do see wil's point.  It'll be interesting to see how this turns out!  Have fun, everyone!

5) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall

6) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: And really, 1+3 vs 2+4 has the same flaw... often 2 can do nothing to stop 1+3 from killing 4.
	Laurie_Menke: Yeah, I can see that, too.
	Felix: Yeah, this should be interesting...

7) wil: B G1 Wil

8) Laurie_Menke: Build G1 Laurie_menke
	wil: So...no table talk?  At all?  Or no table talk in private messages only within the game for all to see?
	Draw5PlayAll: Private messages are fine
	Laurie_Menke: Interesting...

9) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: I have received none so far.

10) Felix: Build G2 Felix

11) wil: T G1 B1 Wil
	wil: Team Strategy on fleek eh?

12) Laurie_Menke: Trade G1 B1 Laurie_menke

13) Draw5PlayAll: Trade G1 Y1 Draw5playall

14) Felix: Trade G1 B1 Felix

15) wil: B B2 Wil

16) Laurie_Menke: Build B2 Laurie_menke
	wil: So to declarify a loop hole in the rules...if my partner knocks me out... I win.
	Draw5PlayAll: No, you win by being the last survivor. So your partner has to knock both opponents, as well as you, out for your statement to work.
	Felix: @wil Hahaha, our team strategy is SO on fleek!
	wil: err...scuse me sir...d5pA... you made the rules..  
 
 "If either member of the team wins then it is a win for both."
	Draw5PlayAll: This is not a Sinister match... normally in a 4P game you win by being the LAST survivor... not just by killing 1 empire.

17) Draw5PlayAll: Trade G1 R1 Draw5playall
	wil: I gotcha...  I'm just a binary guy... I think I may have seen one entire game of four player.. jumped in due to the partner thang

	Laurie_Menke: Bye wil.  :(  Well done Draw5PlayAll!  :)
	Laurie_Menke: Interesting... wil's pieces weren't removed...

58) Laurie_Menke: Trade G1 R1 B2
	Draw5PlayAll: Laurie... I have an idea, please consider undoing that move and instead going to the G2 system
	Draw5PlayAll: If you do then I can send in MY green, and blow up Felix's only large.
	Laurie_Menke: OK, I undid just to have time to check with folks.  That's a great idea, Draw5PlayAll... sorry I didn't see it!  Felix and wil... would you rather I play my original move and take the game closer to its close, or would you rather have the challenge of our team playing its best option and seeing what happens next?
	Draw5PlayAll: I think they are a little biased... they want Felix not to lose like this!
	Laurie_Menke: Agreed, and he should win (or at least have a better chance at it) since I made a stupid mistake.  What I'm asking is whether they would prefer to keep the game going by having me undo, or continue the game as it is (and most likely, but not definitely, win).
	Laurie_Menke: Well, since neither have answered, I think I will leave the move as it was.  It was a bad mistake, and I apologize, Draw5PlayAll. But I don't feel right backing up on a multi-player game without the other players' consent.

62) Draw5PlayAll: Trade G2 R2 G2
	Laurie_Menke: Actually, I still think we're going to win this thing, Draw5PlayAll.  :)  Whatever you do, don't give up your G3 & G2.  They're going to be the keys to winning.
