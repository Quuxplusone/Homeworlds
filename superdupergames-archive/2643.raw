jeep: I'm nervous that I mis-calculated here... but we'll see, I guess.
TwoShort: I've been nervous the last dozen moves... it's kind of refreshing to have an obvious move this time.

38) TwoShort: Trade G2 R2 Yolanda
TwoShort: Well, I was worried you had me; but looking at things now, I think you miscalculated... unless I've miscalculated and you weren't planning what I think you were planning... :)
jeep: You did what I expected, now I need to remember my response. I remember thinking it was non-obvious. Too bad there isn't a notebook type feature on the si...? Hmm? There is? Wow, mayby I should use it.
TwoShort: Well, what I thought you might be planning was sacrificing your Y3 to move your G3 all the way to my homeworld now that I have no red. But I wouldn't recommend it.
jeep: Right, I do that and you simply build two larges in your homeworld. I can take two, but then you can get an R3 and destroy me... yeah, that wasn't what it was. What else might destroy you? ;)
TwoShort: If you do that and I build two larges, you could respond by turning your large red, and then you'd be free to sacrifice the r2 even if I got red, and I'd be doomed. So I wouldn't build the two larges.
jeep: Yeah, I know. ;) *sigh* I really do know that I make bad moves at midnight, but I still make them. I think this game is as good as over now. I'm still thinking about it, but I'm thinking I missed that you'd wind up with the Y2 instead of me after the attack.
