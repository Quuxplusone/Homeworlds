	TwoShort: You should have kept growing.  New players almost always over-value red.  I take a red star in my homeworld chiefly to give me more room to grow yellow & green.  I generally take a red ship only when it means I could use it to take a particularly critical piece within two turns or when it will prevent my opponent from doing so.  An r1 in your homeworld at this point I can just ignore.  
  If you'd grown a green & moved it out you could factory for the G3.  I can't factory green unless I get another, which would have been the last 2 and given you the 3 anyway.  I'd have had to take desperate measures to make sure you didn't get it either (by moving to a g3 star), which I'd have done, but forcing me to do unproductive things while you grow is good enough.
  Oh, and while I like giving strategy advice, if you'd rather I didn't jump in and tell you when I think you made a bad move, just tell me to shut up :)  

14) MaxL: Build G2 Maxl
	MaxL: The advice is much appreciated.

15) TwoShort: Discover G1 Twoshort Y2 Yolonda

	TwoShort: OK.  I just sometimes feel bad because when I see what I think you should obviously do, I don't want to tell you until you get it wrong :)

28) MaxL: Build G1 Jaune
	TwoShort: Generally I'd say never move backward; and indeed, I don't see what it's doing for you here.  Eventually you might like to leave a green alone at Jaune so you can sac and build it, but you're not ready for that yet (and I can disrupt it).

	TwoShort: Gotcha :)  So the other reason to wait before you take red is that you really want to get an r2; it's much better than an r1.
