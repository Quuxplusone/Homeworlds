23) Danner: Attack Y1S Danner
	Aristos: I thought the rule was no take backs. Otherwise all attacks would end in a circular loop. 
	Aristos: (well, any that take place in a contested system)
	Aristos: If we just keep attacking and swapping the same ship back and forth, how does this get resolved?
	Danner: I don't know of any such rules. But I think it should be declared a draw if nobody wants to break the loop.
	Aristos: There's no way to declare a draw.
	Aristos: In a very strange twist of fate, I find myself trying to find a better move than "attack G1 Danner" in order to help you so that we can move the game along. Here's the best I've come up with:
You: trade G3 R3 Danner
Me: build G1 Danner
You: Sacrifice R3, take all ships.
 
Leaves you with 4 ships in Danner and a fifth to my 2, though I have the only capital ship on the board and it's my turn. 
 
It isn't my optimal play... if you trade your G3 for R3, my better play is to sacrifice the G1 to build a Y1 in Behemoth so I can build bigger yellow ships, but I'm trying to come up with a pattern that leaves us both in an ok position to break the cycle.
 
Thoughts?
	Danner: Losing one's last big ship while the opponent still has one... is rather unfortunate.
However, I'm very curious about the official solution for situations like this. I'm glad you paged the admin.
	Aristos: The opinion on Boardgamegeek forums is that although take backs are legal, one player or the other is misreading their best play on the board, but I really don't see it in our case.

24) Aristos: Build Y2 Aristos
	Aristos: Ok. Let me try this. I think this works. Your move...
	Danner: I believe a situation is possible where whoever breaks the loop will eventually lose (assuming optimal play).

25) Danner: Discover Y1 Danner B3 Ocean
	Aristos: I believe that to be the case too... it certainly may be the case in what I just tried. We shall see. I've left the "Admin Call" turned on because I really would like to hear about that scenario.

	Aristos: Congrats. All moves lead to a pretty quick ending for me. I still want to know about the take backs earlier. Admin isn't responsive, unfortunately.
	Danner: Thanks! I'm curious about it too. Fortunately, the call is still in effect.
