Winner: zoltar

1) zoltar: Homeworld Y2 B1 G3
Jesse: Hello. Sorry to take so long responding to your challenge; I've been busy with Origins.

2) Jesse: Homeworld R1 B3 G3
zoltar: Greetings from Greenbelt, Milky Way! Hope Origins was a lot of fun. Did you get to play any Homeworlds there? I wish I could have gone.
Jesse: Origins was, indeed, a lot of fun. I didn't get to play as much Homeworlds as I would have liked, but the games I did play were excellent. I very nearly won the tournament, but I pushed too hard at a critical point and Andy turned the attack and wiped me out in a very intense final game.

3) zoltar: Build G1 Zoltar
Jesse: Okay, just testing.

Jesse: Nice record. I see you've even beat TwoShort once. From the commentary there, it sounds like you haven't been playing long, either. Is that right?

12) Jesse: Build G2 Republic
zoltar: Two weeks, and yes I caught TwoShort off guard, but now he's back to pounding me again. Still, it was my first win against an experienced player. Also, in one game against Andy Looney (over the table last week), I blew up one of his stars before I died -- another first for me. I'm a chess player, and my favorite game is shogi, which is like a cross between chess and homeworlds, as the pieces you capture you get to drop in again later on the board as your own. This is a really fun game and I'm trying to learn it quickly, so I can take on Andy!

Jesse: Excellent! I hope you rise in skill to where you can give us all a run for our money. It will be nice to have a bigger pool of strong players to engage. Climb on up the heap!
Jesse: I also like Shogi, though I have not had the opportunity to play with anyone who really knew what they were doing. I even made my own Shogi set with westernized icons, which I quite like.

15) zoltar: Trade G2 Y2 Grape
zoltar: Hey, so have I: I've developed a shogi set out of Looney Labs pyramids that uses exactly 4 stashes, plus another stash of some solid color for promotions. We should play shogi sometime, too!
zoltar: Do you know the easiest place to play shogi online? I haven't actually played a game in years, except when teaching people the game.
Jesse: Hmm, that's what I get for getting distracted and playing incautiously. I'll have to start thinking seriously now.
Jesse: No, I don't know of anyplace to play Shogi online.
zoltar: Yes, I learned about "the Factory" from TwoShort. I'll check online -- I think there are servers in Japan that are free for playing shogi. I'll let you know when I find out.

zoltar: Hey, I found a shogi site, after a long, tough internet search: there were several, but all in Japanese, so I had no idea how to sign up; finally I found a free one with an English option. I boldly chose a starting rating of 1500, and then got trounced by two 1200 rated players. Anyway, sign up and we'll play a game! the site is http://www.shogidojo.com/eng/engindex.htm
zoltar: Wow, those shogi players are all good. I'm now 0-6 and my rating has dropped from 1500 to 1358. Cool site. Didn't seen anyone else from the USA there either. I thought I was better, but I guess my shogi rating is somewhere near the bottom as I've yet to win a game -- maybe I haven't played in a while.

18) Jesse: Discover G2 Republic Y3 Johny
Jesse: Looking at the equivalency between rating points and kyu/dan ranks, 1500 would be pretty darn good. Their interface seems a little clunky to me, and they don't seem to have a real downloadable client, which is a drag for me on dial-up. And, of course, there's a reason I made my set with westernized icons. I have a great deal of difficulty distinguishing many of the pieces with the traditional markings.
zoltar: Well, I'm now at 1200, and have a record of 2-12! I seem to be able to have a good game with those around 1000, and get clobbered by anyone over 1200. You get used to the pieces really fast -- that's not so much a problem. Dial-up? That's sort of like having a phonograph instead of CD's isn't it? :) Do you have a picture of your set online? I'd like to see. In other news, I plan to take on Home-World Champion Andy Looney in person tonight...

19) zoltar: Trade G1 R1 Zoltar
zoltar: Well, if I know you are online, and you wait a minute for the client to load, we can try a game of shogi on the clunky site.
zoltar: My shogi rating has now dropped to 976 -- if I keep this up I will soon be in the negative numbers.

20) Jesse: Trade G2 R2 Republic
Jesse: I hope you don't mind if I take my time in this game. You've got me in rather a bad situation.
Jesse: I don't have any pictures of my Shogi set online, but I should. I'll take some.
