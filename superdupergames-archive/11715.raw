1) MadWuher: Homeworld Y1 B2 G3
	wmreed: Currently, my favorite Homeworld is a blue-green combo.  I think it's best because it allows me to build and change no matter what else happens.  I've lately been starting with a Y3 ship, to take advantage of an opponent's careless Bluebird mistake.  What are your thoughts on openings?
