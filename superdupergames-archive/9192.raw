mneme: it was actually a blunder -- but you forgot to actually -cause- the catastrophe that would have decimated my homeworld.

mneme: And...um...read the rules on sacrifices. they're important.

scottobear: that was my plan, to blow up the system.


19) mneme: Attack B1 Mneme
mneme: Yes. But to do that, you have to specify the catastrophe at the end of the move where you cause it. Otherwise, I can act to prevent the catastrophe, if possible

scottobear: I see... I just failed to activate it?
