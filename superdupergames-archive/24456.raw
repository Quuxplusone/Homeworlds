	SilentTitan: oh... a medal from the national boardgaiming convention for winning at the binary homeworlds tournament held there.
	wil: I just went back thru...I am playing a number of games and got confused...I did NOT beat him....he timed out on me and I was thinking of another game that ended about that time....but I did not beat him by play...
	wil: The goal, videos which teach the intracies of games of homeworlds. The concept, ask the main players of homeoworlds what they consider some memorable games, where they were eitther trounced by something they didn't see coming or outplayed, or played a very good game themselves against an admirable foe... And then the game will be recreated with a play by play analysis and commentary by the creator of the pyramids against the creator of the game Homeworlds..... You pick the game number (from the archive) and if you wish we give you credit for your half of the game.... If you'd like to participate, send me the game link, and a short paragraph indicating what makes that game memorable in your mind, and it will be submitted, (you can send more than one, for different reasons, (use of factory, bluebird, the transport, catastrophes, doomsday machine, domination by controlling one color/economy, etc) .... Care to submit?
