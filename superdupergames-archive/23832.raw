	wil: you lose the game by not having any of your own ships in your homeworld, or by losing the stars of your homeworld.  I will continue taking ships in this game....  (unless you have something up your sleeve I don't see!)  I would be happy to answer any questions on strategy (even though I am still learning!)  My method has been to lose... I think the more you lose the more you learn what works, what doesn't, and what attacks look like as they start to come at ya!


31) wil: Attack Y1 Pgadey
	pgadey: I think you are right, I have essentially lost. This has been an interesting game though. 
 
I think that this is the kind of game that takes  a lot of losses to understand.

32) pgadey: Attack B1 Pgadey
	wil: yes between catastrophes, attacks and sacrifices a lot of things can happen...this is a great thinking game...total strategy and skill and a lot can happen....keep playing.   (I look at the top player, I know he plays live games offline and has played over 200 games online and only lost 35)  So plan to lose a dozen games and I guarantee you will win a few prior to making that dozen losses!
	wil: Right now i just took over your yellow...so you can't move, now to delay you could change the color of one red to green  (otherwise I just build a green and cause a catastrophe)...but the end is near ..  just today I asked a guy if he was willing let me play rather than resign  so I could see what he was going to do with the advantage he has over me...I know he'll beat me in less than ten moves...but I wanna see how he'll do it to learn.
	wil: I just started playing and am now playing 8 games, monitoring the top games in the ladder challenge...to see what the good guys are doing...

33) wil: Build R2 Pgadey
Catastrophe Pgadey R
	pgadey: Wow! You are really into this one. I dig it! I would happily play some more rounds against you, to learn a bit more about this stuff. I have all the physical stuff to play at home, but never seem to get around to it.
 
How did you find out about this one?
	wil: It is tough to find folks willing to play...anyone into Chess or Shogi is more likely.... and if you play online it is to your advantage to set up the starfield at home and you can see it better as the representation here leaves a lot to be desired.
 
I just found it to be quite the intrigueing game, and with folks only moving every day or two, sometimes you can catch them online and get two or three moves a day....the games are spread out....  seeing all vaieties of attacks come at you though teaches you a lot  (that being said, I often make the same mistakes repeatedly...thinking one day I'll see them coming)
 
Challenge again, I'd b glad to play.

34) pgadey: Build B2 Pgadey
	wil: oops!!   game is still on..i didn't notice I didn't capture your blue before I catastrophed red...you get  reprieve and I have to rebuild everything to get back in again!!
	pgadey: Hehehe -- I see that trying to stick it out works sometimes. I was going to build a red then catastrophe to "go out with a bang" but decided to build a blue, pray you wouldn't capture it, then build a red and catastrophe. Turns out -- Everything worked out in my favour.
 
Round two!

35) wil: Build G1 Fortcourage
	wil: this is the amazing nature of the game...one can be dominating and a stupid mistake clears the board and makes a whole new game....now to capitalize on my error whilst I attempt to keep from making another @$@%&*##

	pgadey: Next move you'll sacrifice your red ship and cause me to have no ships in my homeworld.  That was a good long game. Thanks for playing. Wanna try again?
 

	wil: I just set my record and another's for long games....it took him 55 moves to kick my butt (I kept running in circles), but yeah, when I moved in I thought I had my count right...but was afeared I was missing something.   Always up for another game....trying to learn this thing!   thx...
