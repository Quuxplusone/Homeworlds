1) Babamots: Homeworld B3 R1 G3

3) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots

	Babamots: Let me know if you have any trouble with the controls. The commands for HW are easier to figure out than some other games on SDG, but there are a few quirks. I think you have to put each sacrifice action on a new line, for example.

	Babamots: Getting crushed by experienced players is the traditional way to get better at Homeworlds :-). I hope you feel you've gained some valuable experience.

This page loads super slowly, but it'll give you a list of SDG players in order of their Homeworlds score as well as how long it's been since they were on the site. If you'd like to pick an *active* opponent with a particular skill level, this is a good place to look.

	Babamots: I noticed that I was in "check" once after you moved your r2 closer to my home, here:
 
http://www.superdupergames.org/?page=archive_play&gid=36307&idx=53
 
I had always planned to trade my r3 for b3, but your move made it urgent.
	Babamots: GG! Thanks for the game!
	StormCrow: I came across your guide when browsing your profile after we started playing. Figures I picked an expert to play against for my first game.  Thanks again for the schooling, and for the links.
	StormCrow: And yes, that one point there was where I held the most hope for a mistake on your part.  Something that might get missed in a fast RL game that is easier to remember to look for when playing async
	Babamots: Yeah, when I lose IRL, it's usually to a missed catastrophe. I miss them on SDG too, but much less often.
	Babamots: We can play another match if you'd like, maybe a practice game with open discussion of plans and strategy advice?
	StormCrow: Sure, I'd enjoy that
