	mneme: I mostly just re-enalalyze each game as I get to it, since earlier inthe tournament I was in 4 games at a time much of the time.  But with shoejitsu playing fairly slowly, I've mostly been able to give you my full attention.
	mneme: I should make a study of small and tiny universe games at some point.  I never have, largely because my intuiton reads them as a loss for player 2.  But since P2 starts the game on the attack if they don't simply start at disadvantage--so there are probably some openings where it's the right approach.
	wil: Dang it...I'd rather only get half of your intention.
	wil: I am a shoot from the hip player...  I don't have the attention span to figure out everything.  Although playing various players I get to learn new moves from their analyzing.  I do notice if anyone can't see anyway out they tend to not want to make a move at all... a homeworlds metaphor.

40) wil: B R3 Wil
	mneme: I'm also pretty shoot from the hip, but I do build a vocabulary of principles and best practices.  One of the reasons I avoid small universe games is that they're unfamiliar to me.  The stakes for everything are higher and there's less room to safely develop, so it seems like any advantage or disadvantage or risk is going to be magnified.  I might be able to turn this to my advantage with practice, but I'd need some time and losses to get the practice.
 
I learned  -so- much from my first few TwoShort games.
	wil: Yeah Ive started playing more unconventional games...just to learn them.
