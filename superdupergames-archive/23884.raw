	wil: thx for the game...  the learning curve on this thing is awfully interesting....  ready for another when you are.

	ts52: D'oh. Should've seen that one coming. Well played. Always happy to play another.
	wil: You guys have been teaching me the pitfalls of having only one, even just two colors in your homeworld....yeah, I think you were blinded by your march forward blowing up stars with that red ship...funny thing is, i had two games were I was working toward the exact same thing....the other fellow just changed his homeworld to yellow on me...
