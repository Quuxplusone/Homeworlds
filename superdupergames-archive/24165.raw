Attack G1 Marmalade
	wil: I think I got outta the jam and into the marmalade
	wil: I'm still new to this game...  it took me 10 games just to learn the system halfway...the past 20 games I've been winning some and losing some...every loss teaches me something that I didn't see coming....  one rule...always keep a queen (3pip) in your homeworld (unless she goes out for the kill)

34) Marmalade: Trade G1 R1 Marmalade
	Marmalade: Yep, think I may have screwed up here.
 
I was trying to gain an advantage in size-three ships, and didn't see the trade for red/double-move, which may have been the only thing that could have saved me.

35) wil: Attack R1 Marmalade
	wil: It was a valid plan....another hint I've learned...anytime anyone trades for a yellow...especially a two or three pip....look at where they can move..they are usually getting set for an attack someplace...

	Marmalade: yeah, no way out of this one.
 
Cheers :)
	wil: diving into my homeworld with your triple blue would have extended the game and given me a chance to do something stupid...another thing I've learned....prolonging the game provides opportunities for openings when it appears all is lost as the dominator gets cocky....a reboot (catastrophe or two) changes the game quickly....  good game...love to play another when you are interested....this is definitely a game you learn by losing...
