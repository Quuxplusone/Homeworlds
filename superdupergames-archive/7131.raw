MikeYarrum: I'm not quite clear on the rules here - Can you now sacrifice your r3 to attack the ships in my homeworld?
mneme: no -- I'd need to have another ship in your system for that. but I can keep taking your ships until they're all gone, and there's pretty much no way out. (play it out, to see how it works, I think)

Move G1 Frigg Mneme
Move G2 Frigg Mneme
MikeYarrum: Ouch, that's right. I was hoping I could at least take out one of your stars before too long.
mneme: unless I'm miscalculating or you do something unexpected, I win next turn -- build, and I cause a catastrophe. anything else, and I sac the red and take your home system.
