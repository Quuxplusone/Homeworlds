	wil: Note... My opening...starting without a blue...is completely unorthodox.. But I have been successful with it...currently mixed reviews... And most popular opening is the banker, currently considered strongest and as a starship commander and galactic overlord, decorum does not allow me to use it against you...

27) Danielaurence: Discover G3 Jelloland B2 Topos

	Danielaurence: I love using unorthodox strategies in games like this. I didn't know that the banker is considered stronger. I really like learning how to use less popular strategies and openings in these games. Thank you for your grace in avoiding the banker, oh great galactic overlord. Please allow my humble construction/conversion fortress to exist in peace!

	wil: We will let you live in peace....and expect similar diplomacy on your side...you do have an excess of resources which we will gladly facilitate taking off your hands at some point in time, and should your ancestral lands ever become desrbalized we will assist by eliminating the star before it nebulizes and puts my galaxy at risk

	wil: Anytime...
	Danielaurence: Any tips regarding strategy? I'm still quite bad at this but I'd love any pointers from my new galactic dictator. You know... just in case I find a chance to spark a rebellion and overthrow your empire.
	wil: Try to keep up in color/economy...not to allow a monopoly...begin and stay with the ends in mind... Loss  lot, learn a lot...seeing various attacks come at you..
	Danielaurence: Thanks!
