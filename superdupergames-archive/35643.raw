	Draw5PlayAll: I think so.

2) bhorner: Homeworld B1 R2 G3

3) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall
	bhorner: I think according to the tournament set-up, you moved first so you should fill out the game start form.  I can probably do it if you'd rather not. :)

	bhorner: If I don't get a red now, I have to get a 2 of something before the red 2's are gone...
	bhorner: Well, that was supposed to go into the notes box, not the comments box.  :)

	bhorner: FYI, I will be out of contact for Nov 8th, 9th, and 10th.  I will try to figure out my move, and make it Friday morning.
 
If you could delay your move for a couple of days (but make sure you can still get back to 7), I would appreciate it!
	Draw5PlayAll: Your green trade looks suspicious.
	Draw5PlayAll: (build not trade)
	bhorner: I was in a bad spot, I felt.  Probably still am. That was all I could come up with.  :). Feel free to make some mistakes, I could use them!
	bhorner: Oh no, did you forget to move?  As long as the game doesn't end on the timer, I won't force it based on time, whatever happens.  I'm back in contact now and able to make moves.
	bhorner: Sorry if something is going on for you, I'm not sure what to do of I don't hear from you anymore.  I guess if your time runs out, if I haven't heard from you within 7 more days, I will end the game.  I'd rather not have it end that way though, so I hope you can get back in touch.
 
That would make the no-communication end time of the game 10pm Nov 19th.
	Draw5PlayAll: Augh! Yes, I did.
