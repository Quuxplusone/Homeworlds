	MadWuher: D'oh....... Didn't see that one coming so quickly.

46) TwoShort: Pass
Catastrophe Madwuher Green
	MadWuher: Oh well, C'est la vie.
 
Any way I could have gotten out of that mess?
	MadWuher: How many moves ago did you plan this/see this coming?
	TwoShort: Well, you shouldn't have let me get ahead on 3 points way back at the beginning.  But you were doing a remarkably good job holding me off after that until right after the red catastrophe.  I think I was expecting you to go after the big yellows at that point, but instead you let me take them.  At that point it was probably over; once I jumped into your systems with the y3s you could have done something desperate to preserve the r2 and live a bit longer, but it would have been ugly.
  Anyway, thanks for the game!

	MadWuher: Thanks for the game. I'll replay that game again with my pieces and see what I could do better for the next time we play. (After all, I have to beat you at least once, right?)
	TwoShort: I hadn't seen your "how many moves" question when I wrote that last message, so to answer that: I guess I thought through this sequence when I was considering the move that built the 3 yellow pieces.  But not really as what I expected to happen; rather as "If I do that, he could set up to take the g3, but if he does I can threaten Edora and his r2, and he'll have to sacrifice a yellow and run away with whatever he can, because if he leaves the r2 I can take it and threaten to pounce on his homeworld, or if he uses it I can pounce immediately."  So I guess that's 2 of my moves in advance, but it's not like I considered every other thing you could have done; I tend to just look for what the other guy could do that might make my move not worth it, and see if I can respond to that.
  In any case, I'm happy to play anytime...
