	mathochist: Alexcobo: no, sinister is offered as a variant. I had seen on the wiki that n the sinister version, killing another player other than your left-hand neighbor doesn't end the game.
 
Since it's offered as a variant but didn't show up in the offering or the title bar as such, I was pretty sure it wasn't that...  and I didn't see anything to indicate good or evil, so I didn't think it was that, either.  I just wasn't sure whether it might be something else I hadn't thought of.  Thanks!

	dethdukk: oh, good luck everyone.
