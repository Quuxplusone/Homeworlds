Homeworlds Online (SDG# 21350)
Started: 2011.12.14, Ended: 2012.1.18
Participants: quozl (S), Subhan64 (N)
Winner: Subhan64

1) Subhan64: Homeworld G1 B2 Y3

2) quozl: Homeworld G2 B3 Y3
	Subhan64: first thing is to establish your homeworld.  You want to include g & b, and either y or r.  without blue, you can't construct ships, and without b you can't trade them.  You probably want to pick either a 1/3 or a 2/3 star so you are 2 steps away from me, and definitely a size 3 ship

3) Subhan64: Build Y1 Subhan64
	quozl: Oh wait, I just finally figured out what you meant by 1/3 or 2/3. Since I made a 1/2, that means our stars are just 1 step from each other, right?

4) quozl: Build Y1 Quozl
	quozl: But I can undo my move and change it to a 2/3!
	Subhan64: yes that is right.  Now, your next move will be to construct a y1 ship in your homeworld.


5) Subhan64: Discover Y1 Subhan64 G3 Kermit

6) quozl: Discover Y1 Quozl R1 Fozzie
	quozl: ok
	Subhan64: so now you have choices about what you can do - if you build a y1, I'll get to build a y2.  You can trade your y1 or y3 for an equal-sized ship of a different color, or you can discover a new world
