andylooney: Dang, I wish I hadn't let you blow up my fleet of little yellows! When I put a 3rd ship in that system it was safe, but I got so interested in cashing in my investment that I didn't notice it was no longer safe to keep that fleet of 3 together! And now, with them gone, my plan for destroying you is ruined, and I find I've painted myself into a corner! Plus, I can't believe how far I've let you monopolize the green economy! You've got 2 factories, and I'm totally frozen out! Ack! I thought I was on the brink of victory, but now I think I'm going to lose this one! Oh well... :)
