	ajo: I think I know what you're planning. Very nice. I'm rarely able to plan far enough ahead in the early game to pull that off.

23) ajo: Sacrifice R1 Ajo

24) mneme: Move G3 Mneme Violet
	mneme: I'm curious what you're thinking.  I tend to be moving towards several things at once if I can manage it, though -- threatening catastrophes, green expansions that grab larges, freezes on whatever color my opponent is ignoring, etc.  
	ajo: Well, for a couple moves there you were threatening "sac g3; build y2y3y3". (I assume that's what you meant by "green expansions"?) I'm less worried about that possibility now, though.

25) ajo: Sacrifice Y1 Violet
Discover Y2 Violet B2 Beta
	mneme: That was certainly one of my plans.  I got the extra large without that, though, so it all works out.  

26) mneme: Sacrifice Y3 Mneme
Move G3 Violet Alpha
Move G3 Alpha Ajo
Move G1 Host Mneme

27) ajo: Sacrifice Y2 Beta
Move Y2 Alpha Ajo
Move G1 Alpha Ajo
	mneme: Of course, one of my plans was to let you get rid of all your red while I had a path to your home system...

28) mneme: Sacrifice R2 Mneme
Attack G3 Ajo
Attack G1 Ajo
	ajo: Oh dear. I didn't even notice that. This is going to be a short game!

	mneme: Yeah -- it's all over.
	ajo: Good game.
	mneme: Good game!
