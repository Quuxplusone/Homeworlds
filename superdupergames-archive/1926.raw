	xoet: ok so it says waiting for to move   now is it my turn cuase i cant play anything no command box or do i just resign ???  I could not log on for the past few days but i did try to with no luck not until now could i do anything
	MightyJack: We had a similar problem when someone was eliminated in another Sinister Homeworlds game that I'm currently playing in... looks like Aaron's help will be needed to fix this one too.
	Aaron: Well, on the positive side of things, this problem is a new problem.  The changes I made last week seem to actually have worked.  I am confused though.  The game history seems off.  I am going to undo the last move and see where we end up.  I am going to monitor the game.  Let me know what we need to do to salvage this.

	Uglyfoot: So do I go after the resigned Toni or sharpen the knives for Xoet?  Which one is my victory condition?  I would guess Xoet...
	MightyJack: Your new target is Xoet.  Toni's ships are still available for capture... but good luck getting a red ship to survive long enough in her system to do it.
	MightyJack: Actually, now I'm seeing that Toni has been "unresigned"... so you might not have a new target after all.  The rumors of her resignation may have been exaggerated... :-)
	Toni: I keep getting these messages that it's my turn, but there is no where to make a play. I did resign. I just catch on as to how to do anything. Sorry guys. :( Toni
	MightyJack: If you don't see a command window, do you see a Resign button that might let you quit again if that's your wish?
	MightyJack: Toni says she resigned and I don't see any indication that she wants to get back in on the game, so I'm going to press the "Force Resign" button and see what happens next...

36) Uglyfoot: Build Y3 Uglyfoot
	MightyJack: So far, so good.
