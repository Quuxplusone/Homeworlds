	endo: Although the tutorials tell you to get at least one of each, that's a gross oversimplification. The main reason it's bad to give your opponent control of some color is that then they'll be able to build medium/large ships in that color while you won't. For building those ships, however, they need room on a star with a ship of that color. Each star can usually house two ships of the same color (three in the early game or when there are no catastrophe threats, such as when you already control a color). The stars in the system reduce this value by one or two, depending on the situation.
 
In order to gain build capacity, you need to send your ships to new stars with a free "slot" as you build more. In here, you can't build green, because your green star takes away the slot.
 
You usually don't need to rush into all the colors, you just need to make sure you don't get frozen out of anything. In this case, I was only building green ships, so I wasn't threatening to take all the small ships of some other color.
 
What you do need to take care about is that your opponent doesn't get bigger *sizes* of ships than you. Bigger ships get produced once the smaller ones run out (this is why you need a lot of build capacity in a color you are trying to control, to "push" the color to the bigger sizes). When you get to the medium ships, it's much easier to obtain any color when necessary, because the medium ships are exhausted only after the small ones. And, size is power, obviously.
 
To get to the larger ships, you can either use the same color as your opponent (build capacity less important, since either player can store the small ships) or start a "race" with a different color (build capacity very important). If your opponent has controlled a color, having one small of each other color won't get you towards medium and large ships.
