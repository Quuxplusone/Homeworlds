	jeep: You still with us?
	jeep: I want to start another game, but it would be too much if this comes back to life too.  Looking at your history, it appears you don't finish games once you fall behind.  Sorry.
	lambda: Sorry about that. I got busy, got behind on SDG, and just stopped playing entirely. I hope to be better about keeping up with SDG this time around.
