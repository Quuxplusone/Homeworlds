24) disaac: Pass

	disaac: It shouldn't... it is part of your turn though...

25) Onii77: Pass
Catastrophe Profit Red
	disaac: I have passed back to you so you can trigger the catastrophe. There is an implementation request about this in the sdg-wiki page to not allow catastrophes to force an explicit pass from the player causing it.
	Onii77: Next game we'll play the right way. :)
	disaac: Play 
On your turn, do one of these three things: perform a single free action in a system that you occupy, sacrifice one of your ships to take a certain number of actions of that ship's color, or take no action at all. After you do one of these three things, you **may** trigger catastrophes for any overpopulations that exist.
	disaac: I believe that the issue is that when you made your move, you should have included a carriage-return followed by a command to trigger the catastrophe
	disaac: pass
