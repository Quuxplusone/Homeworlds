Homeworlds Online (SDG# 35718)
Started: 2019.11.17, Ended: 2019.12.1
Participants: Babamots (S), Simon (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) Simon: Homeworld Y1 G3 B3
	Simon: Hi! This is for the Great Homeworlds Tournament 2019. Enjoy!
	Simon: Since you won 9 games in a row, I'll consider the opening carefully. Green starting queen is accepted theory. I've grown lots of experience recently with blue starting queens, but wonder whether it's too risky.
	Babamots: Well, you have a perfect record against me so far: 1-0 (I was a rung you stepped on in the ladder). I'm pretty worried about this match.
	Babamots: Will you fill out the form for the tournament?
 
I like to start with a g3 ship since it sets me up to get a factory later, but sometimes not enough green pieces get used and there's never a chance for a factory. A b3 start is usually fine too. I experimented with y3 openings for a while but didn't reach any firm conclusions.

2) Babamots: Homeworld B2 R1 G3
	Simon: Tourney form is filled, yep!
	Simon:

16) Babamots: Discover Y1 Babamots G3 Cardassia
	Babamots: Just realized that our home stars have no colors in common. I'm not sure I've ever seen that before.

	Simon: Opposite homeworlds has only become common from the green star, it's really rare otherwise, yeah.

23) Simon: Build R2 G2

24) Babamots: Move Y3 Bolarus G2

25) Simon: Build R3 Simon
	Babamots: I'm afraid I don't understand your last message. Do you mean players usually pick the same two colors in their home stars unless one of them chooses green?

26) Babamots: Sacrifice R2 Babamots
Attack R1 G2
Attack R2 G2
	Simon: I mean that, for opposite homeworlds to happen, one home star must be green. But mutual g3 starting ships are so extremely common that green home stars are rare.

27) Simon: Sacrifice B1 G2
Trade R3 G3 Simon
	Simon: The exception is the blue freezeout by second player (h gX b1 b3) to counter first player's small blue star. I haven't seen that with green yet, but theoretically it must exist with green, too.
	Simon: Finally, someone must want no blue star. This is also rare; the b3 ship is inferior until it becomes g3/y3 later.

28) Babamots: Trade Y2 G2 Babamots

45) Simon: Move Y2 G2a Iconia
	Simon: Very hard to calculate. The greedier move would have been to build b1, then sac b1 to trade r2 y2 @g2a, but that seems too slow.

46) Babamots: Sacrifice Y2 Babamots
Move Y3 G2 Simon
Discover G1 Iconia Y2 Gravesworld
	Babamots: I've been thinking about the position almost constantly since yesterday. Sacrificing your b3 for yellow didn't cross my mind until a few minutes before you moved. I think it was the right thing to do. If anything is going to ruin my yellow-hogging, that's it.

47) Simon: Attack Y3 Simon
