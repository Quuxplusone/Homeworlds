25) scottobear: Build Y1 Monkey
mneme: If you want to see how the endgame works, just keep playing -- I'm killing you in 3 moves no matter what you do, so there's not that much reason to short circuit it if you want to see the endgame. (hmm. Crazy play on your part can push it to 4 rounds; I don't see it going past that).

scottobear: thanks! I appreciate the strategy assist!

26) mneme: Move G3 Mneme Scottobear

27) scottobear: Move G1 Monkey Scottobear
mneme: I could fairly easily kill you with red...swap blue for red in daffodil, then move from mneme to your home system, then sac red to take 2 pieces from your home system. But you could delay it -- grow a red in your home system, move stuff back to keep going, etc. This way...I move to your home system, next turn I grow a green...after that, there's no hope; no matter what you do, I catastrophe your home system on t3; no more star = game over.
mneme: normally, moving my g3 out of my home system would be foolish. But in this case, with your only controlling smalls, it's quite safe.

28) mneme: Build G1 Scottobear
Catastrophe Scottobear G
mneme: Well, that makes it faster...thanks for the game!
mneme: Oh, FWIW, the "crazy play that can push it to four rounds" was, on move 25, "m r1 scottobear mneme". This threatened either a stalemate or a win if I didn't deal with it -- so instead of a three move win (was 2, but only because you helped by moving a g in), I'd have to spend 1 round capturing the red, (then you only had one ship in your home system, so you couldn't repeat the trick), one moving the g into your home system, and then either swap b for r and take both ships (a sure win only if you had only two ships in your home system and no drones) or grow twice to win by catastrophe.
