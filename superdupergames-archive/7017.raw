1) Keith: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3
	Keith: When I last met you I was but the learner. Now I am ...?
 
Hello TwoShort.  Don't count this game as part of your ZPIP challenge.  I had already decided not to enter that fray because, while it would be a nice trophy, others are more likely to get to play a face to face game with the pocket set.   

2) TwoShort: Homeworld B1 G3 B3 *
	TwoShort: If you don't want to count it, that's no problem.  I've been enjoying my ZPIPs even thought I can count the in-person opponents I've had on my thumbs.  It's that much less space to clear on my notoriously messy desk when I want to set up a tricky position.

3) Keith: Build G1 Keith
	Keith: Good point about using the ZPIP to set up tricky problems.  I use a virtual piece set in Illustrator for the same purpose.

4) TwoShort: Build B1 Twoshort

5) Keith: Build G1 Keith

6) TwoShort: Trade B3 Y3 Twoshort

7) Keith: Discover G1 Keith Y3 Amazons
	Keith: I am interested in seeing how your Homeworld startng setup works out.  I had actually typed in the command window for a y1 b2 g3 start when I remembered your chat in your game with jeep and changed it so I had a b1.

13) Keith: Discover G1 Amazons G2 Fanorona
	Keith: I am going to continue on my risky course.  I was interested in seeing how your blue ploy went because I had two games (one against Zoltar) where going for blue worked out in my favor.  Tried it in a third game against a relatively new player and it all fell apart.
 
At this point I find your blue efforts quite threatening.  I am going to continue on my course.  Can't tell if it will make for an interesting game or a very short one in your favor.

	Keith: Sigh.  I should have gone with move g3 Amazons Grogar.  If you attacked it I send in another green and destroy the system.  Otherwise I could have attacked ships.  Grabbing that g2 with the idea of not having to lose a g3 just put your blue strategy in high gear.

	Keith: Wow, talk about brain lock.  I never considered your applying your sacrificed R3 to more than one sector.  I think your move will turn out to be the decisive move of the game.
