1) nycavri: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3
	nycavri: Hello again.  You can tell a good game when you want to play again even after being thrashed 3 games in a row.....

2) zoltar: Homeworld G3 B1 B3 *
	nycavri: One game at a time, I think.  *grin*

3) nycavri: Build G1 Nycavri

4) zoltar: Build B1 Zoltar
	zoltar: Ah, I think you accepted my generic challenge while I was issuing a personal one.  Ok, I'll just create another generic one for other players again.  Meanwhile, going to try a 'trick' opening that a better player just pulled on me for the first time, which is this one, where you start with two blues and a green, the idea being to try to get into 2-sized ships first by using up all the b1's.  I don't know if it works, but I didn't make the best moves and got behind early.

5) nycavri: Build G1 Nycavri

6) zoltar: Trade B3 Y3 Zoltar
	nycavri: And you threw me with your Red opening last game.  I'm trying to go by the book for now - builder opening with a G3.

7) nycavri: Trade G1 Y1 Nycavri

8) zoltar: Build B2 Zoltar

9) nycavri: Build Y1 Nycavri

10) zoltar: Discover B2 Zoltar G2 Greendale
	zoltar: Yes, the red stars are more tricky, and are difficult in the opening, as red comes into play only in the later stages of the game (as you just saw), so that you have a slower start with a red star because it's the least used in the opening.
 
The strongest, safest opening is the one you have now, with yellow, blue, and green, and the small and medium stars, and this is called "the banker" because you can put green ships on 3-sized stars, and then when the color of the star is gone, you can sack your green, destroying the star, then build the 3-sized color that was the star, thus cashing in your 'investment'.  If you play the blue as small star and yellow as medium as you did, it allows this new trick response, which I just saw for the first time and am trying now.  If my trick is successful, then maybe a yellow small star and blue medium star would prevent any tricks.  We'll have to see.  I know very little about openings, and am learning them as I go.

11) nycavri: Build G1 Nycavri

12) zoltar: Build B2 Greendale
	nycavri: Yup - I meant banker, not builder.   Concentrating hard of the stash right now, but you're off to a flyer this time.

	nycavri: Have to biuld or I lose this turn.  If I build blue you blow up half my world.  So I build a green, which just delays the inevitable by a turn.  Did I miss anything?

51) nycavri: Pass
	zoltar: No, it's mate in two no matter what at this point.
	nycavri: I lost this one very early - when I did nothing to prevent your Bankrobber.  Have to look at that offline to see if there's a defense.
