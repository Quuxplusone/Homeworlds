8) MikeYarrum: Discover Y1 Mikeyarrum B3 Asagi
MikeYarrum: I was wondering what your next move would be.

9) zoltar: Build G2 Zoltar

10) MikeYarrum: Build Y1 Mikeyarrum

11) zoltar: Build Y2 Zoltar
zoltar: I think trading the large G3 for a Y3 was a 'forced' move, as I needed yellow, and trading a small gives you 2-pip yellows a move earlier.

12) MikeYarrum: Discover Y1 Mikeyarrum G3 Fuuka
MikeYarrum: My problem is, I should've snatched up a green 1-pip earlier. Now you can shut me out of them for good.

13) zoltar: Discover Y2 Zoltar B2 Plorrgh

14) MikeYarrum: Build Y2 Fuuka
zoltar: One of the reasons I've been using the red-blue star system is that if you had red-blue now you could easily trade a Y3 for a G3; but now if you do so, as soon as you build another green I send a green in and blow it up; the red-blue allows you to build both green and yellow without having to have 3 of a color in your system.
MikeYarrum: Ah, that's very true.

15) zoltar: Sacrifice G2 Zoltar
Build Y2 Zoltar
Build Y3 Plorrgh

18) MikeYarrum: Discover Y2 Fuuka B2 Ena
zoltar: Btw, you'd better go for broke now and fire off all your guesses in the Zendo game, because I doubt you'll get another turn...
MikeYarrum: Dude, if I had ANY idea of what to guess, I'd have done it a long time ago. The reason I asked to be kicked out is because I seriously have no clue whatsoever of any kind of rule that would be accepted. Everytime I think I've got a pattern, one of the koans busts it.

MikeYarrum: I appreciate your belief in me, but... man, stuff's hard.

19) zoltar: Move G1 Zoltar Plorrgh
zoltar: Well, then sit back in awe and watch Ryan do what Gort did in the last game and then ask him how he did it. Can't give you any hints as that would be cheating, but look how ryan's last koan was so close to several others and revealed a lot of information -- more than enough for you to win with 3 stones (or with one stone if you are Ryan or Gort). Just try to formulate any rule at all that works on all the koans, and then when I give a counterexample, use that as a clue, and so forth. Of course as you say, you have to have some hunch to get the ball initially rolling when you have 3 guesses to burn. Well, good luck.
zoltar: Btw, I really love my rules -- I think I'm coming up with great rules that are easy to formulate (six English words or so) but very hard to crack, but not too hard so that Ryan or Gort still get them easily whilst everyone else is stumped. If you are still stumped and Ryan gets it easily, besides illustrating how amazing Ryan is (I'm actually not much better than you, but I come up with better koans to test things than you do), it will show that I'm making really good rules.

20) MikeYarrum: Trade Y2 G2 Ena

21) zoltar: Build G2 Plorrgh

MikeYarrum: Sorry, I just didn't have any moves I liked.
