	Babamots: Out of curiosity, are you spreading your ships out because of the advice on my little website? One of my tips is to spread out your fleet when you have a large-ship disadvantage.
	Babamots: I think you're capable of coming up with this on your own, but I wondered if my guide has helped you or anyone.
	eliscinsky: While I have read most of your site, honestly I don't remember that piece of advice. So, no that is not what I was thinking.  I have another strategy that I'm trying. Hope you don't mind if I don't share it just now. I'll tell you afterwards. 
 
As an aside I didn't know you had moved when I went to bed shortly before midnight,  and I woke up around 3:45 thinking about it. At 4:30 I decided to just get up and study it. Your last move is not one I had considered yet. 
 
I think we've gotten to the point where we will move a bit slower. A falling of mine that I'm trying to work on. 
	eliscinsky: Wow, I must have still been a little sleepy. Meant to say ...
 
... and I woke up at 3:45 thinking about the game. (not your move)
 
... 
at 4:30 decided to get up and study [it] ... (the game).
