	bhorner: Don't forget to make your 2nd move!  :)
	bhorner: I guess I'll wait the recommended extra 7 days, but probably then "Force Surrender".  It seems like you've likely dropped out of the tournament though.
 
I hope everything is alright with you!
	Laurie_Menke: ::sigh:: I'm sorry for the big delay, bhorner. I was on a cruise and then at a convention and thought I could still keep up, but failed miserably. I have not dropped out, and will do better now! Thanks for your patience!

	bhorner: Hm, it took away my indentation...  The sacrifices separate the three moves I planned.
	Laurie_Menke: I'm not sure which b3 you would attack in the plan below, but I agree that I was just about dead. I'm sorry I didn't give you the chance to finish me off. I know disappearing like that was very poor form, and I apologize. Work plus COVID plus getting pneumonia just really knocked me for a loop the last couple of months.  ::sigh:: I am very sorry.  CONGRATULATIONS on the win!  :)
	bhorner: I'm not worried about anything.  Challenge me any time.  :)
	Laurie_Menke: <3
