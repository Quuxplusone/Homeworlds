	Gungho: Thanks for the game. I was happy to see you get the yellow catastrophe. Next time maybe keep a big ship at your hw.  And also remember the "gun rule".  If your opponent draws his gun (red ship) it's almost always a good idea to draw your own.
 
Sorry I'm not a great teacher, but feel free to send me a challenge any time (rated or not)
	Sarthobi: Thanks a lot, i didnt think about you using the sacrifice on the red ship a head of time, thought i'd get to destroy the second star before you catch all my ships :]
