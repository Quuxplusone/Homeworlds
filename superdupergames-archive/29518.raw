Winner: orangeblood

1) orangeblood: Homeworld Y3 B2 G3

2) Felix: H G3 B2 Y3
	orangeblood: Hi... first game, no idea what I'm doing! But I've heard a lot about it, and looking forward to learning.
	Felix: Hey there! Welcome! I'm glad you decided to jump in. It's and extremely fun game. I'd be happy to help you learn the ropes. I don't think I'm as scary as some of the other players on here, who are insanely good!

3) orangeblood: Build G1 Orangeblood
	Felix: Let me know if you have any questions, and if I think of any tips along the way, I'll give em! Most importantly, have fun

4) Felix: B Y1 Felix
	orangeblood: Thanks for offer to help! First question: Why did you choose to build a a star system the same size as mine. Everything I've read indicates it's better not to... but I'm guessing the answer is that a more experienced player can take advantage of that. :)
	Felix: You know what? I actually didn't notice I built the same size until now! The fortress setup, which is what we both have, is usually considered weaker, and I usually pick it when playing against a new player. I didn't look closely enough at your setup and just made a mistake :) I actually did intend them to be different. This will make for a much faster and more close range game!
	Felix: Your choice of starting colors is really smart. I normally don't put green as one of my starting homeworld colors. A yellow/blue star with a green ship is the most effective from my experience. It all comes down to personal preference though!

5) orangeblood: Trade G1 B1 Orangeblood

6) Felix: T Y1 B1 Felix
	orangeblood: I notice you trade for a blue ship early... why don't you start with a blue ship? Because you want to keep a large yellow at home?
	orangeblood: (BTW, do you know about the Pyramid Arcade Kickstarter currently underway?)
	Felix: Usually I start with a large green, actually. It's one of the most useful colors to have a large early on because you can sacrifice it any time for three builds, and it can also allow you to set up a "factory" situation. I tend to trade for blue early on because it's usually one of the more contested colors in the game for some reason so it's good to try to get some of it early, especially if your opponent is also going for it.
	Felix: If there are only two small a of a particular color on the second turn, you usually want to trade your first small ship for that color to make sure you don't get locked out of it.
	Felix: And yes! I backed it! Looks awesome :)

7) orangeblood: Build G1 Orangeblood

8) Felix: Build Y1 Felix
	orangeblood: The rules seem pretty easy to grasp... but i wont have much of a clue what to do until I've played a couple times. 
	orangeblood: I backed the Kickstarter also... even though I've not played any of the pyramid games. 

9) orangeblood: Trade G1 Y1 Orangeblood
	Felix: Yeah, this is one of those games where the basic rules are pretty simple, and the short-term strategy isn't too hard, but developing longer term strategies takes quite a few games to understand!
 
I think you will find the pyramid arcade well worth your money. it includes so many games, and the ability to play many more!

10) Felix: Trade Y1 G1 Felix
	orangeblood: I've sort of been frozen for a couple of days trying to figure out what to do, so I've decided to just do some things and not worry about making mistakes in this first game. :)
	Felix: Yeah, don't worry about it! You will make a lot of mistakes in your first few games. I still make mistakes, and I've played 70 games now!
	Felix: Just do what seems best, and you will learn as you go when you see the consequences of your moves :) 

11) orangeblood: Discover B1 Orangeblood G1 Bevo
	Felix: Trading for a yellow was a pretty good idea. I'd recommend sending your yellow or blue ship out to a new planet soon. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that if you only have one of a color in a system, then moving that color to a new system will immediately lose you the ability to build that color in the old system. So if you move out your blue now, for instance, you will no longer be able to build blue in your homeworld. That isn't necessarily always a bad thing, especially since you have blue as one of your home stars, so you don't really want to build much blue there anyway and risk a catastrophe. But it's just a good tip to remember that if you build a second ship of a color first and THEN move a ship to discover new lands, you will have the ability to build that color in both systems.

12) Felix: Discover G1 Felix B1 Opus
	orangeblood: Thanks for all the great tips!

13) orangeblood: Trade B1 R1 Bevo

14) Felix: Build G1 Opus
	orangeblood: Red hits the table! ;)
	Felix: Oh snap! It's getting real now!

15) orangeblood: Build G2 Orangeblood

16) Felix: Trade G1 R1 Opus
	Felix: It may have been an error on my part to allow you to build the first medium green like that. I didn't really have too much of a choice though. Nice job taking advantage of it!

17) orangeblood: Move Y1 Orangeblood Bevo

18) Felix: Build Y1 Felix

19) orangeblood: Move R1 Bevo Felix
	orangeblood: Do you know why when I try move to Felix, it tells me the system does not exist?

20) Felix: Sacrifice R1 Opus
Attack R1 Felix
	orangeblood: Ah, I wasn't writing my own system first. 

21) orangeblood: Build Y1 Bevo
	Felix: Glad you figured it out! And here's a painful lesson to learn. It's possible to sacrifice a red in one system and attack a ship in a different system. That's how I was able to take over your small red just now, giving me the only red at this point. You should always look out for that possibility! But I don't think it has set you back too much.
	orangeblood: Ah! Good thing to know. Now that you say it it makes sense. 

22) Felix: Move Y1 Felix Opus

23) orangeblood: Build Y2 Bevo

24) Felix: Build Y2 Opus

25) orangeblood: Move Y2 Bevo Orangeblood

26) Felix: Trade Y2 B2 Opus
	orangeblood: I assume if you sacrifice to construct in another system... you must still have a ship in the system you're building in of the same color you want to construct?
	Felix: Yep. You are correct. You still have to have a ship in the target system of that color. This is crucial when you try to set up a "factory." You need to have a large green on your home system, plus another green. Then, when there are no greens left, or only larges left, you can sacrifice the large green, then immediately rebuild it in the same system, and you can also use two other build actions. It is difficult to set up but can be very effective when used properly.

27) orangeblood: Trade Y2 R2 Orangeblood

28) Felix: Build G1 Opus

29) orangeblood: Trade G3 B3 Orangeblood

30) Felix: Build Y2 Opus

31) orangeblood: Build G2 Orangeblood

32) Felix: Discover B1 Felix R1 Echo

33) orangeblood: M G2 Orangeblood Bevo

34) Felix: S Y2 Opus
M B2 Opus Orangeblood
M B1 Echo Orangeblood
C Orangeblood Blue

35) orangeblood: Move R2 Orangeblood Opus
	orangeblood: Other than avoiding a catastrophe, what are the advantages of finding a second system like you did? (Unless that gives away what you're going to do, haha.)
	Felix: I don't mind giving away my plan at the moment :) the main benefit is just spreading your ships out so you can avoid a catastrophe and build more ships. It really limits how large your fleet can grow if you don't spread them out. In this case, however, I wanted to have two blue ships that are each one jump away from your system. It would have been too risky to put both blue ships in a blue system because you could have easily caused a catastrophe there and blown up the whole system
	orangeblood: I think I know what your next move is. I'll tell you why if it turns out I'm right. :)

36) Felix: B G2 Opus
	Felix: Were you right? :)

37) orangeblood: Attack G2 Opus
	orangeblood: Yes, and theres a funny story behind it. I saw youd answered my question, and just glanced over it without really absorbing what you said. Later I was checking out a video Andy Looney did about the Bluebird Mistake."
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/video/7488/homeworlds/strategy-lesson-and-bluebird-mistake
 
Which is pretty much what you did  sacrifice a ship to overload a color in the opponents home system. Then I went back and read your note more closely, and OF COURSE if you wanted to get two blue ships one jump away from my system, I figured thats what you had in mind. :)
 
Now I get to learn how hard it is to play with one star in my system and to have no blue!
	Felix: Good catch! I made the bluebird mistake myself several times. The best way to learn is to experience it for yourself! Making mistakes is the best way to learn from them so I hope this is helping your improve your game :) it is also challenging to not have a large ship, so you have quite an uphill battle in front of you!

38) Felix: Sacrifice Y3 Felix
Move G1 Opus Orangeblood
Move G1 Opus Orangeblood
Move Y1 Opus Felix
	Felix: Here's another situation where the blue bird mistake is possible. Can you catch it and prevent it?

40) Felix: Build Y2 Felix
	Felix: Yep, that will help. Good move!

41) orangeblood: Sacrifice G2 Bevo
Build G2 Opus
Build G3 Opus
	Felix: And another good move. You repelled my attack very nicely, and I may be in trouble now!

42) Felix: Move Y2 Felix Opus

43) orangeblood: Trade G3 R3 Opus

44) Felix: Discover Y2 Opus Y2 Hope

45) orangeblood: S Y1 Bevo

48) Felix: Build R1 Felix

49) orangeblood: Move Y1 Bevo Felix
Catastrophe Felix Red
	orangeblood: Man, you've expertly guided me through a dozen learning processes this game. I have to stare at the screen for an hour figuring things out. :)
	Felix: I'm glad you're learning! I actually made quite a mistake myself in this game, and I think I'm about to lose. I hope it has taught you some things though! Would you be up for a rematch?

	Felix: There's two different ways you could finish me off right now. Do you see both?
	orangeblood: I only saw the catastrophe... 
	orangeblood: Absolutely we'll do a rematch!

	Felix: The catastrophe was by far the more obvious, but you could also have sacrificed your R3 ship in my system and used your three attack actions to take over all three of my small reds with your small yellow. :) Rematch sounds good! If you want, you can just go accept my open challenge on the challenge list
	Felix: And nicely done! You played well.
	orangeblood: Ah, yes. I had actually tried sacrificing the R3 before I had the yellow ship in there, but of course you can't sacrifice first if you have no other ship in the system. 
 
I'll start our new game later on tonight... thanks very much again for all your help!
	orangeblood: And by the way, what mistake did you make other than taking it easy on a newbie?
	Felix: No problem! I'm looking forward to our next game.
