	wil: nice choice!
	Simon: Is there a ko rule on SDG? The wiki didn't mention anything. What's the designer's official stance on ko?
	Simon: > nice choice!
thanks :) it's gonna be very expensive defense though

23) Simon: Build Y3 Simon
	wil: ko?
	Simon: I mean a rule to prevent repetition. (taking the same ship using red back and forth, with neither player wanting to break the cycle.)

24) wil: Trade R3 Y3 Wil
	wil: ah....that hasn't happened to me yet in 200 games...  but I sure blew this game

	Simon: > that hasn't happened to me yet in 200 games
okay, thanks. I thought it would come up more often. :)
> but I sure blew this game
Now as you say it, I see how I missed the one-move win (sac Y3, move R3 to wil)... I'd rather not undo, because I didn't see it. I don't see a forced win for me right now :)

	Simon: Thanks, I believe it was the only variation that was guarantueed to work in 2 turns. Now I don't know whether I lucked out in the middlegame, or if 'newb' doesn't match -- in any case, I learned new things, and have offer a rematch. :-)
