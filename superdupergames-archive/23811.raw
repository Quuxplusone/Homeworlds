	wil: these reboots are interesting..... it is like a whole new game has developed as the star systems get rearranged    I'd like to discuss openings and options and play....would you be interested?  If interested, would the best place to be on the forum, or maybe a google doc?
	SilentTitan: I would be interested in discussing all that. I don't know where the best place to do that would be.  I have access to several teamspeak servers and/or can give you a cell number if you'd like to call me.  I don't know where your comfort zone lies in contacting someone.  

58) wil: Build G1 Dryden

59) SilentTitan: Attack Y2 Sole South
	wil: my cell is 410/365-6699 but I think I need to see things to figure them out....and would lose a lot in conversation...

60) wil: Build G3 Wil

next turn build g3 wil 

62) wil: Sacrifice Y2 Fortcourage
Discover G2 Fortcourage B3 Carson
Discover B1 Fortcourage G3 Bedrock
	wil: ok, but I thought you'd sac your homeworld Y3 to move r3 into mine??
	SilentTitan: ah... I am really glad you saw that ... however the problem with doing that was that you would be able to sac the y2 in fortcourage and send back both the g2 and b2 or better yet send the g2 to wil and the y2 in sole into silenttitan ... now it becomes a race to who can capture faster. I might have won that one... but send both g2 and b1 in fortcourage back to wil and I have a big issue trying to caputre everyone. additionally you start trading ships to red and my remaining battleship is threatened.  
	SilentTitan: meanwhile my homeworld is left completely undefended ... which is ok... if I know I can win in a turn or two ... but three or four turns out .. that's not turned out well for me in the past

	SilentTitan: hummm... I'm not doing the best job of explaining this .... I sack y3 and move r3 to wil. then you sack y2 in fortcourage and send g2, b1 back to wil.  Now I attack and grab one of the 2-pip. you attack and take it back. what then attack again and take it back, convention says I cannot do that. otherwise the game becomes a draw at that point. so I instead sac the g1 in silenttitan and build a r1 .. that doesn't help ..you just use the b1 to change one of the 2-pips to red and catastophe red. hurts you .. but hurts me more ... I have no 2-pip ships. 

63) SilentTitan: Sacrifice Y1 Sole
Move R3 Fortcourage Carson
	SilentTitan: so instead I'm going to go the slow route and cost you as many ships as I can until you build the G3 and/or some red for defense. 

64) wil: Sacrifice G2 Carson
Build B1 Bedrock
Build B2 Bedrock
	wil: these are the kind of alternatives that would be handy...  a book would require some kind of overlay to watch it happen...  quite interesting scenarios...thanx

	wil: Sorry to drive you so crazy when I should resign, I am just seeing to what trouble one can put one through...how am I doing?

	SilentTitan: you are doing well.. One of the very main points of the game is... "The person who wins is the one who makes the fewest mistakes"  Therefore, it is always in ones best interest to hang in as long as possible you never know when the other guy will make a mistake. I told you I won into 2 place by using a trick in the last turn of the game and the other guy fell for it.

	wil: ah, I see, I somehow didn't read the second one...makes sense....I had nowhere to turn then, capturing would have allowed you to move one in, which I saw, but didn't se this.  I love learning, now if I can only remember!
	wil: ah, I see, I somehow didn't read the second one...makes sense....I had nowhere to turn then, capturing would have allowed you to move one in, which I saw, but didn't se this.  I love learning, now if I can only remember!
	wil: can't build a three, and get it home, you sac y2 and swoop in, thx forthe lesson!
	SilentTitan: You do better with each game we play ... so obviously you are remembering parts of it... tying it all together is something I'm still working on.  This game is deceptively difficult... it seems straight forward but there are hiccups in the thinking at various points. Also notice this one went over 40 turns.  very seldom does that happen except where both players are committed to running it down to the end to see what happens.  Either way we were 20+ maybe even 30+ when you decided to see what would happen.  Anything over 20 means you are getting better at playing ... anything over 30 means you're a danger to everyone on the ladder. 
	wil: Danger, Danger Wil Robinson....   It is quite the game and I look forward to learning more and absolutely appreciate your assistance to date.
