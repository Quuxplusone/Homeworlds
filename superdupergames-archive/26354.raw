	wil: awe the early attack...makes sense..  almost grew a red...
	TeeTeeTee: I sort of hoped you would grow a red: I'd have got a red monopoly in a few turns if you'd done that.

	TeeTeeTee: Hah! Well done.
	wil: not quite well done...you made the best response...  I sure was hopin you'd miss it!!

39) TeeTeeTee: Build G1 Mercia

40) wil: Move G1 Wil Gee2
	TeeTeeTee: I have to say, I was quite hoping that you'd miss that last move.
	wil: LOL....that is what I was going to say...  I was at the cusp, on the edge...of actually winning a game against you...now it is back to the foxhole to see if I can hold out against your far superior prowess!

41) TeeTeeTee: Attack G1 Gee2

42) wil: Discover Y2 Wil B2 B2

43) TeeTeeTee: Build Y1 G2

44) wil: Move Y2 Gtoo G3
	TeeTeeTee: ...? I don't get it.
	wil: I went to the wrong g2, foiled by my own devices...didn't check where it went and went to another game to make a move...CRAP
	wil: CRAP
	TeeTeeTee: Ahhhh... I'm actually sorry to hear that it was a typo. I don't believe that there's the opportunity to double-undo, is there?
 
If you like, I can wait a little longer before responding to moves in the future... but, I have to say, you should always double-check that you're moving to the right place before submitting orders. (Also, perhaps you should give more original names to your planets? :P)
	TeeTeeTee: Ohhh, very well. 
Would you like me to undo my last move, so that you can (potentially) undo your last move, and move your ship to the correct g2 (gtoo)?
	wil: nope...I screwed up... what a royal mistake!

	TeeTeeTee: Very well. (If it's any consolation, I reckon that moving the g1 to gtoo would've been a mistake, too - albeit not as drastic.)
	wil: I don't think you would have wasted y2 g3 g1 to catastrophe, it would have given me the opp to get back a factory and set you further behind...

	wil: and there it is...congrats..
	TeeTeeTee: ... Well, this one was a complex game. I've not played many games where I've both failed to monopolise a colour and been behind on large ships - it was not at all clear who was winning for most of this game, despite your lead on large ships.
 
My mistake in this game was not trying to cut you off from getting the large y3's, as I assuming that you couldn't build them without losing one of them to catastrophe immediately. It was only after you built the three large yellows that I saw that I'd have lost by `bluebird' if I'd done that: I couldn't destroy all three y3's in the same turn. (Also, as I said earlier, your response to "18: Trade r3 g3 TeeTeeTee" was a strong move.)
 
I think you made three major mistakes in this game. Firstly, I think that your moving that g1 out was a weak move, but not for the reason you thought it was. At this stage, you could only win the game by setting up a doomsday device, which you had the means to do - but you needed to trade that g1 for a b1 to start it, and you couldn't do that once you moved it out (even if you had moved it to the correct place!) I suppose now that you were planning to move the g1 to gtoo and on the next turn destroy my greens at Mercia by catastrophe? You'd have got a large green from that, but would no longer have had all the y3s, which was your greatest advantage in this game.
 
Secondly, I think "23: ... Build r2 g3" was not a good move, as it gave me the chance to monopolise the reds, which I'd been threatening to do all game. I would not have been able to invade, though, as I didn't have a y2 or a y3: but you would have had to have given one of them up to attack me. You could perhaps have scratched out a draw or even an unlikely win if you'd got some blue ships and blew up one of my homeworlds, but then you played "25 ... Move y2 g3 TeeTeeTee". I think that was your third mistake, and the move that lost you the game: without your yellows, you no longer had a chance to set up a doomsday machine before I invaded. You needed to try and blow up my blue homeworld first.
 
Once again, thanks for the game! This was definitely a tough one.
	wil: thanks for the feedback, sincerely appreciated!!
