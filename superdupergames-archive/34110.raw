	Trydnt: in the early game you'll often wanna copy what you opponent does. In this case I took the yellow because I need yellow and also there are only two of the y1's in there. That means if you don't take the other one I'll grow it on my next turn and monopolize the yellow and you will struggle to get into the yellow economy.

	Trydnt: once again I'll caution you against putting two of the same color ships on a star like that without a really good reason. you already have a green one there. adding another green one to that star gives you no added abilities and since you don't have any blue there you can't swap it for something that does. it also limits the amount of other ships you'll be able to grow on that star as one more and you're in serious danger of my blowing it up.
