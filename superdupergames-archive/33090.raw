	mneme: Incidentally, I'm not at all sure what Aaron's doing with the sorting on this site.
 
Homeworlds sorting is -simple-.  Top row is always player 0.  Bottom row is player 1.  2nd row is stuff that's (until things start getting blown up) 1 away from player 1; 4th row is stuff that's 1 away from player 2.  And then anything that deviates from this (or pretty much anything, in a small universe situation) goes further in the middle than that, or ideally offsides.
 
I'm not really sure what the logic here is, but at least to me it's exactly opposite from what I described -- cleo, then euterpe, then kermit.

	ts52: The sorting works the way I expect it to for a little while, but eventually starts to break down. But at the start it always shows your homeworld on the bottom row. Adjacent systems to your homeworld one row up. Your opponents homeworld at the top (the enemies gate is always up?) and adjacent systems to their homeworld one row down. 
	mneme: That's what I'd expect, yes.  But even with four worlds, I see your homeworld, then cleo and euterpe, then kermit, and finally my homeworld.  It may depend on what side you're sitting.

Catastrophe Ts52 B
	mneme: You too!
 
I'd have probably done the catastrophe -- though of course the squeeze is that you can't do both.

	mneme: True.  On the other hand, if you're going to go out, might as well do it with a bang.
 
I'm doing ok.  Enough that I'm resenting having to do it again inthe double elimination game--it's likely that the only game I lose (if any) is against wil.
