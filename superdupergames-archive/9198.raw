	zoltar: Oops. You have 4 greens in your homeworld.  If it were not for this fact, your move would be a good one.  Unfortunately, I can make any move (such as building the last green ship) and then add "c SpaceHobo g" as the last line of my move, and all your greens will blow up and your homeworld will be empty and you will lose the game.  So why don't you undo that move and make a different one, such as moving a green out or trading a green for another color.
