dsheldon: I think that might seal my victory. You'll have to trade to green, I'll take a step forward from Ocean. You'll have to build another ship. I'll move in to your homeworld. No matter what you do next I'll capture your entire fleet.
nycavri: I remain terrible at this game. I do seem to do better in person, rather than the "stop-start" nature of concentration online. Happy to play it out as ever.

47) dsheldon: Discover Y2 Ocean R1 Reaper

48) nycavri: Build G1 Nycavri
dsheldon: That wasn't terrible at all! It's got to end sometime. That's the real problem with these games, eventually someone has to win ;)

dsheldon: From what I remember of our last encounter, you've definitely improved. This was not easy.
nycavri: As I've commented before, there's an unforgiving learning curve. I may have "improved", but I have still lost 15 out of 16 games here . . . and the one was against another newbie who began by building one color in his Homeworld his first 3 turns and allowing me to blow up one of his stars!
nycavri: I don't mind losing - it's losing this consistently!

49) dsheldon: Move Y2 Reaper Nycavri

dsheldon: Hmm, I wish I had any kind of useful advice. I'll see if I can look over the log of this game and try to point out any glaring mistakes once it's over.

dsheldon: Here's a thought, take a look at the log yourself and tell me if there are any of my moves that really surprised you, and we'll see what you did to get to that situation.
nycavri: Thanks, I appreciate the offer of help - I'll see about looking back over this the next few days.
nycavri: Well played, by the way!
dsheldon: My pleasure. It's an especially satisfying victory because you were quite a worthy opponent.
nycavri: *blush*
