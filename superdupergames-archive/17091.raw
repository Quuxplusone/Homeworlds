Homeworlds Online (SDG# 17091)
Started: 2010.8.8, Ended: 2012.2.27
Participants: Galaxian (S), rootbier (N)
Winner: rootbier

1) rootbier: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3
	Galaxian: homeworld B2 Y1 G3
	Galaxian: Sorry, I'm new here.
	rootbier: No problem. New is fine. Have you played the game offline?
 
Your move is properly coded... but this is the chat area. You need to put your move in the box up at the top of the page... on the left side. You can also just use the first letters for commands. "h b2 y2 g3" is valid.
 
If you have never played - just ask for help. It's much more fun to teach as I go than to just play to win.

2) Galaxian: Homeworld B3 Y2 G3
	rootbier: Now it is your turn and you can build your homeworld. You probably want a home system with two different size stars for now. Get tricky later.

3) rootbier: Build G1 Rootbier
	Galaxian: Thanks!  I have played offline before, but I'm not very good at it.
	rootbier: Be aware that your choice of star sizes puts us very close. It is only two steps from your home to mine instead of the more standard three steps. 
 
This is okay - but it makes for a "faster" game.
 
Ask questions :) Or even just think out loud and I will help you talk/think through stuff or can tell you if your strategies/ways of thinking about the game seem sound.
	Galaxian: Yeah, sorry about that.  I just noticed it.
	rootbier: Do you want to go on with that or do you want to undo and choose another size star?

4) Galaxian: Build G1 Galaxian
	Galaxian: Oh.  I didn't know I could do that.  There you go.
