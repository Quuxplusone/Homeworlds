Homeworlds Online (SDG# 3293)
Started: 2006.4.30, Ended: 2006.5.4
Participants: TwoShort (S), GeepaMoogle (N)
Winner: TwoShort

1) GeepaMoogle: Homeworld B3 Y1 G3

2) TwoShort: Homeworld B2 R1 G3
	GeepaMoogle: Checking out your game with jeep by the way.  I may be in over my head..

3) GeepaMoogle: Build G1 Geepamoogle
	TwoShort: Well, for what it's worth, I think both Jeep and I feel in over our heads in that game :)  Anyway, have you played much Homeworlds before?
	GeepaMoogle: Not really.  Although I have tried to study some useful tactics to keep in mind, and the relative strengths and weaknesses of things.
	GeepaMoogle: A defensive side to your homeworld, eh?  Interesting.

4) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

5) GeepaMoogle: Discover G1 Geepamoogle Y2 Vesperoutpost
	GeepaMoogle: I really ought to play this by email sometime.  Perhaps with a separate account, so I can craft amusing stories as I play.  I saw one game that was logged and the text was amusing to say the least.  (Russell vs Andy, accessible from Wunderland somewhere)
	TwoShort: The red homeworld star is definitely contrary to conventional wisdom.  Jesse played it that way in our current game, and did well with it, so I figured I'd try it.  The advantage is not so much that it's red, but that it isn't green or yellow, letting you have more ships of those colors before you get close to a disaster... Or that's the theory anyway; first time I've tried it.

6) TwoShort: Trade G1 Y1 Twoshort

7) GeepaMoogle: Build G1 Geepamoogle
	GeepaMoogle: Save the choices which would give warnings, all opening star/ship trios might have some benefits.  Although I suspect that you want a blue and green somewhere, and you don't want a red ship in the normal setup.  (However, a red ship might be useful for a blitz set-up)

8) TwoShort: Build Y1 Twoshort

9) GeepaMoogle: Trade G1 B1 Geepamoogle

10) TwoShort: Discover Y1 Twoshort G3 Grogar

11) GeepaMoogle: Move B1 Geepamoogle Vesperoutpost

12) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort
	TwoShort: Without gree, the only thing you can do on your first turn is turn you ship green.  Without blue, you could theoretically grow, and then move to blue, but it would be pretty crippling.
	TwoShort: I can't really see starting twith a shiop that wasn't green or yellow either.

13) GeepaMoogle: Build B1 Vesperoutpost
	GeepaMoogle: Keep trying to think of other possible functions for ships  (outright destruction comes to mind) but nothing all that great can I come up with.

14) TwoShort: Discover G1 Twoshort Y3 Yolonda
	TwoShort: Well, actually, as the second player, I'll start with a b3 ship (and b1 star) if the opponent started with a b1 star, but that's a special case strategy.

15) GeepaMoogle: Trade B1 R1 Vesperoutpost
	GeepaMoogle: I will probably be back a bit later.  Hungry and I want to get a set of extra trees so I can have two games on table at one time (as well as the dice for a pattern matching game)
	GeepaMoogle: Nice..  You seem to have locked me out of yellow for now.

16) TwoShort: Sacrifice G3 Twoshort

18) TwoShort: Sacrifice Y2 Grogar
Discover Y1 Grogar R2 Doomtown
Move Y1 Doomtown Geepamoogle
	TwoShort: So as long as we're tossing around strategy tips; letting your opponent monopolize a color is bad, and that goes tripple for yellow :)


19) GeepaMoogle: Trade Y3 R3 Geepamoogle
	TwoShort: Sorry, I have a hard time not going for the throat when I see an opening...

20) TwoShort: Discover Y1 Geepamoogle B2 Sentrypost
	GeepaMoogle: I didn't consider you might attempt to cripple my people on the eve of crowning the newest cruise vessel.  They have demanded your head now.  (Space cruises can come later.)

21) GeepaMoogle: Build G1 Vesperoutpost
	TwoShort: Clearly a warlike weapon-building people such as yourselves must be contained. I'm afraid we cannot allow you access to hyperdrive technology.

22) TwoShort: Trade Y3 G3 Twoshort
	GeepaMoogle: We have done your people no harm, nor have we invaded your space.  Our enforcer ships are strictly defensive.
 
That and your scouting ship nearly ran the Queen Mary space cruiser into the planet.  The results would have been devestating.

23) GeepaMoogle: Move G1 Vesperoutpost Geepamoogle

24) TwoShort: Build G2 Twoshort
	TwoShort: We were simply trying to help out your celebration with an exciting fireworks display.  Sorry you got the wrong impression.  Hopefully we'll have another opportunity to share our fine fireworks with you soon.

25) GeepaMoogle: Build G2 Geepamoogle
	GeepaMoogle: Well, next time, do check with Vesper Defense Outpost.  All Federation traffic is supposed to flow through there.  Our scientists report a star explosion in the general direction your ship came from.  Your pilot might need a vacation.

26) TwoShort: Sacrifice G3 Twoshort

	TwoShort: Such beaueaucratic restrictions mean fireworks shows will take considerably more resources to arrange.  We'll just have to set up a little factory to speed up production.

27) GeepaMoogle: Trade R3 Y3 Geepamoogle
	GeepaMoogle: It's not beaurocratic.  We just want to make sure the guy running the fireworks knows how to handle them safely.  Our galactic coroners have determined "fireworks" were the reason that one star exploded.  Luckily, that planet was only inhabited by telemarketers, so everything ended up OK.
	GeepaMoogle: Also curious, do I seem to be on the road to recovery?  It's 1L,1M,4S vs 1L,2M,3S at the moment for whatever that is worth.
	TwoShort: Well, honestly, I think you're doomed.  My basic thought on things to look at is Who has more 3 pointers? and Who has more yellow, particularly 2 & 3 pointers?  So I'm slightly ahead now, but I also have a factory going, which I'll use this turn to take the rest of the green so you can't set up your own factory, and in 2-3 turns I'll use it to take 2 of the 3 remaining yellows.  On the other hand, I thought I had you finished off when I threw the yellow into your homeworld,  so a comeback might well be possible... but it doesn't look good. 

28) TwoShort: Trade G2 R2 Twoshort
	TwoShort: Um, I mean, production is ramping up, and we look forward to brining the people of GeepaMoogle some fine fireworks displays in the future!

29) GeepaMoogle: Build G2 Vesperoutpost
	GeepaMoogle: Sucks to get off to an early bad start.  Ah well, it would seem we have reaquired our Queen Mary after a ramp down of security.  Politicians were worried to learn someone was buying up all the cocktail napkins, so were motivated to pass the measure restoring her before it was too late.

	TwoShort: Our forces at sentryPost have grown tired of sitting there watching the exciting goings on on your homeworld, and have decided to come visit.  Naturally, they'd like to celebrate this meeting of our cultures with a fine fireworks display!

	TwoShort: And now I'm sure I have you; I've got 3 pointers and you don't, and I can keep you from getting any before I use mine to take over your homeworld.
	GeepaMoogle: Bleh.  Is there any place that has a list of useful tactics and traps to watch for?

	GeepaMoogle: I know it's over, just keeping the game alive until I get a response.
	TwoShort: There's the wiki here, and the one at icehousegames.org, but the total amount of strategic advice there isn't that great.  Certainly the best way to learn is by playing;  I'll certainly be happy to play again any time.  If you like, we could play an unrated game- I'll still play the same way, but I'll feel freer to blather on about the strategies I'm trying and what I'm thinking at each stage.  I like talking about homeworlds stragtegy about as much as I like playing, but in a rated game I can't bring myself to tell you to look out for the surprise attack you might not be seeing...
	TwoShort: Oh, and just so you know, I beleive you can keep chatting in a game even after it ends...
