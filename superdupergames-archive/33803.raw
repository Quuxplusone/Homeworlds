Started: 2018.2.21, Ended: 2018.2.26
Participants: mneme (S), wil (N)
Winner: wil

1) wil: Homeworld B2 Y1 G3

2) mneme: Homeworld R1 G3 B3
	wil: I'd say good luck...but we both know it is I who needs it!
	wil: Have a great game...hope I can challenge you a tad.

3) wil: Build G1 Wil
	mneme: We both need it!  We'll see how things go!  And good luck! (also, as I prefer in non-random games, ganbatte!)

	mneme: Still, I'm going second which I admit is my favored positon.

4) mneme: Build B1 Mneme
	mneme: Helps if I don't accidentally make a small universe, though.
	wil: Second is best...I wanted to pass...but I see that as bad form...the computer flips the coin.

5) wil: Trade G1 R1 Wil

6) mneme: Trade B1 Y1 Mneme
	mneme: pass means I could force a tie if I wanted to.  Not sure what that does for tournament, though.


7) wil: Build R1 Wil
	wil: what is the rule on back and forth for ties?

	mneme: all pass  = tie


8) mneme: Build Y1 Mneme

9) wil: Build R2 Wil
	wil: what about back and forth later in the game?

10) mneme: Build Y2 Mneme

11) wil: Discover R1 Wil G3 G3
	mneme: there is no autotie.  I've offered ties in homeworlds once maybe because of a cycle, but it usually doesn't happen.


12) mneme: Discover Y1 Mneme G2 Polyhymnia

13) wil: Discover R2 Wil Y3 Y3

14) mneme: Build Y2 Polyhymnia

15) wil: Move R2 Y3 Polyhymnia

16) mneme: Sacrifice Y1 Polyhymnia
Discover Y2 Polyhymnia G1 Erato
	Babamots: I think I failed to specify what happens in the event of a tie in the bracket phase. I suppose the most sensible thing would be to just play again.

Build R2 G3
Build R3 Wil

18) mneme: Build B1 Mneme

19) wil: Trade R3 Y3 Wil

22) mneme: Build Y1 Erato

23) wil: Build R3 G3

24) mneme: Build Y2 Erato

25) wil: Move Y3 Wil G3
	wil: I think you probably made the best of all possible bad moves available..  Unless you have a trick up your sleeve, I think you need me to make some mistake..

26) mneme: Build Y3 Mneme
	mneme: We'll see how it goes. I certainly have a considerable numerical disadvantage.

27) wil: Move R3 G3 Erato
	wil: I was torn between this and sacking the Y3, backing up an R3 into my HW moving the r1 out to a b3 and moving an R2 into your yellows...but I don't have the ability to ponder long...

28) mneme: Sacrifice Y2 Erato
Discover Y1 Erato B3 Euterpe
Discover Y2 Erato B3 Calliope

29) wil: Build R3 G3

30) mneme: Sacrifice Y2 Mneme
Move Y2 Calliope Wil
Move Y1 Euterpe Wil
	wil: I am so bad at thinking before my move...and do nothing but second guess after my move.

31) wil: Sacrifice Y3 G3
Move R3 Erato Polyhymnia
Move R3 Polyhymnia Mneme
Move R3 Polyhymnia Mneme

32) mneme: Attack R3 Mneme
	mneme: That's what I'm counting on.  As it were.

33) wil: Sacrifice R3 G3
Attack R3 Mneme
Attack G3 Mneme
Attack Y3 Mneme

	wil: I had figured I needed it more than another y...
	wil: trying for monopolies is a thing...maintaining them is a challenge.  It wasn't my intention...but when you decided to not play follow the leader, that gave me a choice, abandon red and get a yellow before I can't...which meant you just got the first move advantage from second place...or race with you.
	wil: I was hoping to get to the end and play you in the best of three...feel free to challenge me anytime.  I feel you are far better than I and I got lucky early here.
	mneme: So much of this game is decided in the opening unless someone makes a mistake (and I did; I shouldn't have let you contorol Red so thoroughly, though there was a period where it was possible your limited movement/growth might have let me turn it around).
 
  Good luck in the tornament!
	mneme: Without the R you wouldn't have been able to win; can't take over my home system as easily when I can cat R in response!
	wil: quite, and thanx for the game.
