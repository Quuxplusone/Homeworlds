eugman: Hmmm I forgot I really can't get back now. Hmm this will take a bit of thinking.

30) zoltar: Sacrifice G3 Zoltar
Build G3 Zoltar
Build G3 Kale
Build R3 Lemon
zoltar: My only reasonable chance to catch up has been to build a 'factory': I have a g3 and one other green piece in my homeworld (or another star, but that is more rare), and all the greens are used up. I can then sack my G3 and then rebuild it immediately in place, plus two other builds.
eugman: Ah so that's what's meant exactly by factory.

31) eugman: Sacrifice Y3 Lime
Move R2 Kale Lime
Move R2 Kale Lime

eugman: Keith: FWIW you have an audience. This game is quite the spectator sport. --Keith
eugman: I have a feeling this is going to go downhill for me and fast.

eugman: Please let me know if what I'm about to do it very clever or not.

32) zoltar: Sacrifice G3 Kale
Build G3 Kale
Build Y3 Collards
Build Y3 Swisschard
eugman: actually that may have been a bad idea.
eugman: hmm
eugman: This can wait a day. This is a very bad situation so I need a move that is very good.
zoltar: Yes, it would leave me with an advantage in red tech. Remember, I don't need red ships in my homeworld to defend, as I can sac one of my reds elsewhere. The perfect 'castle' in a yb star system, btw, would be to have a g3 and r1 and nothing else; that way the red could defend against any one piece, an r2 or r3 elsewhere could be sacked to stop multiple invaders, and with one of each color, the system would be maximally stable and thus hardest to create a catastrophe. Here blowing up my two r1's would be a waste of your resources.
eugman: Well I'm going to lose most of my red tech soon anyways since you can just sac a red 2 and cap my 2 reds there.
zoltar: Yes, it was an unfortunate side-effect of your sacking your G3, as not only could I build the G3 immediately, but I could threaten your red ships as well before they could disperse and build R3s. Notice also that if you move one of them, I can capture the other with an R1 sac, so that you can't build an R3 right away as there is then an R1 in the stash. Given all that, I think your G3 sack was a mistake. However, I didn't expect it, and it was a very clever try, something that usually makes for a great move but in this case had severe tactical drawbacks.
eugman: It doesn't look like something I'm going to be able to recover from. I think I'll carry this out to it's near end tomorrow and then see if I can beat someone who isn't omniscient.
zoltar: If it makes you feel any better, I played world champion Andy Looney in person just last week, and lost for the nth time, though for the first time I actually blew up one of his homeworld stars before I died. Heh.

33) eugman: Build R3 Lime
eugman: Couldn't see what much else I could do.

34) zoltar: Sacrifice Y3 Swisschard
Move R2 Lemon Lime
Move R1 Zoltar Lemon
Move R1 Lemon Lime
Catastrophe Lime R

35) eugman: Build Y3 Lime
eugman: At least now I know about the factory effect so I can deal with Keiths attempt to do the same thing.

36) zoltar: Sacrifice G3 Kale
Build G3 Kale
Build R1 Lemon
Build R2 Zoltar
zoltar: Yes, the factory is a really powerful tool, if you can set one up. I don't mind sacrificing here, as I can build reds faster than you can.

37) eugman: Move R1 Eugman Lime

38) zoltar: Sacrifice Y2 Collards
Move R2 Zoltar Kale
Move R1 Lemon Collards
zoltar: Of course I did give you yet another Y3, but I like my advantage
eugman: Well I'm pretty sure I've lost. I can't assault you because you have suffiecent red tech. If I sit around you'll keep hitting me with your exploding ships(tm).

39) eugman: Move B1 Eugman Lime
eugman: The only way I could win would be o expand out, and find a way to bomb both of your homeworlds. An unlikely proposition

40) zoltar: Sacrifice G3 Kale
Build R2 Lemon
Build R3 Kale
Build R3 Collards

zoltar: Yes, you have to expand, but I can expand faster, with my factory, and I have all the big red ships now.
eugman: Well I've essentially lost. I'm going to resign to lighten my load since I've got four other games on the stack and two are homeworlds. I definately learned something that will help me in my game against keith. At least I had the momentum for a while this time.
zoltar: You played quite well. When you have less games going on, let's play again!
