	Simon: Again, have fun!
	Trydnt: you too :)

3) Simon: Build B1 Simon

4) Trydnt: Build G1 Trydnt
	Trydnt: so few people start with goldilocks. what is your thinking in doing so if I may ask

5) Simon: Build B1 Simon
	Simon: Hmm, Goldilocks gives most control over when/which 3-pip pieces become available.
	Trydnt: surely that would be banker as you can go straight to the 3s and if you can defend them you can turn them into ships later

6) Trydnt: Build G1 Trydnt

7) Simon: Trade B3 Y3 Simon
	Simon: Banker prevents 3-pips, Goldilocks enables 3-pips :)
	Trydnt: but only in the mid-to-late game and at that point surely your opponent can usually fly to the 2 pip stars too and have the same advantage. banker you leave one more 3 pip piece in the bank and you can fly to them so you can control which ones your opponent can and cannot grow

	Simon: gg, enjoy first place!
	Trydnt: Well played! That was one hell of a game. Even once I had a material advantage you really made me work for it. I doubt I'll last that long but good to be on top for however short a time :)
	Simon: It's the textbook example game for the g3 ship. The problem of green home star, then trading b3 starting ship into y3, is that it cannot contest monopolies in red/green.
 
I'll have to study this opening even deeper, and see how expensive it have been be to make an early green ship. In the game, the first 10 moves felt like a one-way street and yet it reached a disadvantage even as first-moving player.
	Trydnt: Yeah I see what you mean. You kind of have to bank on getting a b2 forward to a star in time to trade it for a remaining g2 but that also makes it hard to get an early y2 which can be essential to limiting your opponents growth
