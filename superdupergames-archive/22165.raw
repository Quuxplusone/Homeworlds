	dlwillson: Sorry for the delay, Twoshort. You're a dangerous man, and this board is interesting. I'm going to set up some plastic before I take my turn. I wonder when there will be a better Homeworlds computer program...
	dlwillson: Well, Heck, real life is too busy for the setting up of pointy plastic pyramids. Instead, it's a all pointy priorities. Pfah...
	dlwillson: I have a terribly risky move that I want to do, just to see what happens. I'd rather have looked it over in 3D first, but oh well. Let's see how this pans out. Worst case, I'll get to have a game with Tripp before I play you again. Best case, I get a lead and maybe win.
