	rootbier: Thanks for taking the challenge. Have a good game.
	MagicJohn: This is my second game of HW.  I'm looking forward to seeing new approaches and strategies. Have a good game.

5) MagicJohn: Trade R1 Y1 Magicjohn
	rootbier: welcome to the game. i just flicked through the first few moves of your first (didn't know I could do that didja? :))
 
and i'll tell you one thing that definitely won't work -- building four of the same color straight out like both you and ringebri did - it is possible to call catastrophes from all the way across the universe - rengebri could have beat you without doing anything on just his fourth move-- you could have done it to him on your fifth and sixth
 
so. good plan on your next is trade. then start building up again. getting up to size 2 ships won't help if they can all just be catastrophied away. :)
 
i'm no super pro but i've been playing a bunch lately and getting better - ask along the way if you have questions or concerns

6) rootbier: Trade G1 Y1 Rootbier
	rootbier: I flipped through a bit more of the game. I see you started to get the catastrophe's after a bit. They are far and away the most dangerous part of the game. Attacking is more or a defensive threat than anything. Best of luck :)

21) MagicJohn: Trade R1 Y1 Magicjohn
	MagicJohn: I wondered if you would sacrifice two ships to destroy three. Found out.....
	rootbier: you also have to consider the size of the ships - i lost a 1 and a 2 - you lost 2 2s and a 3. so yeah - i calc that as worth it.

22) rootbier: Move Y3 Pickle Patches

23) MagicJohn: Build Y2 Magicjohn
	MagicJohn: Kinda screws up my logistics too.

24) rootbier: Attack Y1 Patches

	MagicJohn: Sorry about the time-warp. I was trying to make the game do something it objected to. Had to re-read the rules. Didn't know that all actions resulting from a sacrifice had to correspond to the color of the sacrificed ship.

	rootbier: Did we time-warp? OOH!
I'm unclear-- did you think sacrifice was "Do whatever the heck you want!" or... did you think it just meant "Take X number of legal actions."?

	MagicJohn: Kind of a "Spite Check".  BP must be at work on rootbier as well as TP.  Perhaps I could have captured a couple of blue ships and flown them out next turn, but this was more fun. 
	MagicJohn: Thanks for the game....... learned a lot
	rootbier: We'll do another one after I am back from this conference thing next Monday.
	MagicJohn: OK
