H means home, then two available pyramids for stars, then one more available pyramid for your first ship.

	dlwillson: The only sensible move is: b g1 boredman
	BoredMan: ok it's the first time I play this game as well :D
	dlwillson: Well, have fun! It's my thousandth, or so. I love this game. There's a strategy guide around somewhere. My most highly recommended opponents are Felix and Wil.
	BoredMan: Hmm if I type in "b g1" is says the sytem doesn't exist.
	dlwillson: Read the recognized commands section of this page.
 
You have to specify which system you want to build the g1 in.
