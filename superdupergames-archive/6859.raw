4) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

5) clockwise: Trade G1 B1 Clockwise

6) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

7) clockwise: Build B2 Clockwise
	TwoShort: I was wondering if you would go for that... 

8) TwoShort: Trade G1 Y1 Twoshort

9) clockwise: Discover B2 Clockwise G3 Spawningpool
	clockwise: I generally think it's a terrible idea to start with a small of the same color as the starting player. If you were a weaker player I'd assume it was just bad play, but right now I'm wondering if instead it is some sort of trap.
	TwoShort: Lately I've been responding to your opening (or any with a b1 star) with G3 B1 B3, enabling me to grow the final B1 on the first turn before the opponent can do anything about it.  This has been fairly effective, but I theorize that this is because my opponents don't handle it well.  So in order to test this theory, I was somewhat interested in having someone put the freeze-out on me for a change.  So, a trap?  Not really.  I wanted you to do it, but I don't have a concrete plan what to do next, and I'm wondering if it was really a bad idea...

10) TwoShort: Build Y1 Twoshort
	clockwise: In this case I think I have three main advantages that the G3 B1 B3 opening doesn't have: Tempo, immediate access to yellow, and the ability to safely factory in my homesystem.  I guess we'll see how it turns out.

11) clockwise: Build B2 Spawningpool

12) TwoShort: Discover Y1 Twoshort B2 Bluestar

13) clockwise: Build B3 Spawningpool

14) TwoShort: Build Y1 Twoshort

15) clockwise: Trade B3 Y3 Spawningpool
	TwoShort: Did I say something about having any theory whatsoever about what the bleep I'm doing?  
Heh.

16) TwoShort: Discover Y1 Twoshort Y2 Yolonda
	clockwise: Well two good things about this game are that it is different from most, and that it is moving quickly...

17) clockwise: Build Y2 Spawningpool
	clockwise: Nice play
	TwoShort: Well, my basic theory for dealing with the blue freeze-out (mostly ignore it, and push yellow) seems to be working out; but I hope your delay in making the next move isn't from discouragement, because I think your position is still pretty strong.  I'm having to resist posting an extensive analysis of what I think you should do :)  
	clockwise: No, not discouragement, but need to sit down and work things through, and I've been pretty busy with other things.
	clockwise: You can give me an analysis of what you think I should do at this point once the game is done ;)

18) TwoShort: Sacrifice G3 Twoshort
Build Y3 Bluestar
Build Y3 Twoshort
Build G1 Twoshort
	clockwise: My own analysis is that unless I have a second yellow it will be very hard to win... though I don't like letting you into the large pieces.
	TwoShort: That's essentially what I was thinking, except to note that letting me into the Y3s was not avoidable :)

19) clockwise: Build B3 Spawningpool

20) TwoShort: Discover Y1 Yolonda B3 Borbor

21) clockwise: Build B3 Clockwise

22) TwoShort: Sacrifice G1 Twoshort
Build Y2 Borbor

23) clockwise: Discover Y3 Spawningpool G2 Ultralisk
	clockwise: So, I'm guessing you're Robert over on the icehouse list.  Does that mean I could win the zpips if I win this game, or would that only apply to a game where you hadn't intentionally crippled yourself at the start?  :)
	TwoShort: Yes I am, but sorry, you'll have to start a new game if you want the ZPIPs.  I think "pursued a dubious experimental strategy" sounds better than "intentionally crippled yourself", but yeah... :)
	clockwise: Only reasonable I suppose.

24) TwoShort: Trade Y2 R2 Borbor

25) clockwise: Trade B2 R2 Spawningpool

26) TwoShort: Trade Y3 G3 Twoshort

37) clockwise: Build R1 Ultralisk

38) TwoShort: Sacrifice Y1 Twoshort
Move R2 Glenwood Ultralisk
Catastrophe Ultralisk Red
	TwoShort: I can't say I'm thrilled with my chances, but I imagine I can make you work for it :)

39) clockwise: Build Y1 Ultralisk
	clockwise: Yeah I do still have a strong advantage; I just have to be careful so that I don't make some little mistake which lets you turn the tides...  For the tides, they are fickle in homeworlds.

40) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort
	clockwise: I was wondering if you'd accept that exchange.

41) clockwise: Build B2 Clockwise

42) TwoShort: Build G2 Bluonia
	TwoShort: I wasn't crazy about it, but if I let you blow up my red star, I wasn't going to be able to stop you from taking out the blue one in short order.

43) clockwise: Trade B2 R2 Clockwise

44) TwoShort: Trade G2 Y2 Bluonia

45) clockwise: Trade G3 Y3 Clockwise

47) clockwise: Sacrifice Y1 Ultralisk
Move B3 Borbor Bluonia
	clockwise: You'd have been better off trading the g1.
	TwoShort: And you'd have been better off not saying anything... I might not have seen it :) The wasted turn isn't what I needed though.


	clockwise: I probably would have kept quiet, except that I believe it was already to late.
	TwoShort: Ahh... so it is.  Great game.  Whenever you're ready for a rematch, let me know!
