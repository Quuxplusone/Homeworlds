20) AdamBadura: Build G3 Bombay
	AdamBadura: I read the rules which are available here. There are two things which you tought me differently (or at least I understood it so):
1) You homeworld can be made up from two pieces of the same size or same color (however sam color is useless and very risky).
2) While using attack action you can capture an enemy ship which is not larger than your largest ship in that system; while I thought it is that you may capture a ship which is not larger than your largest red ship in that system.

21) goulo: Build G3 Mumbai
	goulo: Oh, I didn't remember/know your home system could have two pieces of the same size! Interesting!
 
The attack information indeed changes things. I'm not sure if I knew that or not. :)  This is one of those games where I find myself continually making silly errors (e.g. trying to build when I have no green, etc), so even though I "know" the rules theoretically, I don't "know" them deeply and automatically and instinctively yet. Which is interesting, because the rules really are pretty simple, yet somehow they are very mind-bending. :)

30) AdamBadura: Sacrifice R3 Adambadura
Attack B3 Goulo
Attack Y2 Goulo
Attack R1 Goulo

	goulo: Oh crap, I forgot about that whole "you don't need a red ship there to capture" thing. :/
	AdamBadura: I think you should have accepted the los of G. Now it seems you will loose the game instead. But maybe I'm mistaken?
 
Why do you think 3 and 2 initial stars are bad?
	goulo: Let's see, you have 11 ships, I have 6 ships...
	AdamBadura: I considered suggesting another undo but you already did one and also I didn't want to sound arrogant. :)
 
But if you want to we may start a new game and repeat it step by step to that point so you can chose a different approach. However it seems the situation was difficult for you anyway.
	AdamBadura: But I don't think the numer of ships we have has anything to do with sizes of stars we started with. Colors may do matter thou.
	goulo: 3 & 2 star seems bad because it really hurt my mobility to leave my star, as many of the 1-pyramids were gone when I wanted to move out.
	goulo: I doubt I was going to find a way to win this game after you pulled the trigger with the double invasion and threat to catastrophe in 2 places.
	goulo: BTW I just geekmailed the guy who taught me homeworlds to see if he wants to play 3-player with us. :)
	goulo: And now I pause to do "real world" stuff. :)
	AdamBadura: Great! Awaiting...
