31) nycavri: Move B1 Jw Greenbelt
	zoltar: hold on a sec, I need to think for a minute about this -- I may have an interesting sacrifice

32) zoltar: Trade Y3 G3 Zoltar
	zoltar: This would usually be suicidal, leaving two of my systems so vulnerable with three yellows in each, especially my homeworld, but as you only have a y1, I can get away with it and then separate my pieces or change colors if you threaten to blow up a system.
	nycavri: I saw this move, and figured it was 50/50 you doing it.  Gives you strong color position, but leaves you potentially vulnerable.  I took into account my response if you did go for it.....  

33) nycavri: Trade R1 Y1 Greenbelt
	nycavri: At this point in my Homeworlds career, I understand the game, I see dangers one (or sometimes 2) move away, but haven't yet enough experience to spot problems before that, or to disguise my attacks against you.  I feel like I've improved in each of my 3 games, but at some point I lose ground in the "arms race" and spend the rest of the time unsuccessfully trying to catch up again.  Usually ends with me hoping you make a mistake, which to date you have avoided.  In all, this speaks to a well designed game.....

34) zoltar: Trade Y1 R1 Zoltar

35) nycavri: Build Y1 Greenbelt

36) zoltar: Build Y3 Zoltar
	zoltar: I can get a red ship and stop you from getting a Y3 all in one move, so that was a very efficient move, I figure!

	zoltar: Well, I'm grabbing the big ships, and now have to hope I can stop you from blowing them up before I can spread them out...

41) nycavri: Build Y2 Fr

42) zoltar: Sacrifice R1 Zoltar
Attack G3 Nycavri
	zoltar: Hey wait a second, you got rid of your red ship and you don't have a red star in your homeworld -- no need to chase the pawns when I can go for the checkmate!

43) nycavri: Sacrifice B1 Greenbelt
Trade Y2 R2 Fr

44) zoltar: Trade B3 R3 Nycavri
	zoltar: You needed to trade your yellow for a red again that last move, as with my having a red ship and you without one, and my having 3-sized ships that can reach your homeworld in one move with a yellow sacrifice, I have checkmate if you don't build a 'gun' somewhere to defend your homeworld.

45) nycavri: Build Y2 Fr

46) zoltar: Attack Y1 Nycavri
	nycavri: I hear what you're saying, but it's not like I'd have been in any better shape if I'd traded for red last turn....
	zoltar: Sure you would, as you could sac your r1 and capture my B3 if I put it in your homeworld!  Now it's mate in 1.

	zoltar: The crucial thing to remember is to always have a 3-sized ship in your homeworld and a red ship somewhere, so that you are defended from 3-sized ships attacking.
	nycavri: Right, a turn or two earlier I could have rebuilt a red.
