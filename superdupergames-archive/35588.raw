	wil: Lol, right!
	wil: I take great pride in losing to you!
	Trydnt: I've largely stopped paying attention to winning and losing and focused more on how to extract the most information from every game to improve my strategies. I'd like to play more weird universe games like this though. I think that an AI will struggle to code switch like we do when taking a different homeworld setup and I'd like to be able to give a supercomputer a proper challenge
	wil: U way to smart for me
