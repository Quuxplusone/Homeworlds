7) Felix: B R2 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: Sometimes I have thought about a blue-less variant where you start with 3 ships, one of each size. It certainly eases the opening.
	Felix: That would be interesting, but would also probably increase the first player advantage rather greatly. I suppose you could alternate choices, but that's essentially what you do in the first few rounds, anyway. It may unnecessarily complicate the initial setup rather than lettting it happen organically  through play, even if the first few moves are usually a bit dru
	Felix: Dry, that is.

8) Draw5PlayAll: Build R2 Draw5playall

9) Felix: B R2 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: I sometimes wonder if I would be better off taking (say) the yellow economy while you grab red, and then trading into red once I break the medium barrier.

10) Draw5PlayAll: Trade R2 Y2 Draw5playall
	Felix: That's often the question! Which path is better? I'm still figuring it out myself...

	Draw5PlayAll: [Begin Narration]
 
We were shocked to find that once again the aliens from the planet Felix have pursued hostile action. Noticing dangerous radiation buildup from the presence of three red ships in the same star system, we decided on a bold plan: build a fourth red ship and trigger a radiation catastrophe. It appears the plan has worked, as all enemy ships are destroyed and we now control our colony system again.

22) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall
	Felix: Plan thwarted. Begin rebuilding of primary weapon systems.

23) Felix: B R2 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: We are attempting to regroup as the attack left us with zero weaponry other than our red star.

27) Felix: Discover R1 Felix B1 Stash
	Draw5PlayAll: Sensing the possibility of a hostile "visitor" we have dropped our plans with the blue economy and instead we have gained a weapon.

28) Draw5PlayAll: Build Y2 G2
	Felix: There's only one solution to the opponent having weapons.... MORE WEAPONS!
	Draw5PlayAll: I see in your log that you captured the Klingons long ago. We are more interested in wormhole technology.

	Draw5PlayAll: You are unable to keep this up forever, or else we get a dr... wait, SDG does not allow draws of any form. I wonder if I can hijack the POST request for a Martian Chess draw offer.
	Draw5PlayAll: Okay, so I tried just now to copy the form element from a Martian Chess game and then change what was required... and nothing happened.

	Felix: Thank you! It was a good game. I didn't expect you to draw it out longer by catastropheing my two large yellows, so that was a good move. Well played! I've enjoyed seeing you get better. Maybe I'll face you in the ladder soon!
	Draw5PlayAll: My plan is to get to #1 by waiting until you are off of there. But you will very likely kick me off.
	Felix: Currently wil is number one. There are plenty of other strong players you need to worry about more than me!
	Draw5PlayAll: Yeah, I think I have a good shot at beating wil, but sadly I am challenging dlwillson and he will likely kill me with the red economy.
