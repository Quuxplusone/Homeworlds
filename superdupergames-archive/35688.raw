Homeworlds Online (SDG# 35688)
Started: 2019.11.6, Ended: 2019.11.9
Participants: Babamots (S), Cuc (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) Cuc: H B1 G2 Y3
	Babamots: Hi! Do I remember right that you've played HW often in-person but never online? Let me know if you need any help with the commands.
 
And it sounded like you've been making new notes on Homeworlds. I'd be happy to see them when you want to share.
 
Good luck!
	Cuc: How to enter a move? I try this message. Do I use the notes?

2) Babamots: Homeworld G3 B1 B3 *
	Cuc: Ah, I now assume this input field is indeed the chat field.
	Cuc: So, yes I'm the guy asking you about the tournament and I played several games in person. The doc can be found here: http://tinyurl.com/BC-Homeworlds-V1. Substantial feedback is welcome per email, see doc.
	Babamots: Looks like you figured out how to enter moves and messages :-).
 
Notes are just for your own reference. No other players can see them. I think notes are meant for long games when you expect to lose track of what your plan was before your next turn. My notes are usually things like: "Consider continuing to build yellow. Don't worry about being attacked just yet since his red ship would take two turns to arrive."

3) Cuc: B Y1 Cuc
	Cuc: Do you have guidelines to identify SS? Short but clear? I'd hate to type in long names all the time . . . My proposal: use starcolor+starsize+seqletter. Example. I'd enter B Y1 N, then D Y1 N Y3 "y3a", etc.

4) Babamots: Build B1 Babamots
	Cuc: I'm glad I've got a small user name! I tried N, but it wouldn't take the command.

5) Cuc: B Y1 Cuc
	Cuc: Ah! N is the "seat assignment".
	Cuc: B Y1 CUC

6) Babamots: Trade B3 Y3 Babamots
	Babamots: I have always used worlds from Star Trek as system names (Bolarus is a blue system since Bolians have blue skin, Romulus is a red system since Romulans are aggressive, etc.).
 
I can take it easy on your fingers by using short Star Trek names if you prefer.

7) Cuc: T Y1 G1 Cuc
	Cuc: I tried "T Y1 B1 Cuc" but it won't accept it, what now?
	Babamots: You can't trade for a b1 since the b1 pieces are gone. That was my devious plan in choosing my home colors.

8) Babamots: Build B2 Babamots

9) Cuc: D G1 Cuc B3 B3a
	Cuc: Cool! I figured it out 1 sec before I read your answer. Thx!
	Cuc: I'll take it slower from here, say once half an hour. I'll time it. Thx.
	Babamots: It's normal to play fast for a few moves and then slow down to a move every 12 to 48 hours. No worries.

10) Babamots: Discover B1 Babamots G2 Orion

11) Cuc: B G1 B3a
	Cuc: One more thing, I'm 5 hours behind the clock on this site. You?

12) Babamots: Build B2 Babamots
	Cuc: I realize that I can build a B2, though. It seems I need to get used to the graphical representation. I'm used to play with real pyramids. I did not expect that to interfere with my understanding of what I can do, but it did. That's why your joke is now hitting me, haha.
	Babamots: I'm in the Eastern USA time zone and the clock has always bee right for me.
 
For me, playing with real pyramids is unfamiliar. It's very strange for me to reach around the table and move pieces rather than just type commands. With pieces, I find myself reluctant to make new systems because of that bit of extra work to figure where to physically put them.

13) Cuc: B G1 B3a

14) Babamots: Trade B2 G2 Babamots

15) Cuc: T G1 Y1 B3a
	Cuc: On a table of 3 ft across, it's very convenient. I like to think I'm replaying an episode of star wars and arrange my pieces in a triangle, large in front.
In my doc you'll find 3 variants of Homeworks I invented. The third is "Homeworlds 3000" that allowed more than one ability to be used during one turn. I'm eager to test it out. Is it possible to propose variants (or any game) to SDG development?
I did not include a discussion about the different Homeworlds yet. Notation may not yet be consistent, but I'd prefer to identify a ship by location first, not ship first like here on SDG. I may add the naming convention I'm using in our game. Because it's the closest to what you're doing with real pyramids. You don't give names, but identify a system by it's star, naturally.

16) Babamots: Discover G2 Babamots B2 Bajor
	Cuc: How do you monitor your game? It seems you respond pretty fast. It's appreciated. I normally refresh the screen.

17) Cuc: B Y1 B3a
	Babamots: I have an alert set up on my phone. When I get an email from SDG, there's a special chime. If I'm at a computer, I often move within a minute.

18) Babamots: Build Y2 Babamots
	Babamots: SDG isn't under development anymore. Aaron is working on a totally new and improved site called Abstract Play. Right now it's just a development blog that hasn't bee updated lately:
 
https://www.abstractplay.com/
	Cuc: Cool! I'll try and remember that. Soon I'm getting a new phone, but I normally do not use sounds on my phone. I may make an exception . . .

19) Cuc: D Y1 Cuc G3 G3a

20) Babamots: Build B2 Orion
	Babamots: Hmm, I'll probably need to come back to this and pick a move in the morning.
	Cuc: Ok, no. It was fun today! Thx.
	Cuc: No = np

21) Cuc: B Y2 G3a

22) Babamots: Build B3 Orion
	Cuc: I've got about 20 min till 2:40p

23) Cuc: B Y2 Cuc

24) Babamots: Trade B3 Y3 Orion

25) Cuc: D G1 B3a R2 R2a

26) Babamots: Build B3 Orion

27) Cuc: T Y3 B3 Cuc

28) Babamots: Trade B3 R3 Orion
	Cuc: It's getting dangerous . . . 

29) Cuc: T B3 R3 Cuc
	Babamots: Yep, any slip from either of us could be deadly. Both players having lots of yellow seems to do that.

30) Babamots: Build Y3 Orion

31) Cuc: B R1 Cuc
	Cuc: I undid my last move, because I realized I need to have a Large Red in my HW, but mainly to test the UNDO button/function. 
 
Also, I got the insight that if I need to refer to any longnamed Star System, I can simply copy it from the log below. Problem solved. In any case, I still like my naming, so I don't get distracted.
	Babamots: Notice that the UNDO button only works once per move. I think there may also be a time limit where, even if your opponent hasn't moved yet, the UNDO button disappears after a few days. I haven't studied it carefully though.
	Babamots: I've often considered annoying my opponents by using barcode system names made of I's (capital i) and l's (lowercase L). My opponent would have to copy and paste the name from the log every time. Not very good sportsmanship, but it could wear down their willpower.

32) Babamots: Build B3 Orion
	Babamots: 
	Babamots: I think you made your best move, but it doesn't take a large red to attack a large red. Any large ship can attack if there is a friendly red in the system (or sacrificed). It sounded like you might have forgotten the rules slightly, and thinking that only red ships can attack is a common mistake.
 
A red anywhere is a red everywhere (meaning by sacrifice. I've been trying to get that saying to catch on).

33) Cuc: S Y2 Cuc
D R1 Cuc G3 G3b
M G1 R2a G3b
	Cuc: I didn't forget that, but then I realized I'd have to keep a Red AND another Large ship in my HW (I'd rather not waste my Reds). Not too efficient in this case. In any case, I agree with you about the rules. I'm desperately trying to get a Large extra somewhere. But it seems I'm a bit cornered right now. Also, your Large Reds can be sacrificed to produce 3 attacks. And soon, you'll just flood my HW sacrificing the Large Yellows? I think I'm doomed, as I am not developing fast enough.
	Cuc: "but I could wear down their willpower". I thought I was devious by confusing them by suggesting a SS-name that really isn't what it says it is, such as R3A for a G1A (if I didn't even have a G1-system), and then creating a G1B calling it R1A, etc. ESPECIALLY if they got used to the "convenience" of naming them thus. Funny. Well, I'll stay with sportsmanship . . .

34) Babamots: Move Y3 Orion G3b
	Cuc: Thx for the remarks on the UNDO button. I'll make some notes in review of this game so I won't forget those details. This game is certainly a success, as I've survived until now!

35) Cuc: B R1 Cuc

36) Babamots: Sacrifice Y3 Orion
Move B3 Orion G3b
Move B3 G3b Cuc
Move Y3 G3b Cuc
	Cuc: I made a mistake (fooled myself), so sometimes I just need to UNDO, I guess, to correct a typo. I'd better be quick, before you respond :-).
	Babamots: You hit undo before I got the page loaded. You're lucky I'm at the doctor and have bad reception. At home, I might have won the race. :-)
	Cuc: Another question: what do you use for time settings, I chose 4/6/13, so that I'd get a response in 1 week, or win in 2 weeks (that's how I read it.) But perhaps there is a convention you propose, especially for the tournament? 
	Cuc: Of course, you're much faster than that, I now realize, but sometimes for me, days may pass that I can't look at the game, or it will be at an odd time for you. Also, I wouldn't like to play under pressure, and a week is VERY comfy for me. That's because most weeks have a similar activity pattern . . .

37) Cuc: A Y3 Cuc
	Babamots: I'm not sure I understand what you've said about the 4/6/13 setting. You you have 2 weeks to win, but it's more like you have two weeks (13 days) to move. That setting means players start with 4 days on their individual clocks and 6 days are added each time one of them moves up to a maximum of 13 days.
 
I've settled on 7/2/7 as my preferred clock setting. It's rare for me to need more than 2 days to move, and maxing the clock at 7 days means that I always feel compelled to make a move after about 4 days (half my timer), no matter how busy I am or how reluctant I am to continue in a game that I'm losing.
	Cuc: I guess I'm missing what the last setting means. I seem to remember that if your opponent doesn't respond by that time, you may consider it a win? Perhaps it is related to "hard/soft time". I'm still new at this, and I was a bit overwhelmed by the detail here.
	Cuc: Dang, I see I could've eradicated most of your Yellow. Oh well. I was so concerned about denying you the Large Green.

38) Babamots: Sacrifice R3 Orion
Attack R3 Cuc
Attack Y3 Cuc
Attack R1 Cuc
	Babamots: If the details won't be too much, I'll give a fuller explanation of the timers later. My move will have to wait too as I have a work party to attend. There's supposed to be pizza, so it should be OK :-).
	Cuc: Sounds good. Have fun!

	Cuc: I practically am breathing out my last air. Perhaps you'd consider blowing up Blue in Cuc?
	Babamots: I'm afraid I can't settle for catastrophe here. Red-powered invasions are my preferred path to victory.
	Babamots: Pretty good. Want to try another one?
	Cuc: It's been great practicing. N this game I don't understand why I couldn't build what I wanted. You did something tricky perhaps, meaning advanced strategy?
	Cuc: Ah, you caught me there. I was hoping to lash out with my 3R once B was gone. Nothing to a veteran of your caliber . . .
 
Sure, I'll play another. But please be patient. I'll set it up tomorrow by the end of the day. Thx.
Any explanations? 
Do you have a strategy guide?
	Babamots: I've issued a challenge for whenever you're ready.
 
Since you didn't have access to blue, I was able to use blue as a shortcut to getting large pieces of other colors. I think the best thing you could have done different was to, at some point, trade your original large ship for a b3 so that you could also build larger ships.
 
Here's my strategy guide:
 
====
The most important questions
====
 
"If I did nothing this turn, what would my opponent's best move be?"
"If I make this move that I am considering, what will my opponent's best move be?"
 
====
After your opponent moves
====
 
Identify what objective(s) they were trying to accomplish
* Was it a "victory?" Did they just get what they wanted?
* Or was it a "setup?" Is there something they want that they got closer to?
    - If it is a setup, can you spoil it?
    - Or can you predict what their next move will and get a head start on reacting to it?
    - Or is it safe to work on a plan of your own while they build toward their goal?
* Or was it a retreat? Were they just reacting to your last move?
 
SOME MOVES CAN BE MULTI-PURPOSE. After you see one purpose to your opponent's move, look for more.
 
====
Will your move leave a desirable piece available for your opponent to build?
====
Are you building the last ship of that size?
Are you discovering a system marker with the last pieces of that size?
Are you abandoning a system? Will they want the marker?
Are you trading a ship? Will they get the old piece?
Are you sacrificing a ship? Will they build it?
Are you causing a catastrophe? Will they want the pieces?
If your opponent has a medium or large green, can they sacrifice it to skip past a size in the bank and get a larger size than you could?
 
====
Specific things that are tiresome to constantly consider but neglect will cost you games
====
 
Identify every catastrophe your opponent could possibly cause
* Yellow sacrifices provide extreme mobility. Check twice.
 
What if your opponent attempted an all-in homeworld attack right now?
* If they were to start moving all their ships into your home as quickly as possible, what would happen?
* Could you attack the ships as quickly as they arrived?
* Could there be a catastrophe that you wouldn't have time to prevent?
* If their attack would just barely fail, what more do they need to make it succeed?
 
What if YOU were to attempt an all-in homeworld attack right now?
* What more do you need to make it succeed?
 
====
Red flags
====
 
Here are BAD situations.
Things high on the list are worst.
I need to avoid these things (unless I can make something even worse happen to my opponent).
Contrariwise, it's good if my opponent has one of these problems.
 
1.  I have no ships in my home and I lose the game (worst thing that can happen).
2.  My opponent has more ships in my home system than I can capture in one turn, even by sacrificing my largest red.
3.  One of my home system markers is destroyed.
4.  I don't have a large ship in my home system.
5.  There is a near-catastrophe (three pieces) involving my ships (or the marker for a system where I have ships).
6.  My opponent has a red ship (anywhere) and I do not.
7.  My opponent has more large ships than me.
8.  My opponent has more yellow ships than me.
9.  My opponent has a ship in the same system as me and it's bigger than my ships there.
10. My only large ship in my home system is the same color as one (or more!) ships or markers in my home.
11. The ship(s) in my home system are all the same color (even worse if I also have a home system marker of that color).

Other thoughts
====
 
Homeworlds is a game where it's easy to charge ahead with your own plans while ignoring what your opponent is up to until it's too late. That's why these tips focus on making sure you look at what your opponent is working on. Choosing a goal and taking little steps toward it is easy. Figuring out your opponent's plans takes work.
