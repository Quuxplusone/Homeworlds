	wil: Hmmm nice start.... Shoulda took fortress I suppose

10) wil: B G2 B2
	MobyNostromo: Fortress has a red, right? Im still not experienced enough to really understand the initial setups. Ive been using the same one. 

11) MobyNostromo: B G2 Mobynostromo
	wil:  No banker is a one and a two PIP star, fortress is a three PIP and two pip a star .. 
	MobyNostromo: I see. Thanks! (Sorry about the delay.)

12) wil: Build G3 B2
	wil: Fortress because ones are often taken early and then in short supply when your opponent is trying to build an avenue in.   Banker because you can send greens out to queen stars and sacrifice green later and grow the star someplace else...your investment gets paid off.  large and small star system is called goldilocks...because not the other two...

	wil: I don't know how to see moves ahead... So many ways to thwart plans.... I have plans, strategy, begin with the end in mind, only a few ways to win, I work toward any one of them...

36) wil: Sacrifice R2 Wil
Attack Y2 Mobynostromo
Attack Y2 Jollygreen
	MobyNostromo: You play Chess, yes?
	wil: I did...until I found this...  now rarely chess, working on coverting chess players to this..or identify folks who might be interested based on chess.  But I don't 'see moves ahead' there either...I look for where I want to end...and then work my way thru to get there...like hiking to the next range...I look and try to head for a pass that I see.  And then head down to the valley and as I run into obstacles I keep turning back toward that place I am headed.

37) MobyNostromo: B Y1 Emerald
	MobyNostromo: I know what you mean. I've played this about twenty or so times and still feel like there is so much more that I cannot yet see. I used to play Chess casually, and I appreciate that game and its depth, but there are other games that are even deeper and more interesting.
 
And your description of your thinking process makes a lot of sense. I remember reading this one strategy book on Chess that described the two kinds of planning in that game: the tactics and the fuzzy thinking that involved where you would like to be by a certain time.

	wil: I was left with a choice sack and attack or grow and catastrophe...almost got creative!!   Gg, challenge me anytime!  (Note, for my first 50 -100 games I didn't challenge to win.. I challenged to lose and learn)
	MobyNostromo: Thanks, Wil. I know that the better the game, the longer it takes to master it.
