	mneme: I believe it is time to make an end to this.

	mneme: thanks for the game!
	nycavri: Still never won a real game here on SDG . . .
	mneme: How do you define "real game"?  Or do you mean "real game of Binary Homeworlds?"  It's a pretty hard game, very inelastic in terms of skill/victory.

	nycavri: I mean that, technically, I've won two games on SDG, but both were against 100% first timers who literally didn't know what they were doing.
 
I understand that the competition here is very stiff - the fact is, I win more than I lose face to face - but it can get frustrating.  I don't feel that I'm especially bad, just the locals are especially good!
 
I guess now I know how people feel playing me at Penguin Soccer . . .
 
*grin*
	mneme: Ah, gotcha, yeah.  I -never- beat TwoShort, but do reasonably well against everyone else (I think I'm a little better than zoltar; not sure who else is up in the top echeon)
	mneme: If we found one another at the NYC thing, I suppose I could try to help you with that "winning in person" thing too.  :P  FWIW, my livejournal has a decent pic: http://mnemex.livejournal.com
	mneme: Oh, right, Andy.  I lose to Andy too, though I may have gotten better than the last time I played him.
