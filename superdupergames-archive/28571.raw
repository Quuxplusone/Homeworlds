	Simon: Flat-out oversight. gg!
	endo: Good game! The position after move 9 was pretty crazy. "s y3 g2, m y2 g2 clique, m y2 clique endo, c endo y, m b1 r2 endo" would have been enough to win, I think, but if I understand it correctly, SDG doesn't allow taking actions after declaring catastrophes. I had to check the sources to make sure but was busy with real-life matters, that's why it took me so long. :)
	Simon: Right, catastrophe and then normal moves is forbidden here, which is the older version of the rules. Is the site open source?
	endo: There's a copy of the source from 2014 available in the author's Google Drive at https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Bw8J0V9P_9hMeEJUSXE1LXRBN00. I'm not sure if it's completely up to date.
	Simon: Cool, thanks.
