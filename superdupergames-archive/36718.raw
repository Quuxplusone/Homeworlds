	Simon: Instead of build y2, there was a wild line with sac g3, build y2, b2, b3 elsewehere, and spend 2-3 turns without a home queen. To punish, enemy y1 or y3 would have to be sacced in reply, making obsolete their recent moving.
 
I rejected that line because was too hard to calculate whether there was a forced loss. The position isn't that terrible.

	Draw5PlayAll: Thanks for the game.
	Draw5PlayAll: (I'm not sure how you could have defended as soon as I got the two larges in range. I think you would have had to blow up the Y3s, but my red pump probably would have stolen the larges again.)
