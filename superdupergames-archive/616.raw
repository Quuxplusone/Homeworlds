jesse: Well, here's tip number one: The two most important colors to have access to in the early game are yellow and green. Green is necessary to increase your fleet. Yellow is necessary to disperse your fleet and stay safe from overpopulations. Blue is also important for the same reason, and to keep your fleet flexible. (Notice that I can't afford to build any more yellow ships until I move some out, or change their color.) Having your yellow ships (as opposed to planets) is more important than having blue ships because yellow is more useful to sacrifice. Red is only important once the two fleets are near to coming in contact with each other.

jesse: Now that you are mobile, there is a rule of thumb that when your opponent picks up a gun, you must pick up a gun. Therefore, I now follow you into the red economy.
jesse: On the other hand, to really put your big gun to use, you would have to violate another key principle: Never leave your homeworld undefended.
jesse: It is possible at times ignore either of these principles, but you do so at your own peril.
