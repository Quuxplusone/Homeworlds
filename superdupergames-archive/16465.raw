	bhorner: It never seems like the right moment to make a blue...  I'm sure this will be my downfall somehow.
	bhorner: *seemed...

15) bhorner: Discover Y1 Stumpy G2 Toolate
	TwoShort: I think turn 1 was the only right moment.  Not that it would have made for a great opening, but that was the last time you could flip the three, grow a blue, and flip back or move out before I could get a y2 and throw in another for the catastrophe.  I also think this will be your downfall, but I know how :)

	bhorner: Can you give me a gauge on how far ahead of me you think you are?  Is it like 60-40, or worse?  I can't see anything obviously threatening me...  are you just building up material for a big strike?
	TwoShort: Big pieces are much more valuable than little ones.  My super-crude rule of thumb is 2s are worth 3 1s, 3s are worth 3 2s.  So by that, I'm up about 2-to-1.  That's subject to a lot of exceptions for position details of course.  But in this case, I've got the blue engine going that will keep getting me more big pieces.  I'm not threatening directly now, but that's how most games go; barring a big blunder by the opponent, the winner usually gets there by getting control of more/better material, building up until the actual attack is unstoppable.  I may threaten you shortly, but mostly to force you to deal with it rather than building.  Until I can get all the way to victory, if I can expand my 3 pointer advantage, that's the top priority.

	TwoShort: Red Alert.
	TwoShort:   So I typed that because "Red Alert" is the traditional warning to newer players meaning I have a crushing move next turn if you don't do something about it.  But now that I'm looking at it more, I don't think you can do anything about it.
  I feel a little guilty in that the fast blue monopoly opening I used is a bit of a special case response to someone taking a small blue as part of a 1-2 homeworld as first player.  It's hard to deal with, and doesn't necessarily teach you much about the more general game, so sometimes I don't do it vs. new players; but this time I was in a bit of a rush and didn't check how much you'd played...  Anyhow, I hope it wasn't too demoralizing :) 
  I'll be happy to play a more instructive game anytime; just don't take a b1 star :)
	bhorner: I bet this will hold you off for a move.  :)
