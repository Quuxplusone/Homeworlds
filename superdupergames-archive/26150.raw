	wil: Do I get to get beat by the winner or loser?
	TeeTeeTee: I'll accept a challenge after this game, if you like... but I think it might be more appropriate for you to wait a bit and not make a ladder challenge, this time. You've avoided being challenged on the ladder before by immediately re-challenging someone as soon as you've lost a game, so nobody lower down on the ladder ever has the opportunity to play you: I only got the chance to challenge you once before due to a glitch in the system.
 
Also, please ask peterh58 if the Thirsty Meeples has a pyramid set. :P
