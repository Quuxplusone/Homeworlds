	wyons: you just departed from game 11066.. :)
	TwoShort: That's funny.  Taking the b1 was the other move I was considering, but I recalled I had tried some tricky/agressive move early last time and it hadn't worked out, so I decided to play it a little safer.  I had no (conscious) idea it was exactly the same decision though.

12) wyons: Build B1 Wyons
	wyons: well we will have to see if the early tricky/aggressive pays off for me....

	wyons: I nearly gave myself a cerebal haemorrage looking at this lot and I do not really know if this is the best option. But time is running out. I also think you have me beat.
	TwoShort: Hmmm, I am feeling better about it than I was a few moves ago.  But it feels like a festival of ways to screw up...

30) wyons: Trade B1 Y1 Trueblue

31) TwoShort: Build Y3 Twoshort
	wyons: I think I became unhinged when I made the r2 ship. I had missed you could safely create a b2 in your homeworld. Now it is damage control but I think you have a compelling advantage.
	TwoShort: The red you haven't been able to seriously threaten me with yet may have been a mistake.  As to overall advantage, I guess the view depends on where you sit :)  That last move may have been damage control to you, but it looks like a crushing reversal to me.  I'll be happy to come out of the next couple turns only slightly behind.

	TwoShort: So if you undid because you saw a better move, you'd have made it. So you must have undid because you saw some fatal flaw.  But I've looked at this until I gave up on finding something I could commit to at least twice, so how did I miss it?  Or maybe you undid as a clever psych-out strategy.  If that's it, it's working :)

42) wyons: Sacrifice G3 Wyons

	wyons: not a psycho-out strategy- nor did I see a better move. I thought I saw a fatal flaw- but this is such a complex situation I couldnt be sure even of that...

46) wyons: Discover Y3 Yonderboy G3 Xanthrophyl
	wyons: sadly work is so busy at present I have not had time to think this one through fully (lame excuse I know)
	TwoShort: Well, the last couple moves I've spent a long time trying to think them through, but in the end felt like it hadn't got me anywhere and I was just guessing :)  
	wyons: I think sooner or later- especially when there are this many pieces in play it starts to default to intuition  rather than logic. The trouble is without the logical analysis as well intuition isnt enough on its own....

	wyons: In early April I am off on holiday for a couple of weeks. If you havent beaten me by then do you know a way that we might suspend play for the period and would that be OK with you?  :)
	TwoShort: Actually, I'm off the week after next.  I've figured out how to freeze the clock in the past, so sometime before I go I'll figure it out again...

	TwoShort: I think if you type "~vote accept freeze" as a chat, that will do it.  I also beleive we can keep playing with the clock frozen.  I'm departing on Monday and coming back the following Monday...
	TwoShort: actually, maybe it's  "~vote accept clock freeze"
	wyons: as a matter of interest: how did you set up the clock freeze request? was it ~clock freeze   ?
	TwoShort: yes, that was it.  more to the point, what I remember each time is "search the wiki for 'freeze'"...
	wyons: thanks, and have a good holiday

54) wyons: Build G1 Trueblue
	TwoShort: I'm back from my vacation, but I guess you're just headed to yours.  In any case, feel free to thaw the clock whenever you are ready.
