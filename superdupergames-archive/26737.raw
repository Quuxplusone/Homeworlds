4) Sarthobi: Build G1 Sarthobi
	wil: a little faux pas in the opening....when you pick the same small for your star you leave an easy monopoly start...when I change my g1 for blue you'll be cornered out of blues...your fix before it gets to far will be after you grow g1 switch your g3 for b3 (unless i get two close with a b and can catastrophe)

This is as far as i've gotten with any game challange so far

	wil: Your crew have been anesthetized, your ship retrofitted for our use.  Send another transport ship and we'll have your crew loaded aboard for return to a neutral zone. 
	wil: attack is interesting...you can't move in and attack since it is turn based...the other guy can attack you if he is equal size and has the capability...  what I am working toward now, and I don't think you can stop because of my blue monopoly is.. you take one, I take three...  I send two big ships into your homeworld...you may be able to take one but with my Red Queen I'll be able to take that back and yours in the process...  so I'll sack my g3 again...for two more b3s then with my y3 send them in for the kill...

	wil: The monopoly is what killed you... When someone gets a color...insure you get that color (unless you are able to hold a simultaneous monopoly of another color...but that is fraught with peril) 
	Sarthobi: Thanks a lot for the game :)
Learned a few things hehe.
I'll finish some challanges and will try out some new ones later.
Good game!
	wil: I try to keep a half dozen to a dozen games going (since some folks take 3-7 days to play) challenge me anytime...  I lost probably 80% if my first few dozen games of homeworlds...but I love watching it..
