	Felix: Well I'll be more experimental with you in the future :)

12) wil: T G1 R1 B1
	wil: That would be to your benefit... My failure here is the same as chess...I don't have the patience, attention, or interest to take the time and look for the best move... I shoot from the hip, and often to my detriment.
	Felix: I often do the same when playing on here, actually. I'd be more inclined to strategize when playing in real life, but I often make moves on here while at work and can't afford more than a minute or two to think over my move.

	Felix: Beginning without blue is a difficult opening to pull off, but I'd love to experiment with it more myself and see if it's possible to turn it to an advantage. It's hard to see it as anything but a handicap right now...
	wil: It is fun to try things..  Make mistakes and learn...  Thx for the game!
