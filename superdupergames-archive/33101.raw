	dlwillson: Sorry for the delay, gents!

114) dlwillson: M G1 Northwest_sky Oscar
	Draw5PlayAll: I thought my R2@kermit was too vulnerable so I used it instead of the R1@B2. Also I keep a weapon at B2.
	Draw5PlayAll: Hey DLWillson, I am sending you a message... please read it before moving.

115) Draw5PlayAll: Sacrifice Y2 G2

Catastrophe Northwest_sky B
	Draw5PlayAll: Who, me? But ts52 is too big (he still has 5 larges to my 4) and you are too small.

118) Draw5PlayAll: Build Y1 Draw5playall
	dlwillson: No, TS52 should... I might have declined your offer of cooperation, if TS52 hadn't moved into my system. Had I been him, I would have attacked you and bet that I would not be able to capitalize on it. That still seems like the best play, to me. Either of you spending to hit me, is wasting pyramids or turns. Unless you can turn a profit, that is...

119) ts52: Build G1 Grover
	dlwillson: Since I can't win, I can afford to do silly things like that.
	Draw5PlayAll: I will start to discover some large systems.

120) dlwillson: Trade Y3 G3 Dlwillson
	Draw5PlayAll: But I do not 100% trust that you cannot win. If me and ts52 keep attacking each other that might give you enough time to build a legitimate fleet.

121) Draw5PlayAll: Move Y1 Draw5playall G2

122) ts52: Build G1 Ts52

123) dlwillson: Build G1 Dlwillson

124) Draw5PlayAll: Move G1 Draw5playall B2

125) ts52: Move G1 Ts52 Gonzo
	dlwillson: Draw5: You should cross the "dlwillson has a legitimate fleet" bridge when you come to it. ts52 is a much more immediate threat to you. Any turns or ships either of you spends on me... Well, you play your own game, but I will casually predict that the next player to attack me, will ultimately lose the game, because of the waste of time/material.

126) dlwillson: D G1 Dlwillson B1 Sky
	Draw5PlayAll: No, I meant that as me and Tim attack each other, you will get enough to become a threat... what will more likely happen is that I destroy Tim (or vice versa) and then have to defeat you. I will deal with you later, but you seem to be in the kingmaker position...

	ts52: Yeah, I've been struggling to stay alive. But I don't think I'll be able to much longer.
	ts52: Building the last 2 yellow only means they'll be destroyed in the next few turns, I think I might last longer returning a lot of green to the supply. And if not, at least I'll go out in a bang. ;)

	dlwillson: Good, fun game. Very political, as multi-player should be. Well done, all! Now, unless I miss my guess, this ends in two TS52 turns.
	ts52: Wow. That was a very interesting and unusual game. (I don't recall the last time I played a full game larger than 2 players.) Thanks everyone. That was fun!
	dlwillson: I missed my guess. :-)
