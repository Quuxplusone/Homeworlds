	anonfunc: Gotcha.  It's nice in person... the games run about 30-40 minutes for us, and there's some good heckling around mistakes.

7) wil: Build B1 Wil
	wil: I agree.... in person is great (and now you have a twist you missed, only growing ships you already have)  And playing with a chess clock you can make it a ten minute game and multiply the mistakes, increase the learning...
