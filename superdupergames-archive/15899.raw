	TwoShort: No hurry... but I'll note that I don't see a way for you to stop me from victory in 3.  
	dlwillson: Neither do I. Ah well. Why'd you ask about the location? Want to play with real plastic sometime?

	TwoShort: I'm always curious where online opponents are, and it's kind of neat to find one not all that far away.  I'm theoretically interested in playing in person some time, but practically, my schedule is often busy and I don't own a car :)   If you keep me apprised (directly or via the Icehouse mailing list) of the progress of this "Icehouse Games at Tacticon" concept, I'll most likely be there.

	dlwillson: Good game. Let me know if you want to come to my next Pyramid Party. I have another friend in Boulder, and I could ask him to pick you up.
	TwoShort: Thanks for the game.  As far as pyramid parties, I'd certainly like to hear of such things, just don't be offended if I can't make it :) It's as much a question of scheduling as transportation, as I have many time-consuming activities (notably, two children).
