	jonaskoelker: I forgot to play AGAIN? :(  Seems to happen a lot these days.  I'm sorry.

	captncavern: Well, you lost it, so it doesn't really matter to me ;)
If you care about the ratings, however, maybe Aaron can cancel this game...
	jonaskoelker: Nah, the ratings don't matter (that) much; it's more the fact that I can't seem to stick to playing homeworlds.  No need to cancel the game.  And why aren't you disappointed---did you play to win and not to play? :O ;-)
	captncavern: Oh... well, If you look at my rating for Homeworlds, you'll see that I'm not playing this game for the ratings ;) I love the game, but I really can't get my head around it.
 
I'm actually (a little) more serious about Ordo, with the tournament going on right now and a chance to get the game from Nestorgames :)
