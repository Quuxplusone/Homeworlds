9) wil: D Y1 Wil G3 G3
	Felix:  Oh, I do love jiffy pop! Didn't get any this time though. We used to go camping a lot, but it has been a little bit trickier with a baby and a puppy.

	wil: Taking the little ones camping is great stuff...   
	Felix: For sure. It's loads of fun, especially now that our daughter is old enough to actually know what's going on around her :P

	wil: My kids are 24..but when they were preteen they became great campers...they set up tents, the kitchen, cooked, cleaned, packed the containers and car...I didn't even have to say anything, they were super efficient.

	Felix: Ah, your kids aren't much younger than me! I'm 26. Didn't realize I was competing against an older and wiser fellow :) My strategies shall now change accordingly.

	wil: Lol, you are playing a 60 year old...that slept outside over 40 days last year, from minus 7 at standing rock to 102 at burning man...
	wil: I didn't have my kids till I was 36...

41) wil: A Y2 Rumpus
	Felix: I'm impressed! That's quite a temperature range. My impression was that this type of nerdy game generally appealed to a younger demographic, but I'm glad it has a broader appeal than I realized! How did you get into the game? You said you're friends with Andy Looney, right?
 
My dad was 55 when I was born... he's nearly 82 now. He started having kids around 38, I believe, so he beat you by a couple years!

	wil: This is chess but better... It will take time to catch on.... My daughter bought zendo when she was in third grade...nearly a decade later I was playing poker with john, korey and Andy....with the same pyramids as chips...and I learned the rest of the story.

	Felix: I agree. It will catch on, and I hope soon, since It's hard to find anyone willing to play outside of this website. I still haven't played much Zendo, but have enjoyed what I played! It's very cool that you have been along since the early days of the system.

	dlwillson: If either of you are in Colorado, I'll drive for a game.
	wil: How much would the 1st place prize have to be to get people to fly to a tourney.....hmmm

	Felix: I'd love to se Colorado, dlwillson. I'm in North Carolina, however :/ I'd love to do a tourney of some kind. I wondered if it was feasible to do one online. This game really needs to be implemented somewhere like BoardGameArena, which has a realtime system.

	wil: You two have any good games examples for he theater?   Classic bluebirds, or doomsdays, or freezeouts ....or just darn interesting games?  Kudos to submitting ones you lost by stupid mistakes.
	dlwillson: I'll pay $128 to be in a competitive tournament.

	dlwillson: The crushing defeat I just got from Draw5 is pretty interesting. Also, the small game Felix and I played was pretty interesting.
	Felix: The game I just lost to Ausmuh was fairly interesting. I did some really stupid (but unique) things, such as intentionally blowing up part of my homeworld in order to threaten a catastrophe in his. Didn't work out, but made for some interesting moments. I seem to recall that you and I had a pretty long and fascinating game not long ago too, Wil.
	Felix: Let's see... Game #32289 with Draw5PlayAll was pretty fascinating, since I managed to squeak out a win with an usual 2-2 homeworld star. If you're looking for a freezout... I managed a pretty decent yellow freeze against ts52 in game #32171. And my recent ladder defeat to dlwillson was pretty fascinating with me barely hanging onto half of a my homeworld while desperately trying to keep the blue out of his hands. That one may not be a good candidate though, because I resigned instead of playing it out.

	Felix: Or this game for a good example of a doomsday machine :) I was so focused on trying to get what I needed, I utterly failed to notice you setting up a nice apocalypse for me!

	Felix: Indeed.   Not my most situationally aware game ever. Well done and congratulations! 
	Felix: I have no idea why I didn't catastrophe on my last turn. That would have dragged things out a bit longer I suppose.
	Felix: Though only a turn or two at most, I think.
	wil: Lol yup, ids had to sack my y2 to get the r2 home which would have really looked like a bad ending with your r3 in my hw!
