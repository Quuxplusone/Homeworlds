Participants: Babamots (S), Cuc (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) Cuc: Homeworld B2 G1 Y3
	Babamots: I can give strategy tips as we go if you like.

2) Babamots: Homeworld B3 G1 G3 *
	Cuc: I'd love to "listen in" on your considerations. I play Hex with a friend of mine and then he elaborates on his strategy. There is no guarantee I'll win by listening in, but I will learn about the considerations he makes. To get closer to the level of equal analysis skill is quite exciting.
On Thursday I learned something from self-play. Even if you can't move 3 ships at once to your opponent's HW, you can start with 1. Then, the only thing your opponent can do to avert overpopulation is conquer. But then in your follow up move, you move in 2 other ships of the same color with overpopulation as a result. From this I got the question if causing a catastrophe in your OWN HW could be less devastating as it sounds? (In certain circumstances.) Have you ever won a game in which you caused a catastrophe in your own Homeworld?
This game has the potential to become more interesting than I already thought it was.
	Cuc: (By the way, my friend is a chess master, and he is also VERY good at Hex, so he always takes a handicap. He analyses his own moves, not mine . . . )
	Babamots: I'm pretty sure I have won a game where I caused a catastrophe in my own home (including destroying my own star), but I don't remember when. I should make a web-crawler to download all of my game histories for easier analysis.

3) Cuc: Build Y1 Cuc
	Babamots: I was just looking at an old game and saw a question I didn't respond to. Analogkid's graph image library is here:

If you play a game with him, he'll send a link to an updated version (if he has made any changes).
 
Here is my graph image library:

Compared to Analogkid's, mine is smaller and only for simple graphs, but the styles are consistent and it has subdirectories to keep it a little more organized.

4) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots

5) Cuc: B Y1 Cuc
	Cuc: Thx for the info on graph zendo. I'll keep analogkid in mind.
	Cuc: You are excluding me from swapping for green, temporarily.
	Cuc: My keyboard was NOT cooperating. I was typing that you are excluding me from swapping for green, temporarily.
	Cuc: Hi, I'm recognizing a pattern

6) Babamots: Trade G3 Y3 Babamots
	Cuc: Hi -> Hm
	Cuc: I'm thinking that I could've t y3 b3 and then s g3 b y1 cuc b y1 cuc by2 cuc, to exclude you from yellow?

7) Cuc: T Y3 B3 Cuc
	Babamots: You can usually dodge these early freeze-outs by trading your large ship.

8) Babamots: Build G2 Babamots

9) Cuc: Build B1 Cuc
	Cuc: My keyboard does not seem to cooperate. Twice I wanted a G3, and twice I got a B3. Oh well.
	Cuc: But yes, I see how that works with swapping the Large.

10) Babamots: Discover G1 Babamots G2 Orion

11) Cuc: D Y1 Cuc B3 B3a

12) Babamots: Build G2 Orion

13) Cuc: D Y1 Cuc G3 G3a

14) Babamots: Build G3 Babamots
	Cuc: I realized that a g3 in my HW would be a liability. So rather than get stuck I moved forward and took the last b3. It doesn't hinder you too much, though. Your moves have the tendency to reduce my options considerably.

15) Cuc: S Y1 B3a
D B1 Cuc G3 G3b

16) Babamots: Trade G3 R3 Babamots
	Babamots: Limiting your good options is of course my intention.
 
Increasingly, I have been understanding the early game as a competition to determine which color gets its small pieces exhausted first and who is best able to build that color. I was able to make green run out of smalls first and make it difficult for you to get green ships, so I'm building mediums ahead of you. I can trade those mediums later to jump into the red or blue economy, even if you use up all of those smalls.

17) Cuc: T B1 R1 G3b

18) Babamots: Build G3 Babamots

19) Cuc: B R1 G3b

20) Babamots: Trade G3 B3 Babamots
	Babamots: So I've got the Red Hulk setup, as it happens. You need to trade for a red right away, but it doesn't need to be b3 for r3. You would be safe enough for now by trading for an r1 in g3b. That's what I was trying to communicate about your "Red Hulk" comments earlier. Perfect example here in our game :-).
	Cuc: I wondered how I can prevent you from growing more Green or any other color, so I turned the last G3 int a star.
	Cuc: Yes, I see the threat. I'm still wondering if a r1 isn't too little of a defense. After all, I can only sacrifice it once. Ah! But when I conquer your R3 in my HW (if ever), I'll have a large red . . . 
	Cuc: I'll follow your advice, but I wish I could build some yellow first. No time, I guess . . .

21) Cuc: T B3 G3 Cuc
	Cuc: Since you traded in your g3, you're probably going to build it back somewhere?

22) Babamots: Build Y1 Babamots
	Cuc: Now you have a factory. You can sacrifice g3, build it back and have 2 more build actions. You are able to create an army of yellow, red (and keep green). Then you can trade in a large red, say for a large yellow and start a doomsday machine. You excluded me somehow from medium and large ships and I can't seem to do anything about it. 
I could build yellow or red in one of my b3a/b systems one small at a time, but I can't create enough material to stop your growing army.

23) Cuc: B Y1 G3a
	Babamots: Yes, I'm afraid you're pretty doomed. Looking back, my suggestion to trade for a g3 came one turn too late. You needed to do it on your 3rd turn (just before I mentioned it).
 
On your 3rd turn, you could have built another green ship, and on your 4th turn, that ship could have been moved to a new system (to get rid of the dangerous 3-matching-greens in your home).
 
As it went, on your fourth turn, your could have traded for a large green, but it wouldn't have been safe to use it to build any additional greens in your home. That's because your g3, system marker, and other green ship would all be green, and I could sacrifice my y3 to move my g1 to your home, destroying it all and putting you way behind.
 
However, starting on your 4th move, you could have gotten into the green economy safely (but slowly) like this:
 
trade y3 g3 Cuc
discover g3 Cuc y3 Y3A
build g2 Y3A
move g3 Y3A Cuc
 
The first person I remember seeing use this technique was wil. He traded his large for a color he needed access to, moved it tout of his home system to avoid building up to a 3-match, and built the coveted color there.
 
You have Draw5PlayAll to thank for teaching me the instafreeze I've been using. D5 likes it so much that he has been known to pass the first turn. Notice that it only works for the second player, and the first player needs to use a small green or blue star in their home (theoretically, you could do it with yellow too, but I've never seen it tried). A small red is the safest small star if you're going first.

24) Babamots: Build Y2 Babamots
	Cuc: I actually considered that maneuver you suggested. The reason I didn't was that I seemed it too slow. But in hindsight, I see it's necessary.

25) Cuc: M Y1 G3a Cuc

26) Babamots: Move Y1 Babamots Orion

27) Cuc: B Y2 Cuc
	Cuc: Also I noticed, like you said, it works as a second player. Included is the choice of HW to take out a crucial small as a star. So I've been considering that a defense might be to build a HW having 2 pieces of the same color (can't have 3 pieces of same color unless blue, but that defeats the purpose).
	Cuc: Great analysis! I'm a bit ambitious right now. After more than a decade, I think there is more knowledge than just guidelines. So, here is proof. A whole tactical opening strategy to get ahead. Also, we're seeing a diversity of endgame tactics. Most impressive I find how I was excluded from the next size up. It's a tempo disadvantage. But if I don't take the last one of that size, I'm also getting behind by just moving pieces around that are fine where they are.

28) Babamots: Move G2 Orion G3b
	Babamots: Making a home system with two stars of the same color is definitely bad. Your opponent would only have to move two ships of that color into your home in order to destroy you with one catastrophe.

29) Cuc: T G3 R3 Cuc

30) Babamots: Sacrifice R3 Babamots
Attack R1 G3b
Attack R1 G3b
Pass

31) Cuc: T Y1 B1 Cuc

32) Babamots: Build G3 Babamots

33) Cuc: B Y1 G3a
	Babamots: This move is meant as a double threat. I can attack both of your r1 ships (leaving you with no red ships) or I can move two greens into your home to destroy your only large ship and a home star.

34) Babamots: Sacrifice G3 Babamots
Build B1 Babamots
Build R1 G3b
Build G3 G3b

35) Cuc: Build Y2 Cuc
	Draw5PlayAll: I noticed you mentioned my liking of the insta-freeze setup. I tried to do it once with yellow, but the lack of any blue in my setup proved my undoing. (I needed to get at least some red, but that requires going to a blue system, so I can't build yellow there, which slows me down.)
 
Then again, instafreezing blue or green requires an extra move to trade for yellow...

36) Babamots: Sacrifice Y2 Babamots
Move R1 G3b Cuc
Move R1 G3b Cuc

37) Cuc: Trade Y2 R2 Cuc

38) Babamots: Sacrifice Y1 Orion
Move G3 G3b Cuc

39) Cuc: Trade B1 R1 Cuc

40) Babamots: Sacrifice R1 G3b
Attack R1 Cuc

41) Cuc: Build Y1 Cuc

42) Babamots: Trade B3 R3 Babamots

43) Cuc: Build Y2 Cuc
	Babamots: Looks like you might have forgotten about catastrophes. Either of us can trigger them at any time on our turn.

44) Babamots: Sacrifice R3 Babamots
Attack Y2 Cuc
Attack Y2 Cuc
Attack Y1 Cuc
	Cuc: Let's see what happens next.

	Babamots: GG! I will of course release the captive crews of those ships. ;-)
	Cuc: thx!
	Cuc: I'm going for another game!
