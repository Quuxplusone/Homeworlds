1) dragon76n: Homeworld G3 B2 Y3

2) wil: Homeworld Y3 B1 G3
	dragon76n: Hello Wil, I'm new to Homeworlds. I just read the rules of the game today on http://www.looneylabs.com/rules/homeworlds and was hoping to find an open game here that would be willing to show me the ropes. 
	wil: I'm glad to help...just about my favorite game!  So now openings, folks think banker is best, you took fortress so I'll take goldilocks...

3) dragon76n: Build Y1 Dragon76n
	wil: Having a green star in your homeworld makes it hard to have a factory later..as you can't have one there...reduces opportunity.

4) wil: Build G1 Wil
	dragon76n: Ok. Thanks for the tip about The Factory. I'll try to keep that in mind for the future. 

5) dragon76n: Trade Y1 B1 Dragon76n
	wil: Are you a chess player?  What is your favorite game?
	dragon76n: I play chess once in a while. My favorite game is Conquest of the Empire, but it is tough for me to find people who will play. I play Dominion and Settlers of Catan the most with my wife and son.

6) wil: Trade G1 B1 Wil
	dragon76n: At this point I'm not even sure how I should be expanding. I'm just trying to read over the instructions to try to grasp the basic ideas, so any tips you're willing to give a "Junior Officer" is much appreciated, even if they don't come until after you are in position to destroy me. 
	wil: You've picked perfectly...the shortest stack...tis the game to get to the big pieces...

7) dragon76n: Build B2 Dragon76n
	wil: You are first working to build a variety of ships for use later, to build new outposts with protection and diversity
	wil: Begin with the end in mind...there are two ways to win... take over the ships in the other homeworld or destroy the stars...

8) wil: Build B2 Wil

9) dragon76n: Trade B2 Y2 Dragon76n

10) wil: Trade B1 R1 Wil
	dragon76n: Is it common for players to build up a lot at the homeworld before moving away to another star? 

11) dragon76n: Trade Y3 R3 Dragon76n
	wil: nah...sometimes build two and move one...or you may simply move one straight out...depends

12) wil: Discover B2 Wil G2 G2
	dragon76n: Based on what I was reading in the rules, bigger yellow ships seem to be able to move further than smaller ones, but I didn't see anything in the "Move" section that would confirm that. 
	wil: they don't...sacking a y3 allows you 3 moves with other ships...like sacrificing a r2 allows you to attack two ships and sacking a g1 build one, sacking a b3 changing the colors of 3 ships...

13) dragon76n: Discover Y2 Dragon76n Y1 Yellone
	dragon76n: Ok. Thanks for the clarification. 

14) wil: Build R1 Wil

15) dragon76n: Build B1 Dragon76n

16) wil: Build B2 G2
	dragon76n: I guess I just tried a couple illegal plays, trying to build ships that I couldn't.
	wil: you must have one of the ships in the star system you want to build... it is like you need an example to build another one...

17) dragon76n: Move Y2 Yellone Dragon76n
	wil: If you are confused...don't hesitate to ask questions...right there taking the last blue pawn, you opened up blue drones for me...and in the safety of you not being able to build another without a catastrophe

18) wil: Trade B2 Y2 G2
	dragon76n: Ok. Thanks again. Is it possible for you to get to my Homeworld in one turn if there is no connecting star? For example, if you had a Y3 ship that you Sacrifice, would it allow you to do a discovery with one ship and then move past there with another? I don't think that's allowed since each "pip" only allows one ship from the current star to move to the next star, right? 
	wil: yes and no...the star system is created momentarily for you to land and then disappears again after you leave it.   
 
s y3 hw
m g1 hw existingstar
d g1 existingstar newstar
m g1 newstar opponentHW

19) dragon76n: Discover B1 Dragon76n G1 Greeone
	wil: and now suddenly your question is appropriate!

20) wil: Build R1 Wil
	dragon76n: So a Sacrifice doesn't have to be applied at the same location?
	wil: No...once you sac something you provide that power (trade, build, attack, move) anywhere on the board to any piece regardless of its color or the color of its star system, tis galaxy wide (for your ships)

21) dragon76n: Build R2 Dragon76n

22) wil: Move R1 Wil G2
	dragon76n: Ok. Thanks for the info. I'm glad to be playing against you for my first game. Too many times I've tried playing games online with people who have no tolerance for new players. I tried playing some stuff on VASSAL last week... a game that I know the rules to but didn't know how to play in using that program, but I was told to leave in a rather rude manner. And it wasn't my first experience like that. 
	wil: humans...
	wil: and I missed my moment by one move...I shoulda moved in on your new star with my ship...you wouldn't sac a 3 for one kill and I would have had it....

23) dragon76n: Move R2 Dragon76n Greeone

24) wil: Trade R1 Y1 Wil
	dragon76n: Ahh... I think I'm now realizing why even having small red ships would be nice, since you've pointed out that I "wouldn't sac a 3 for one kill." Those little red ones can just sit back like long range missiles. 
	wil: zactly, inter galactic star wars protection...lazer accuracy

25) dragon76n: Build Y1 Dragon76n

26) wil: Build G1 Wil
	dragon76n: Sorry, I thought I had submitted the orders for my turn yesterday. 

27) dragon76n: Move Y1 Dragon76n Greeone
	wil: no worries..

28) wil: Discover G1 Wil Y2 Y2

29) dragon76n: Build B2 Greeone

30) wil: Build B3 G2

31) dragon76n: Move R2 Greeone Y2

32) wil: Trade B3 Y3 G2
	wil: do you know about overpopulation?  that you can cause an environmental catastrophe by having 4 of any one color in a star system?  That if I sac my y2 in g2 I can send a blue thru greeone into your homeworld and catastrophe all your blues?  Which would include half your homeworld star?  
	wil: I'll wait till you decide to make a different move before I go.
	wil: tell me if you wish to keep this move..
	dragon76n: I read about catastrophe before, but didn't notice you were in range to do out. I will accept the consequences if you choose to do that. 
	wil: no...if you didn't know you can always back up...I've got no choice to go forward and do that...this is your chance, the learning game...next time I won't be so nice (note so much changes when you move...when we play live we move a coin or something when we are done..because you really need to look to see how the board changes...you legitimately get  a reprieve on this one...
	dragon76n: Ok. Thanks. I'll adjust my move. 

33) dragon76n: Attack G1 Y2
	dragon76n: Ok. I think I'm set now. Do players get the option to take back their turn every time? I don't see an option to do it now. I only see an option to Resign up where I saw the option to undo my move before. Not that I'm trying to take back this move, I'm just wondering if it's possible. 
	wil: you can back up one move at a time...  each move allows run redo...but not two...  in real life you can try as much as you want...until you move the coin

Catastrophe Dragon76n R

	dragon76n: Yep... I realized that I have no movement after I sent in my attack. I was hoping that it would be worth the sacrifice but I'm wondering about that now. 
	wil: good game... I look forward to the next!
	wil: the issue is one color in your homeworld leaves you open for the blue bird (simply eliminating that color through catastrophe)...
	dragon76n: Oh wow... I saw that you were probably going to eliminate the red ships from my homeworld. I had forgotten about that causing an immediate loss. Good game. 
	wil: Can't run your fleet if you have no leaders left at  home
