	hellajoey: Are you enjoying this game, Jake? You got a little whirlwinded in your first just like I did in my first 2. That will pass though. I think there's probably about 3 or 4 games worth of concepts to get acquainted with. Anyway, hope it's enjoyable enough for you. Also, I'm mostly just testing out this message feature right now ;)
	abridged: I feel like I'm getting the hang of the rules. They're still not fully internalized -- e.g. I just tried to create a blue ship, and then realized I couldn't -- but I'm getting there. I'm definitely enjoying it. I got creamed in game 1, but it was clear at various points what mistakes I'd made, which always makes me want to play more.

	hellajoey: By the by, it was noticed in my last game that if a person activates the "take back move" option there is some strange behavior that it's tempting to imagine is a glitch with the interface: the opponent is presented with a pair of buttons that seem to allow either of forced victory or a forced end of game. Jared and I decided on a gentleman's agreement to just never click either of these buttons. I'd like to make the same arrangement with you if you're down :)
