	Babamots: consider discovering a y2 with the r2 in Babamots in preparation for sacrificing g3 to build all remaining yellow
he can't build all the yellow without letting you catastrophe

	Babamots: My parents' visit is over, so hopefully I can play at a more normal pace.
 
So when I broadcast my knee-jerk move four days ago, I just wanted to make sure that, when I had time to study it properly, I kept that one in mind. Now that I've looked around, I think it still looks good. Sorry you had to wait for almost no reason.
	Felix: No problem! I know all your plans now! :D I don't utilize the notes area enough, myself.

	Felix: Huh, I didn't know we could do that. I don't mind, but I wish I had known during my game with speardane. I would not have timed out if I knew I could freeze it. Maybe I can get a rematch? :)
	Felix: Ah, I see that it's in the rules. I guess I didn't read them carefully enough. Oh well, I suppose that's my loss.

	Babamots: Too bad we're not playing with last year's simultaneous elimination rules or I'd've had a draw back there!
 
Well, I don't feel any particular need to play this out. My last hope was that you'd be oblivious to a red catastrophe at home, but you don't miss things often. Congratulations, and maybe I'll get you next time!
	Felix: Thanks! It was a good game. I'm sure you'll get me next time. We're pretty evenly matched, but small momentum changes can still build up over time into large advantages.
 
I actually spotted the double elim earlier and made sure I re-read the rules again before I chose to not guard against that :) I honestly was feeling pretty nervous leaving my two reds at home like that for so long, thinking I had overlooked something! Good game.
