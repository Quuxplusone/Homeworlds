	Laurie_Menke: Hi shoejitsu... I just wanted to let you and w00t know that I'm making a list of games to ask Aaron to end due to abandonment.  I know you are both currently active on SDG right now, but this game seems abandoned, so I am going to include it on the list unless one of you says not to in the next 24 hours.  I hope that's the right thing to do.  :)
