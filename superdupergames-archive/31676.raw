	wil: You left g1 home alone..
	bhorner: Did I have some better move?  You could just have moved in your y3 last move instead of building r3.  :). My only hope was boldness and flustering you (which I didn't actually count on).  Now I will take the pretend 2nd place and pound of flesh of half your homeworld.  :). gg

	bhorner: I think I said something you didn't do...  But the result is the same.  :)
	wil: What... That old place?  We found this lovely new star with growth potential... It appears abandoned...just a few indigenous we can easily enslave.
	wil: Feel free to challenge anytime... I like paying
