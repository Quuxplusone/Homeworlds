Winner: rootbier

1) bootdisk: Homeworld B1 G2 Y3
	bootdisk: incidentally i forgot the rules seth... -.- gimme a few days. my semester has going into its third week and it's beginning to become stressy. don't expect me to think a lot about this :P

2) rootbier: Homeworld Y1 B3 G3

3) bootdisk: Discover Y3 Bootdisk R3 R31
	bootdisk: d'oh!
this happens if you don't read the rules again - after a long time. for a moment i wondered what kind of strange view-mode it is that hides my homeworld :P
 
uhm.. rematch?
	rootbier: oops there. it shouldn't actually let you finish yourself but i guess they didn't code suicide prevention into it. i have a standing challenge out there. you can use it to start a new game any time you like.
