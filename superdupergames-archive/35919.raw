Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2020.1.28, Ended: 2020.2.7
Participants: Babamots (S), capi3101 (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) capi3101: Homeworld B1 Y3 G3
	capi3101: Howdy. Just realized I wasn't playing anybody - still need the practice...

2) Babamots: Homeworld B3 R1 G3

3) capi3101: B G1 Capi3101
	Babamots: I was just running low on games and put a standing challenge. Thanks for the game!
 
Did we play a training game a couple of months ago? If so, would you still like hints?
	capi3101: We did, and I still suck at the game so hints would be welcome...

4) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots

5) capi3101: Trade G1 B1 Capi3101
	Babamots: A few thoughts on the setup:
 
Very important: it's a small universe. We're both connected to medium systems, so our homes are only two moves away from each other.
 
Since I had a red star, it's easier for you to get lots of red ships than it is for me. That could be your shortcut to getting medium and large ships faster than I do.
 
On the other hand, I'd like to get lots of yellow, both because it's my usual strategy and because your yellow star will slow down your yellow production (a little). If I focus on yellow, my yellow-building may be slower-going (compared to your red) since there an r1 has already be used up.
	capi3101: Any particular reason why you chose to go with a small map?

6) Babamots: Trade G1 B1 Babamots
	Babamots: I think the game may be more instructive this way. Small maps are a little simpler, so I think it's easier to make plans and harder to make mistakes.

7) capi3101: B B2 Capi3101

8) Babamots: Build B2 Babamots

9) capi3101: Discover B2 Capi3101 Y2 Aleph

10) Babamots: Trade B1 Y1 Babamots
	capi3101: Programming note - I tend to use the Hebrew alphabet for naming stars. Change of pace from the standard Greek. Doesn't really matter of course...

11) capi3101: Build G1 Capi3101

12) Babamots: Build Y1 Babamots

13) capi3101: Trade B1 Y1 Capi3101
	capi3101: So far this is going as I thought it might. How big of a danger am I currently in of getting completely locked out of yellow?
	capi3101: I assume since I have access to blue in two different sizes I'm okay-ish at least.
	Babamots: You have a medium blue, so you'll be able to join the yellow race at the medium level. But you'll have to move it to another system in order to build more, and I've already got a two-ship head start. Unless you get started now, there's definitely a danger of me running away with so much of the yellow that you can't set up good attacks.

14) Babamots: Build Y2 Babamots

15) capi3101: Discover Y1 Capi3101 G2 Bet
	Babamots: Notice that it's not safe to build yellow at your home. You'll need a new system.
	capi3101: That put a kink in my plans - I had intended to move the small yellow up to Aleph, but if I do that now you could sac the y2, move in your two y1s and blow the star. You'd be the worse off for the exchange I think but you'd then be ahead on ship-buiding. Correct assessment?
	Babamots: Moving your y1 to Aleph doesn't do much for you since your building options would remain the same (you can only build green unless you sacrifice to build blue). If you move your y1 to Aleph, I won't bother causing a catastrophe. I would lose my valuable yellows (which I can spread out and possibly get a near-monopoly) whereas you would just lose two ships, each of which needs to move somewhere else before it can accomplish much.
	Babamots: You need to get your yellow to a new green system so you can compete for yellow ships a little. You should probably also slow down my yellow domination by letting the Aleph star go back to the bank.
	Babamots: On my turn, I will probably discover a new system with one of my yellows. If the bank remains unaltered, I could then potentially sacrifice my g3 to build all remaining yellow pieces (I would then have three at home and three in the new system).
 
By discovering a new g2 system with your y1, you prepare to build yellow yourself and simultaneously threaten to catastrophe the yellow ships in my home. It will force me to spread out more before I sacrifice-build. That gives you a turn in which to either
 
1) build a y2 (probably not the best since it makes it easier for me to get the y3) or
 
2) plug up the bank by moving away from Aleph (maybe to a y3 system, which would reduce the number of y3 I can get).
	capi3101: Makes sense.
 
Hey, could you send me a link to your strategy guide again? You had it on Facebook a couple of weeks back as I recall. I was going to copy down the link but never did for reasons...

16) Babamots: Discover Y1 Babamots G2 Risa
	Babamots: Here's the index to everything:
 
https://jpeterbaker.github.io/homeworlds/site/index.html

17) capi3101: Discover B2 Aleph Y3 Gimel

18) Babamots: Discover Y1 Babamots B2 Bolarus

19) capi3101: Build Y2 Bet
	capi3101: Okay. So your next move is likely to be a sac of the big green to clean out the remaining yellows. That gives you two yellows at each world and a big one at that.
	capi3101: My options to at least stymie you - I can't stop it entirely - are to either discover a big yellow star with the small yellow at Bet, or to grow a medium yellow there and at least give myself another ship.
	capi3101: Leaning towards growing. I do see a developing threat to my homeworld but I think I've got some time before you trigger it.
	capi3101: On the other hand, you can't make a triple move if you don't have a large yellow...
	capi3101: And with the board as small as it is, perhaps discovering is the better option.
	Babamots: Building y2 is pretty safe for you right now.
	capi3101: Oh good. I had had the thought that if I did get the y3 out of circ you probably wouldn't do the green sac altogether (for now), since you wouldn't be able to replace it right away.

20) Babamots: Build Y2 Babamots
	Babamots: Right, I could spend one large to get a different large, but it would reduce my ship diversity (no more green).

21) capi3101: Discover Y1 Bet Y3 Dalet
	capi3101: ..and now would be the time to get that last yellow out of circulation, right? You could build it easily at Risa and have an independent big ship at your disposal.
 
My option is to claim it with one of the ships at Bet. Building it at Bet would be dumb. Swapping my large at my homeworld for it would be immeasurably worse.

22) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots

23) capi3101: Trade G1 B1 Capi3101
	Babamots: Those y3s could be good investments for you if you can get a green there. My plan is to work on red next. You can't build anywhere now, so trading your g1 for red or maybe even blue is probably best for you.
	capi3101: I was leaning towards blue - get that out to Bet since it's the only frontline system I've got. Maybe go ahead and try to get that system happy in the longer term.

24) Babamots: Move B2 Babamots Risa
	capi3101: Wil's stomped me enough times to drill the importance of blue into my head already...

25) capi3101: Build G1 Capi3101

26) Babamots: Trade G1 R1 Babamots

27) capi3101: Trade G1 R1 Capi3101

28) Babamots: Move R1 Babamots Risa
	capi3101: Building green instead of swapping the blue for red might've cost me there.
	capi3101: I still lost the initiative on red, methinks.
	capi3101: Here, have a medium.
	capi3101: ...or not. Okay. That might've been a better play than I originally thought.
	Babamots: You started on red later, but since I have a red home star, I'm slowed down by a turn (I can't build another red right now, for example).

29) capi3101: Build R2 Capi3101
	capi3101: (Insert quip about how Risa is happy now here).

30) Babamots: Build R2 Risa

31) capi3101: Move R2 Capi3101 Bet

32) Babamots: Move R2 Risa Dalet

33) capi3101: Sacrifice Y1 Dalet
Move B1 Capi3101 Bet

34) Babamots: Build Y1 Risa

35) capi3101: Discover R2 Bet B3 Hey
	capi3101: That wasn't to my benefit, was it? You still get the small yellow if that was your goal, but this way you get to put it where you want.
	capi3101: Now I've got a definite threat sequence to my yellow star in progress...
	capi3101: m y1 capi3101; then s y2 babamots, m y1 risa capi3101, m y1 Bolarus capi3101, c capi3101 y.
	capi3101: I need to get the rest of blue out of circulation.
	capi3101: A better move for me would've been to discover a new star with the small yellow. Probably a small green star. 
	capi3101: Well, too late now...

36) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots
	capi3101: Going to be cleaning my house today and tomorrow; probably am not going to be on to play very much in that time period. Just letting you know.
	Babamots: No problem.
 
We've been playing keep-away so aggressively that we still don't have large ships to spare. It's kind of cramped, but it makes for an interesting game.

37) capi3101: Build G1 Capi3101
	capi3101: Was going to do b g1 capi3101 but I think you and I have the same idea with that last move...and you'd get there first.
	capi3101: Well, maybe not.

38) Babamots: Sacrifice G3 Babamots
Build R2 Dalet
Build R3 Dalet
Build R3 Risa

39) capi3101: Sacrifice G3 Capi3101
Build B1 Gimel
Build B3 Bet
Build R3 Capi3101

40) Babamots: Move R3 Risa Babamots
	Babamots: This isn't a very safe move for me since I'm leaving my home without a large, opening up a large for you, and putting three of my reds together. You should probably build the other r3, but a catastrophe on my reds isn't a totally dumb option.
 
I'm not sure how I should respond to either action, but it's such an interesting position I couldn't resist.
	Babamots: You shouldn't sacrifice y2 to invade me right away since I can counter-invade and capture all of your home ships before you can get all of mine.
	Babamots: In other words, don't move your g3 to my home right now.
	Babamots: The problem with the first "interesting" move I made and undid was that it left Risa without a medium ship. I was going to get to build a y3, but you could invade Risa and take my only red before I could exploit it. I wanted to do it because the position was interesting, but I decided it was too bad of a move.
	capi3101: Ugh...this is a bad idea......

41) capi3101: Move R1 Capi3101 Bet
	Babamots: Oh cool! I wasn't thinking of that. Good one.

42) Babamots: Sacrifice B2 Risa
Trade R2 B2 Dalet
Trade R3 G3 Dalet
	Babamots: You've got me a little twisted around now. I need to defend pretty carefully.
	Babamots: You have enough material for a slow doomsday machine:
 
https://jpeterbaker.github.io/homeworlds/site/tactics.html
 
I think your challenge will be to push all of the pieces at me without opening up an opportunity for me to cause a catastrophe.

43) capi3101: Build R2 Bet
	capi3101: Really? And here I thought I was in trouble...
	capi3101: I might need to get the red ship from Hey for that to work. I could do that by sacking my sole y2, but that kind of locks that move into the final one of the set.  
	capi3101: I think I see a sequence that ~might~ do the trick though. Going to depend on your responses.

44) Babamots: Build R3 Risa
	Babamots: I definitely think you're ahead. I might let you try to figure it out rather than helping you beat me :-)

45) capi3101: M R1 Bet Babamots
	Babamots: You can tell I'm flustered when I undo a lot. Sorry about that.

46) Babamots: Trade R3 G3 Babamots
	capi3101: K. Here goes nothing.

47) capi3101: B R3 Bet

48) Babamots: Attack R1 Babamots

49) capi3101: Move R2 Bet Babamots

50) Babamots: Sacrifice R1 Babamots
Attack R2 Babamots

51) capi3101: B R1 Bet

52) Babamots: Discover R2 Babamots G2 Orion

53) capi3101: Move B1 Bet Babamots

54) Babamots: Attack B1 Babamots
	Babamots: After that, I think the tables have turned. I may have time to disrupt your plans.
 
The guide I liked you to has a warning about one-ship-at-a-time red catastrophes, but I guess you didn't see that part.
	capi3101: Saw it, but I have yet to be beaten over the head with it as yet. Have now. Crap.

55) capi3101: Move B3 Bet Babamots
	Babamots: I've never forgotten that trick after I lost to it for the first time.

56) Babamots: Attack B3 Babamots
	capi3101: Ever have a game where every piece made it out of the bank before?
	capi3101: Asking out of curiosity.
	capi3101: I've been away from work since Friday and I was tracking the board state with my origami set I've got out there. Required quite the update today...
	capi3101: Commence bad idea #2. Probably more than #2 but I've lost count...

57) capi3101: Sacrifice Y2 Bet
Move B1 Gimel Bet
Move B1 Bet Babamots
Catastrophe Babamots B
	Babamots: I clearly remember two games where the bank got exhausted. There may have been more.
 
I tried for an hour to make an origami piece, but I couldn't match up the text descriptions of how to fold with the blurry picture. :-|

58) Babamots: Move R3 Risa Capi3101
	capi3101: Been meaning to do a video of the origami pieces. Big problem is that I don't have an overhead camera rig...

59) capi3101: Attack R3 Capi3101

60) Babamots: Sacrifice Y2 Babamots
Move R1 Risa Capi3101
Move R2 Orion Capi3101
Catastrophe Capi3101 R

61) capi3101: S B2 Gimel
T R2 Y2 Hey
T R3 Y3 Bet
	capi3101: Well, there's that...
	capi3101: ...but I think now I'm hosed.
	capi3101: Actually, I do have a plan - question is whether I've got time to pull it off.
	capi3101: I'm guessing I don't.

62) Babamots: Sacrifice Y2 Babamots
Move G3 Dalet Bolarus
Move G3 Bolarus Capi3101
	capi3101: ...ah, I don't. Damn.

63) capi3101: M Y3 Bet Capi3101
	Babamots: No, but it was very close. In fact I think this may be my only way out. It took me a while to realize that offense was the best defense here.

64) Babamots: Sacrifice R2 Dalet
Attack G1 Capi3101
Attack Y3 Capi3101
	capi3101: Yeah, I saw it coming. I think Im going to fall one move short. Ill still play it out.

	Babamots: Here's the archive view for easy reference:
 
http://www.superdupergames.org/main.html?page=archive_play&gid=35919
 
I've got a meeting, but I'll be back to talk about woulda coulda shouldas.
	Babamots: Like the guide says, you usually can't cause a red catastrophe one ship a time. You needed to spend your y2 on the red catastrophe. Assuming you hit red first, you would then need yellow of some kind in order to move in your blue ships. That could be arranged in the way you noticed (converting your yellow star into a ship using blue sacrifice).
 
I think your big chance was when I messed up on my 22nd move. I left you with an opportunity to catastrophe my reds right away. If I had been careful enough to not have a red ship matching my star, you would have had to fiddle around to get a third red on my doorstep without leaving your home undefended.
 
On your 23rd move, I think you should have sacrificed the y2 to move both red ships from Bet to my home for the catastrophe.
 
After that, I suspect you should
 
discover b2 Gimel r2 Waw
 
(I would probably probably build y2 to keep it away from you. I don't have to defend my home with a large yet since you don't have a way to get a large there)
 
sacrifice b1 Gimel
trade b3 y3 Bet
 
(Even though you need your blues for the catastrophe, don't trade your home r3 for y3. I could catastrophe it and then invade your home with a large before you could react.)
 
At this point, I really need to keep the blues away from you, but since you have yellow again, I also really need to defend my home with a large. But I don't have physical pieces in front of me at the moment so I'm in danger of misanalysis. I'll say more later.
	Babamots: We really need to get some position exploration software so that we can display what we're talking about :-).
	capi3101: Indeed.
	Babamots: Are you following my long trains of thought? I'll write up the rest of my position analysis if you say you'll follow along.
	capi3101: I'll follow along with it as best I can.  
	Babamots: In my last attempt at analysis, it looked like I was going to be able to find a win for you starting from your 23rd move. But now I see that I skipped my own turn right off the bat, so the rest of what I said is nonsense.
 
After lots of examination, I've decided that mostly what your fleet needed for victory was another large ship to guard your assembling death fleet, but you also need another yellow ship (an size). So now I think your real opportunity was on your 24th move. I had just traded away my g3, so you can build r3.
 
I'm going to list the moves that you could make to create a death fleet that would also keep your ships pretty safe (no three ships of the same color, no ships left alone without a large). I think this plan could be adapted to answer anything I could have done to stop you, but it would be complicated to explore it all and write about it. It seems good enough show you an example of maneuvering your ships with relative safety.
 
build r3 capi3103
 
move b2 Gimel Bolarus
(depending on how I respond, you should get to either sacrifice a red to attack the y1 in Bolarus or sacrifice the b1 in Gimel to trade for a y3. I'll assume that my y1 runs away so you get to sacrifice and trade).
 
sacrifice b1 Gimel
trade r3 y3 capi3101
 
move y3 capi3101 Bolarus
 
move b2 Bolarus Babamots
(I probably attack the b2)
 
move b3 Bet Babamots
(I must attack the b3 or you will sacrifice r3 to attack most of the ships in my home, thus there are two blue ships in my home)
 
move b1 Bet Babamots
catastrophe Babamots b
(notice that no yellow sacrifices were needed for the blue catastrophe)
 
sacrifice y2 Bet
move r2 Hey Bet
move r2 Bet Babamots
(there can't be a red-star-destroying catastrophe at my home without at least one yellow sacrifice. Two of the reds you need to use are two moves away from my home, so using two sacrifices saves time)
 
sacrifice y3 Bolarus
move r2 Bet Babamots
move r3 capi3101 Bet
move r3 Bet Babamots
catastrophe Babamots r
 
My most likely counter-attacks are to move one of my largest to either Gimel, Hey, or Bolarus at a moment when you don't have a large there. But then you could move a large to whichever system I took mine out of to attack some of my ships. Like I said, I'm not positive how it would all go down, but that's a direction you might have tried.
