1) wil: Homeworld Y3 B1 G3

2) Takvorian: Homeworld R1 B2 G3
	wil: thx for the game.
	Takvorian: my first ever game of Homworlds...

3) wil: Build G1 Wil
	wil: That is a near perfect opening response...do you want me to walk you through stuff I see as we go?

4) Takvorian: Build G1 Takvorian
	Takvorian: Yes, that would be very helpful! This game is really different from all that I played before, I have no clue what to do...
If my English sounds a bit strange to you - I am from Berlin Germany, so it's not my native language.
Thanks for your help!

5) wil: T G1 R1 Wil
	wil: No worries .. Where chest is a land based war game this is a inter inter galactic war game the colors of your ships and stars indicate what powers you have
	wil: typically you want to make sure you don't get isolated out of any economy / color...

6) Takvorian: Trade G1 Y1 Takvorian

7) wil: B R1 Wil
	Takvorian: ok, so I tried to diversify my colors...
	wil: True,  but to show you what happens I'll go for a red monopoly 


8) Takvorian: Build Y1 Takvorian

9) wil: B R2 Wil
	Takvorian: Just discovered that my small red star, doesn't help to buil a red ship...
	wil: Exactly.... Picture it like you need a template of the other color to retrofit / trade it was not for another 

10) Takvorian: Build Y1 Takvorian

11) wil: Discover R2 Wil B2 B2
	Takvorian: Am I already doomed?

12) Takvorian: Discover Y1 Takvorian R3 Cygnus-x1
	wil: nah...well maybe...as you'll have work to figure out how to get back out of this mess...but even if you were...it will be educational to see how powerful this is, and how it plays out... yellow and blue monopolies are the worst in my opinion...but any monopoly can be disastrous.

13) wil: Discover R1 Wil R2 R2
	Takvorian: To be honest, I have no real plan for this game yet.
I suppose you need many games under your belt, before things click.
	wil: lol...yeah I lost dozens in different ways before I saw the attacks coming...two ways to win...take over all the ships in the homeworld or blow up the stars..

14) Takvorian: Build Y2 Takvorian

15) wil: Sacrifice G3 Wil
Build R2 B2
Build R3 B2
Build R3 Wil

16) Takvorian: Discover Y1 Takvorian B3 Aldebaran
	wil: Sacrificing...by sacrificing any ship anywhere you transmit the power throughout your armada... be it attacking, building, trading, or moving...by the strength (pip number) on that sacrificed ship...hence my sacrificing a g3 allowed me three grows.

17) wil: T R3 Y3 B2

18) Takvorian: Build Y2 Takvorian

19) wil: T R3 G3 Wil
	Takvorian: I feel completely clueless in this game...
	wil: It'll take you less than 10 games... 

20) Takvorian: Move Y2 Takvorian Aldebaran
	wil: It'll take you less than 10 games... Watch for catastrophe.... 4 of any color in one star system will move all of that color back to the bank... Including the star 

21) wil: Build R3 Wil
	Takvorian: I don't know, I think I'll need around 50...
So far, I have no strategy. Because I have no access to red ships, I don't have an idea how I could harm you in any way. And it seems that you can easily overtake my two systems...
But I checked the rankings and saw that you are one of the strongest Homeworld players here.
Perhaps we can play an unranked teaching game hereafter where you can tell me the ideas behind your moves.
The game itself looks very promising to me, if I could only wrap my head around...

22) Takvorian: Trade G3 R3 Takvorian

23) wil: T R2 G2 B2

24) Takvorian: Trade Y2 R2 Aldebaran

25) wil: B Y2 B2

26) Takvorian: Trade Y1 G1 Takvorian
	wil: you did good on grabbing that r3to stop the monopoly. but now you have no greens can't grow.

27) wil: D Y2 B2 B3 B3
	Takvorian: So I have green again, but still don't know what to do ;)
	wil: Always look at how to end the game and build the ships required to do it

28) Takvorian: Move G1 Takvorian Cygnus-x1
	wil: It is about moving a force in range and of the numbers needed 
	wil: It is about moving a force in range and of the numbers needed 
	wil: It is about moving a force in range and of the numbers needed 

29) wil: Build G1 B2

30) Takvorian: Discover Y1 Cygnus-x1 Y2 Ertrus

31) wil: S G2 B2
B Y1 B2
B Y3 B3
	wil: There is a building stage, an arms race, there are only a limited number of pieces in the bank.  That morphs into a positioning stage, protecting and taking territory in space as you are working toward their homeworld.  Skirmishes of attacks and catastrophes.  Here is where it beats the crap out of chess... you don't destroy pieces if you can help it...when you attack you take over the ship...these are multitrillion dollar intragalactic crafts which carry upto thousands of people from one star system to another...you surely don't want to destroy that...   and then the way catastrophied or sacrificed pieces can come back into play... the universe can reboot over and over as this happens.  until someone goes in for the kill...building a doomsday machine, or taking advantage of a bluebird.

32) Takvorian: Move R2 Aldebaran Ertrus

33) wil: Move R2 B2 Aldebaran
	Takvorian: That is really a lot of stuff to consider, and I even don't know what doomsday machine and bluebird means ;)
I can't remember that I was ever so clueless, the depth of this game must be similar to Go.

34) Takvorian: Sacrifice G1 Cygnus-x1
Build R3 Ertrus

35) wil: Sacrifice Y3 B3
Move R1 R2 Aldebaran
Move R1 Aldebaran Takvorian
Move R2 Aldebaran Takvorian
Catastrophe Takvorian R

36) Takvorian: Trade Y2 G2 Takvorian
	wil: You'll get the handle of it...  It is a great game for having set up in the house...with a move coin going back and forth from side to side and everytime you or you wife moves as you walk by you see it...and then make your move and move the coin...  I've played numerous games with roomates this way. (as for definitions)  http://www.looneylabs.com/rules/homeworlds 
	wil: four colors, three sizes of pieces... so much variation...  yes like GO...simple rules, tons of strategy
	Takvorian: great idea setting up a game at home. Unfortunately we have some cats and because of that game positions would probably change while absent from the table...;)

37) wil: Move R3 Wil Takvorian
	wil: cat moves are part of the game..

38) Takvorian: Move R2 Ertrus B3
	Takvorian: That was quite a hit!
I think my days are counted (I don't know if this is also an English proverb).

39) wil: Attack G2 Takvorian
	wil: You got it!  We call it "My days are numbered"
	wil: You are in trouble...but you wanna watch the end play out.
	wil: I said that before looking at the board...yeah...you needed to sacrifice the y2 for two moves to get your big red gun back home to protect the remaining star... it is over..

	Takvorian: Thanks for the instructive game. Perhaps I learned a few things...
But comparing to the alphabet, now I know A, B and perhaps C, but all the other letters are well behind my horizon;)
	wil: imagine how long chess took... in less than ten games you'll be beating some folks\
