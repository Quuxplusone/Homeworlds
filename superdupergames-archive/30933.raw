3) dragonlord: Homeworld R3 G2 Y3 *
	alexhouston: yeah my first time playing w 4 people
	alexhouston: yeah my first time playing w 4 people
	Draw5PlayAll: So, we are going to have 2 players with the same homeworld star pattern. That, or someone chooses two same-sized stars.
 
Then again, I am not sure what happens to dragonlord. He was inactive.
	Draw5PlayAll: Wait, so I am not sure how the turn order works. I think all uppercase names are first and then lowercase names, in alphabetical order. This is a flaw.
