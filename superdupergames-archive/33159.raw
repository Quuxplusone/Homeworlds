26) dlwillson: Discover Y1 Dlwillson B1 Sea
	Felix: This has been an oddly symmetrical game so far.

27) Felix: Move R2 Out Sea
	dlwillson: I think that's going to change soon. Somewhere in the next three turns, or four at most. The bank is running too low for all this peaceful copy-catting to continue much longer.

Move G1 Sky Linter
Move G2 Sky Linter
Move G3 Sky Linter
Catastrophe Linter G
	dlwillson: That is not what you were supposed to do.

45) Felix: Trade B1 R1 Out

46) dlwillson: Attack R2 Dlwillson
	Felix: Sorry for the delayed undo. Realized I made a grave mistake!
	Draw5PlayAll: How?
	dlwillson: <sigh> Now, I have to *think*. Dangit.

47) Felix: Move Y3 Out Field
	dlwillson: I'm not sure that was correct, but it sure was fun.

48) dlwillson: Trade R2 Y2 Field
	Felix: It has certainly set back my doomsday machinations!

49) Felix: Move R1 Out Field

50) dlwillson: Sacrifice G3 Dlwillson
Build Y1 Field
Build Y1 Field
Build Y3 Dlwillson
Catastrophe Field Y
	Felix: This will be more difficult than I hoped. You're not behaving!

51) Felix: Attack B1 Field

52) dlwillson: Move R2 Dlwillson Field

53) Felix: Build R2 Field
	dlwillson: And I'm pretty sure that was wrong. But it was fun, too. I'll just keep making fun, wrong moves until one of us wins. :-)

54) dlwillson: Attack R2 Field
	Felix: I like your style! Your wild flailing is really setting back my plans :P

55) Felix: Build R3 Field
Catastrophe Field Red
	dlwillson: I have successfully stopped your first wave, and am now shooing your kids off my lawn!

56) dlwillson: Trade Y3 G3 Dlwillson
	Felix: Aw, nuts. I knew I shouldn't have let that red catastrophe sit for so long. Well played.

57) Felix: Build B1 Field

58) dlwillson: Build B2 Krimbus

59) Felix: Trade Y3 G3 Felix
	dlwillson: That's one of Wil's puzzlers! What is the correct response?
1) Build an r3
2) Capture the r2
3) Something else
And why?

60) dlwillson: Trade B2 Y2 Krimbus

61) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	Felix: I almost always build R3s when I can :)

62) dlwillson: B Y1 Dlwillson
	dlwillson: In my position, attacking your r2 was better, because it encouraged you to build the r3, which gave me the first "free" move. I'm still not out of danger. *LOTS* of Northern kids still on my lawns.

63) Felix: S Y2 Out
M B1 Field Dlwillson
M B1 Field Dlwillson

67) Felix: S Y2 Out
M R1 Sea Dlwillson
Pass
	Felix: Blah. This sure isn't turning out how I hoped, though. When did you nearly monopolize yellow while I wasn't looking?

68) dlwillson: B B1 Krimbus
	dlwillson: That took a lot of thinking! I finally decided to go with denial, but at a very high cost.

69) Felix: T B1 R1 Dlwillson

70) dlwillson: Discover Y2 Dlwillson B1 Sea
	Felix: Stop foiling my plans!

71) Felix: Sacrifice G1 Felix
Build R2 Dlwillson
Catastrophe Dlwillson Red
	dlwillson: Stop making plans that are so hard to foil oh, so that I can begin to make plans of my own. And then you can foil my plans instead!
	dlwillson: Speech-to-text is pretty good but not perfect yet.

72) dlwillson: Sacrifice B3 Krimbus
Trade G3 R3 Dlwillson
Trade Y1 G1 Also
Trade Y1 G1 Sky
	dlwillson: What is the protocol around captures in the home system? We have the relatively common situation where we can endlessly capture the same piece back and forth. I generally avoid capturing any piece my opponent can capture back, but we're now in the situation where it matters more than a little.

73) Felix: T B1 R1 Dlwillson

74) dlwillson: Attack R1 Dlwillson
	Felix: Hmm, I generally try to find creative alternatives when possible so those repetitive situations don't occur!

75) Felix: Pass

76) dlwillson: Trade B2 Y2 Krimbus
	Felix: You deflected my attack so well. Where did all my material go? :(

77) Felix: T G3 R3 Felix
	dlwillson: I was thinking you'd trade an r1 for a g1 at dlwillson last turn, then when I swapped b3 to r3, you'd build something (the big blue?) and have four at dlwillson, and I probably wouldn't be able to recover.

78) dlwillson: Build B1 Krimbus
	Felix: Huh. I didn't even think of that. But what would have stopped you from just attacking my g1 at that point without trading for the r3?
	Felix: Oh, do you mean after I catastrophed red?
	Felix: I've made a lot of mistakes during this attack run, and you defended insanely well. Great game!

79) Felix: T R3 Y3 Felix

80) dlwillson: T B1 R1 Krimbus

	Felix: If I think there's a chance my opponent could still make a mistake, I tend to prefer playing it out. But there's no hope for me now. Very well played. I admit I thought I had you and am a bit stunned at how you undermined my every approach with the doomsday devices. One for the books. You deserve that top slot!
	dlwillson: Thanks! Hard fought game! I thought I was going to get you with yellow way back when. Then, I saw the doomsday machine and had to burn half my fleet to stop it! Excellent game.
	dlwillson: It would be cool if Andy and John theatered this.
	Draw5PlayAll: If you want that, do them a favor and always call your systems Altair, Betelgeuse, Caster, etc in future games.
	dlwillson: That matters? If it does, I'll do it, but I had a system, already with Field and Forest, Sea and Sky, Golden and Sol, and ... Um ... Mars and something.
	Felix: It doesn't matter. They just sub those system names in automatically when they prepare a transcript of the game, from what I've been told.
	wil: It is a large matter of cut and pasting and editing...  eliminating the chatter... find and replace the system names globally as well as the names of the players...  If we find a game we'd like to see them try...  A game name and description of what would be of interest (frontal attack, bluebird, universe reboots, monopolizing economies etc.)  I am sure they'd really appreciate editing.
