14) TwoShort: Trade Y2 R2 Twoshort
	TwoShort: Yes!  Well, sort of: Keith Baker and I are old friends and a long time ago we would both have thought of 'Grogar' as a giant green monster; add some years and some free-associating to get 'Grogar' the monstrous teddy bear in his mind and 'Grogar' the green star name in mine...

15) rootbier: Discover R2 Rootbier G3 Popsicle
	rootbier: Rad 'nuff.
 
I have to say it's a really pretty game and a great mechanic (stacking the clear cards) - but I don't get a lot of (re)play out of it.
 
You guys used to crawl/campaign together? Or?
Are you also a designer/writer?
Do you have a BGG account? Link me so I can check your collection :P :D
	TwoShort: Keith and I have been best friends since we met in college..let's see...20 years ago!?!  Yikes! I'm old!  We've mostly lived in the same cities since, until he moved a couple months ago :(
 
Anyway:
 -Gloom is fun, but not exactly my thing either. I go more for the gear-headed: recent game-night favorites are Dominion and Small World.
 -Professionally, I'm a software engineer.  I've got a play-tester credit on Gloom, and probably some D&D stuff, but that's about the extent of my game career.
 - No BGG account, but my collection is easily described:  Many Icehouse pyramids.  One of everything else by Looney Labs.  A random assortment of stuff that didn't fit in Keiths car when he moved :)
 
So how did you come across Homeworlds?  It shouldn't, but it still surprises me when people I don't know play Icehouse games. :)
	rootbier: First time I encountered pyramids was err... 8 years ago(?)... playing Zendo with a best friend's kind-of-brother-in-law and his geekforce. Kind of got sucked into gaming properly a couple years ago - hanging out with this German chick at the international student village we were living in (I've been studying in Norway for the last three years).
 
I hear good things about Small World but haven't gotten to play it yet. I only get to play things I buy - which means --- things I bought last summer when I was back home for the first time. Even still it's mostly been just a lot of Carcassonne - which is fun but --- I wish my friends here were a bit more willing to mix it up.
 
Anyway - one of the things I brought back here with me was 5 Treehouse/Icehouse sets. So I've been trying to spread a bit of homeworlds to other folks. ... I should be studying for tomorrow's exam. :/

16) TwoShort: Build Y2 Twoshort

17) rootbier: Discover R1 Rootbier B3 Aubergine
	rootbier: I was studying for the wrong exam -- genius. I think I still probably pulled off a C without having read a page. Which is considered fine here - not by my standards but by the country's. I am switching programs anyway - so I am not too bothered. Though I imagine I could have aced it had I checked to see which one was coming.
 
Extra bonus: I won't have to study much for the one that happens next week.
