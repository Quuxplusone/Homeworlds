	Babamots: I didn't anticipate that nice move, so I need to make sure I don't rush into anything.
 
What I'm considering seems likely to result in an endless cycle. What do you do if a ladder game gets stuck? Should we just see who runs out of patience and resigns?
	Draw5PlayAll: Sorry for barging in, but:
 
On other ladders, if the game ends in a draw, neither player moves. Since that is effectively the same as the challenger losing, whoever issued this challenge (i.e. whoever is lower on the ladder) should resign if they can't win.
	Babamots: I thought that might be the case. I'll resign if we get stuck.
	Simon: I agree with both of you: For the ladder, resign of the lower-rung player feels in spirit like a draw according the ladder rules: "Draws are simply ignored." For rating points, it would be more appropriate for North seat to resign in a cycle because of North's unrealized first-move advantage.
 
Repetition of position should really become part of the Homeworld rules!
	Simon: (If repetition ever becomes a Homeworlds rule, I'm undecided whether repetition should be forbidden or whether n-fold repetition should be a draw claimable by any player. Delicate.)
	Babamots: For regular games, you can use console commands to make the game unrated after the fact. Now I wonder if that would work for ladder games too.
	Babamots: I'm traveling for the next 24 hours or so, but after that I should have time to look at this properly.
	Draw5PlayAll: 1. I think n-fold repetition should be claimable by the players, but admittedly there are lots of variables (i.e. three of each piece, abandon and rediscover a system, etc) that can make it much more difficult than chess to decide if a position is repeated.
2. The rumor is that in ladder games you can only freeze and thaw the clocks.
