Homeworlds Online (SDG# 34284)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2018.7.10, Ended: 2018.8.29
Participants: Babamots (S), MagicJohn (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) MagicJohn: Homeworld Y1 B2 G3
	MagicJohn: I'm not all that new to the game but my learning curve needs a kick-start. Think I may need some better tactics and a general game-plan going in.

2) Babamots: Homeworld B3 R1 G3

3) MagicJohn: Build G1 Magicjohn
	Babamots: I recently switched back to preferring a red home star (compared to yellow). It seems like, whenever I have yellow at home, there's a point in the game where I can't build the yellow I want because it would set up a catastrophe.

4) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots
	MagicJohn: How much work do you put in to avoid giving up the first #2 ship during early building?

5) MagicJohn: Discover G1 Magicjohn B3 Shelob
	Babamots: Depends a lot on whether I'll get the second one right after and whether my opponent will get the next one after that. I usually work pretty hard to keep my opponent from getting larges though.
	Babamots: On this occasion, I think you should not open up the g2 yet. Spread out and diversify.
	MagicJohn: So, if I move my G1 and discover a B3 I can switch colors on the next turn...Is the line reasonable? Seems a bit like developing one's pieces in chess. At this point in the game and based on the colors and sizes of ships and stars, are there certain strategies that I should start to consider or is it still mostly tactical? 
	Babamots: If you discover now, you should probably plan to build in the new system before trading there. Otherwise you'll have no green for more construction. I am likely to trade away my g1, so building green in you new system will be safe (not give me a chance to get medium).
	Babamots: So to answer your question directly, yes that line is reasonable, but it leaves a red or yellow ship in your new system with no way to build. You'll need to send another green there if you want to make more.
	MagicJohn: Discover g1 magicjohn b3 Shelob 

6) Babamots: Trade G1 Y1 Babamots

7) MagicJohn: Build G1 Shelob

8) Babamots: Build Y1 Babamots
	Babamots: Before giving advice, I should have looked more closely at what my actual response to your move would be. You didn't get a yellow ship while there were small ones available, and I have the chance to freeze you out. To get yellow, you'll have to wait until you have a medium ship you can trade for a y2.

9) MagicJohn: Trade G1 B1 Shelob
	MagicJohn: You could just loan me one.... work for uber peraps?

10) Babamots: Pass
	MagicJohn: So, keeping colors diversified is import so one is harder to shut out. By trading here my intent is to gain a blue "foothold" and if you build green I am closer to reaching the #2 ships (green group in this case) that I need to build and exchange for yellow.?.?
	Babamots: The trouble with what you describe is that Shelob only has room for one more blue. You'll need to build green at home and trade that for blue if you want to work toward mediums through blue. I'm pretty sure I will have all the y2 before you get a b2.
 
I've been looking for another way for you to get yellow. Here's some reasoning about the closest thing I've found:
 
1) build g1 MagicJohn
2) trade g3 y3 MagicJohn
3) build y2 MagicJohn
 
The danger here is that you would then have three yellow at home. If I move
 
1) ... build y2 Babamots
2) ... discover y1 Babamots g2 Iconia
3) ... sacrifice y2 Babamots move y1 Iconia MagicJohn (2 moves) catastrophe MagicJohn y
 
then I would win. So you need to avoid overpopulation by moving your y3 to a new system after your move 2:
 
2B) discover y3 MagicJohn g3 Grishnak
3B) build y1 Grishnak
 
Since you only have a small at home now, I might try to do a red-based invasion, for example
 
2B) ... trade y1 r1 Babamots
3B) ... sacrifice y2 Babamots move y1 Iconia MagicJohn (2 moves) 
4B) ...sacrifice r1 Babamots attack g1 MagicJohn
 
and I win. So you would need to move your y3 back home before that:
 
4B) move y3 Grishnak MagicJohn
 
So, now the population of your home is your y3, my g1 and y1. There are three yellows, so you need to trade quick, and preferably capture the pesky invaders. The most likely thing seems to be
 
5B) trade y3 r3 MagicJohn
6B) attack g1 MagicJohn (or y1 if I moved the g1 on my move 5)
 
In the end, you still have a y1 in Grishnak and can build more yellow when it suits you,
 
All of that analysis is just to make sure you can get a yellow without losing immediately. Since my most aggressive moves can't kill you, I will probably do something a little different, starting on move 2 or 3.
 
Some day, I want to make an online Homeworlds move explorer. Something that would let me play out a bunch of moves for experimentation and share the results with a link. All this text is hard to work with.
	Babamots: Sigh. I forgot that it was my turn. So really, none of that analysis holds up. The plan I just suggested puts you within one move of death a couple of times, so you would actually just lose.
 
Well, I know how to fix that.

11) MagicJohn: Build G1 Magicjohn

12) Babamots: Build Y2 Babamots

13) MagicJohn: Discover G3 Magicjohn Y3 Gandalf

14) Babamots: Discover Y1 Babamots B2 Bolius
	Babamots: It was late when I wrote that long advice. There are more mistakes in there. Don't believe it too much :-P

15) MagicJohn: Trade G1 R1 Magicjohn

16) Babamots: Sacrifice G3 Babamots
Build Y2 Bolius
Build Y2 Bolius
Build Y3 Babamots

17) MagicJohn: Build G1 Gandalf
	Babamots: I think the best thing for you right now is to build more ships. If you build in Gandalf, you can move the g3 back home while keeping the y3 piece reserved for yourself. If you're able to get a yellow pieces later, you can sacrifice the green in Gandalf to make a ship out of the y3 marker.
	Babamots: My current plan is to hog the yellows as tightly as I can to keep you from moving around much.
	Babamots: Sorry I haven't done better at teaching this game. If I had charged you for the lesson, I would offer a refund.

18) Babamots: Trade Y3 G3 Babamots

19) MagicJohn: Move G3 Gandalf Magicjohn

20) Babamots: Build Y3 Babamots
	MagicJohn: I do seem to be chasing my tail here. I have,however discovered how quickly a game can go sideways. Which move put me so blatantly on the defensive or was it a cumulative thing exacerbated by moving second. (yes I know you passed a turn already....)Perhaps my original setup paired badly with yours? 
	MagicJohn: I would have liked to trade green for yellow, but, alas, no blue technology in that sector.
	MagicJohn: I suspect you are now going to sac green and add yellow and two greens?
	Babamots: The initial setup (homeworld-ship pairs) isn't the problem. The trouble started on your third move when you discovered Shelob. Games are easier to study in "archive" view:
 
http://www.superdupergames.org/?page=archive_play&gid=34284&idx=4
 
After that, I trade for a y1. You then had two choices: 1) get locked out of yellow (since I was about the build the last y1) or 2) trade g1 for y1 in Shelob (which is a unattractive since it leaves you with no green in Shelob and you moved there in order to build and trade).
 
So with hindsight, on your third move, I think you should have traded g1 for y1. You could then have proceed to build more more green at home and used those to set up new systems for building.
	Babamots: If I sac my green now, I won't be able to build any green (you must still have a green ship in order to build green). I'm just going to build a y3 normally.
 
The problem this presents for you is that, if you trade g3 for y3 at home, I can move a y2 to a large system (say, Shelob). Then, if you don't trade or move your y3, I can sacrifice my y3 for a yellow catastrophe in your home (destroying your only large ship and one of your stars).
 
All that to say, it's not safe to trade your g3 for y3 now (in my long analysis before, I thought you could make it, but it's not turning out that way).

21) MagicJohn: Build G1 Shelob
	Babamots: Your advantage right now is that you have greens that are spread out. If we both start building green,
 
you get g1 (I suggest in Shelob)
I get g2
you get g2 (I suggest in MagiJohn)
I get g2 (assuming I don't come up with a better idea)
you sacrifice g3 and build g2 (Shelob), g3 (MagicJohn), g3 (Gandalf)
 
At this point, you would have a pretty good grip on greens (I have 3 green ships, you have 12). Your highest concentration is three greens in Shelob (g1,g1,g2) which I could catastrophe by sacrificing a y2 to move in a g2 (a fine trade for you). You would also have a g3 in Gandalf that could discover a blue system and change to y3.
 
I may try to do something to thwart your plan instead of building that second g2, but building green at least brings you closer to exploiting your advantage.
	Babamots: I can't sacrifice my g3 to build lots of green because they'd all be in the same system and cause a catastrophe. That's why your spread-out greens are better.

22) Babamots: Build G2 Babamots
	Babamots: I've just been talking to a new player, DodoBirb. I think he would benefit from practicing with some more people and I suggested you. I hope that's ok.

23) MagicJohn: Build G2 Magicjohn

24) Babamots: Discover Y2 Bolius G3 Risa
	Babamots: I keep messing up when typing in long suggestions. I included a fourth g2 construction back in that plan, but the principle is still good. Grab all the green.

25) MagicJohn: Build G2 Gandalf

26) Babamots: Build Y3 Risa

27) MagicJohn: Build R1 Magicjohn
	Babamots: I need to get a red ship soon. Otherwise, you can start invading my systems and I'll just have to run.
 
To get red, I will have to either trade a yellow (giving you an opportunity to trade for a yellow ship at last) or else trade a green (in which case I lose my factory).
 
If you don't remember, a "factory" is a g3 with another green ship while there are no g1 or g2 in the bank. Sacrificing the g3 lets you rebuild g3 and take two other build actions in one turn.

28) Babamots: Trade Y2 R2 Bolius

29) MagicJohn: Sacrifice B1 Shelob
Trade G2 Y2 Gandalf

30) Babamots: Sacrifice G2 Babamots
Build G2 Babamots
Build R2 Bolius
	MagicJohn: If I trade for y in magicjohn you can create a disaster next move but it would cost you 3 ships. how do you judge the point at which that is a good exchange?
	Babamots: Hmm, I hadn't actually noticed that. That catastrophe would make things very scary for you since our homes would be connected. In fact, I think I would win a few turns later: I sacrifice y2 to move two larges into your home and then sacrifice r2 to attack your large and the one large of mine that you presumably attacked. But that is late-night calculating.
 
I think you still can't trade for a yellow. Sorry :-(.
 
I'll look for something better for you in the morning.
	Babamots: I think you should
 
sacrifice b1 Shelob
trade g2 y2 Gandalf
 
I could cause a catastrophe in Gandalf (at a high price to me), but I'm quite sure that wouldn't be worth it.
 
After that, I think you should work on moving your new yellow ship somewhere safe so you can build Gandalf's marker into a ship.
	Babamots: I think your next best options are 1) factory-building r2 and b1 or 2) discovering a y2 system with a green in Gandalf. I don't think either of these is nearly as good as safely getting a y2 though.
	MagicJohn: I inputted the following orders "sacrifice b1 Shelob trade g2 y2 Gandalf" and received a message that I have one unused action... What's up with that?
	Babamots: You need to put a line break between the sacrifice and the action taken with the sacrifice, exactly how it looks in my move suggestion.
 
It's weird, I know.

31) MagicJohn: Build G2 Gandalf
	MagicJohn: Thnx

32) Babamots: Move R2 Bolius Shelob Risa

33) MagicJohn: Move R1 Magicjohn Gandalf

34) Babamots: Attack G1 Shelob

37) MagicJohn: Discover Y2 Gandalf B2 Elron

38) Babamots: Attack G1 Shelob

39) MagicJohn: Move Y2 Elron Babamots
Catastrophe Babamots Yellow

40) Babamots: Sacrifice Y2 Risa
Move G1 Shelob Magicjohn
Move G1 Shelob Magicjohn
Catastrophe Magicjohn G
	MagicJohn: Little could you know, but my g1 ships have been equipped with self-destruct buttons that I can activate from anywhere in adjacent quadrants... 

41) MagicJohn: Trade R1 G1 Magicjohn
	MagicJohn: Was there any other way of dealing with the threat than running away from home?
	Babamots: Boobytrapping your abandoned equipment? Fiendish!
	Babamots: I think that you were better off ignoring the green catastrophe threat and moving your y2 into my home for a yellow catastrophe. You would be left with no yellow ships, but it would have freed up the supply so you could trade for some.
	Babamots: I can give you some time to contemplate that and undo if you like.
 
Otherwise, I'm going to split up my yellow ships so you don't get another chance. I actually didn't notice that your y2 had got close enough or I would have responded earlier. That was a mistake for me.

42) Babamots: Trade R2 G2 Bolius
	MagicJohn: OK, lets see where it goes...
	MagicJohn: Not liking the "follow-up catastrophes" possible in magicjohn....

43) MagicJohn: Discover G1 Magicjohn G3 Golum
	Babamots: With two reds at home, you're vulnerable to another catastrophe. I think you'll want to trade one for a yellow or green.

44) Babamots: Move R3 Bolius Golum

	Babamots: It looks bad for you, but it's not quite over. You need to get a non-red to your home system this turn. You could last a few more moves if you trade your r3 or move a green back home.
 
On the other hand, I'll totally understand if you're done. I hope you've learned a little this game and maybe even had some fun :-)
	MagicJohn: Sorry for the time warp. I spent a week in the mountains in Colorado and forgot to leave a message.
	Babamots: No problem! I had some other games to think about in the meantime. Would you like to finish this game? We could also start another teaching game or I can point you to another practice partner.
	MagicJohn: I seemed to be playing catch-up after the first two or three moves. What move put me on the defensive so quickly?
	Babamots: The trouble started on your third move, when you moved your small ship away from your home:
 
http://www.superdupergames.org/?page=archive_play&gid=34284&idx=4
 
On your next move, you would have liked to build another g1 and then trade for a y1 (which would let you build more yellow later). But I saw that I could get both y1 before you could execute that plan (which would lock you out of yellow).
 
Your backup plan, once I traded for a y1 on my turn 3, should have been to trade g1 for y1 in Shelob. Even though all that y1 could do is move to a new system (preferably green so you could build more yellow), that's better than getting locked out of the yellow economy.
 
I didn't do a good job of giving you advice on the early moves, so it's as much my fault as yours. Hopefully it taught you something though :-)
