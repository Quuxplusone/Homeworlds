	jeep: Uh... ignore my last comment, I thought this was a different game.
	GeepaMoogle: I was about to say..  Well, I think I was toast whenever your large piece moved in and you had some reds ready to sacrifice.  However, I thought making my own that you would then retreat, and I could then make use of my factories somehow
