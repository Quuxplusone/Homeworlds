	Draw5PlayAll: JoeHill (1,2) => any 3 => any 2 => ratpfink (1,3).
As of now a 1-system is not connected to either side.
	Draw5PlayAll: If you sac a Y3 (for 3 movements) you can send a ship from one homeworld to the other.
 
Also note if on earth of the stars gets blown up the connections are altered.
	Joe_Hill: Right, I understood all that, but thank you. I guess I was just incorrectly thinking of distance as linear instead of the way it is. 
	Joe_Hill: Have to shake off the squares of the chess board.
	Joe_Hill: Mentally shake them off.
