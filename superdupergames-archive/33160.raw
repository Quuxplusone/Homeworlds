Variants: "No undo, Unrated, Sinister, Hard time"
Started: 2017.9.13, Ended: 2017.9.30
Participants: dlwillson (S), Felix (N), wil (E)
Winner: wil

1) Felix: Homeworld Y2 B3 G3
	dlwillson: Hi guys! Thanks for accepting the challenge! This is just a friendly game. Un-ranked, no take backs, sinister. Cause the player on your left to lose, and you win!
	dlwillson: I gave it a short starting bank, but a big max bank in case one of us has a business trip or vacation in the Himalayas or somewhere else there's no signal.

2) wil: H Y2 B1 G3
	Felix: No problem, should be fun :)
	wil: How did I sign up for a multiple game?  Oh well....its you two...maybe it will work.
	wil: So I gotta take out Willson...hmmm

3) dlwillson: H B3 Y1 G3

4) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	wil: Reminder for attacks...  ship must also be specified as belonging to a particular player by appending that player's seat designation (eg. G2S, B1E).
	wil: Not that anyone has red
	dlwillson: Wil: I like movies live music, and Scotch.
	Felix: Interesting. I assumed at least one of you would take some red! 
 
@wil Thanks for the tip :)
 
@dlwillson bahahaha, I see what you did there.

5) wil: B G1 Wil
	wil: My plan is taking you on a long walk in the woods...

6) dlwillson: B G1 Dlwillson
	wil: I'd like to devise a tourney where everyone starts at.the same game
..one that is half over, 3/4ths the pieces in play, and evenly matched...a coin flip decides who gets which side and the other person goes first...   As an attempt to shorten tourney duration...thoughts?
	wil: I'd also like "two moves to mate" puzzles.
	wil: And a root beer float
	wil: Not really, I don't like root beer...but I'll have that scotch.

7) Felix: Trade G1 R1 Felix
	dlwillson: That tournament idea is great! And, the positions don't need to be balanced, you just play two games from those positions and switch seats for the second game.
	Felix: Interesting idea. How do you get the game to that midway point in the first place, though?

8) wil: Trade G1 Y1 Wil

9) dlwillson: Trade G1 R1 Dlwillson
	wil: I'm thinking either just pick a tight game, or make up a tight game...  that will be one of the turning points in this game...when folks can stop and say...this is where I went wrong...lets back up to that point and see where it goes. 

10) Felix: B R1 Felix

11) wil: B Y1 Wil

12) dlwillson: B G1 Dlwillson

13) Felix: Trade R1 Y1 Felix
	dlwillson: I think that's a great idea. A little like duplicate bridge.

14) wil: D Y1 Wil G3 G3
	wil: Yes, I hadn't thought of that, but yes.

15) dlwillson: B R1 Dlwillson

16) Felix: Build Y2 Felix

17) wil: S G3 Wil
B Y2 G3

18) dlwillson: Discover R1 Dlwillson B2 Sea
	wil: If Felix attacks it gives him the advantage over me yet gives Willson the advantage over him?  
	dlwillson: Good Lord! What's going on around here?!
 
And yes, that's a good synopsis of sinister.

19) Felix: Discover Y1 Felix G1 Out

20) wil: T Y3 G3 Wil
	Felix: So, so tempting...
	wil: Not when I actually just gave you the yellow threes dangit!

21) dlwillson: B R1 Dlwillson

22) Felix: Move Y1 Out G3
Catastrophe G3 Yellow

23) wil: Build G1 Wil
	Felix: Also tempting, but I had to serve the greater good!
	dlwillson: Your charity is noted, but any credit is moderated by a note that Wil is to your left.
	wil: Wow...traded out getting into the threes...

24) dlwillson: Build R2 Dlwillson
	Draw5PlayAll: Whoa, this confused me! It felt like I had been eliminated from the 4P game for some reason...
	Draw5PlayAll: About your tournament idea, it could be that one player picks the position and the other player picks which side they are on, so you have an incentive to balance the position or risk getting the worse side. 
 
Playing two games from an unbalanced position will recreate the one thing I dislike about the game ChessCards, which is that most of the time there is an easy win that P1 has to demonstrate for P2 and you just get a draw every time.
 
And wil, this is not a comment about your current game, just on an idea you guys had.
	wil: lol

	Felix: Captain, your petulant little attacks have left our fleet (what remains of it) floundering, without access to propulsion technology. What should we do?
 
"KEEP FIRING!!!!!!!!"
 
Sir, we have no weapons either. What shall we do?
 
"....LUDICROUS SPEED.... GO!"
 
But I already told you, we have no propu-
 
"LUDICROUS GREEN.... GO!!!!"
 
Well... alright then.

48) dlwillson: Build G2 Dlwillson

49) Felix: Build G2 Out
	dlwillson: Do you play Magic? Back when the game made sense, I used to call green stompy decks "stupid green", because you didn't have to know any strategy or do anything clever. Just play the cards and stomp the crap out of the other guy before s/he does something crafty. (Like suicide black, but without the risk of killing yourself first accidentally.)
	wil: Not I, but stupid green is a thing...
	dlwillson: I can never *quite* get rid of the urge to bring black into Homeworlds somehow. And I'm embarassed to admit that I just *now* realized that the Rainbow colors are the Magic colors. No, wait... They're not. Rainbow has yellow; MTG has white. So, I guess there's a partial Moody Blues transformation "red is grey and yellow white"... Something something... I need to get back to work.
	dlwillson: I suppose technically, there's no reason black *couldn't* be in the game *without* adding rules. It just wouldn't carry a technology, because it doesn't have a color. Being forced to choose one black pyramid for something on turn zero could be a mild handicap for a strong player.
	dlwillson: Being forced to choose a black *ship* could be a moderate handicap for a stronger player.
	Felix: That could actually be a bit interesting. It doesn't carry any technology in itself, but it can passively use the tech of other ships or stars either by sharing a star or from sacrifice moves. Interesting, but beyond that one use as a handicap piece, I'm not really sure what other use there'd be for the concept. I never played Magic. I wasn't even allowed to play with Pokemon cards as a kid :P

	wil: I have a new player, yet to learn the complexities of the game, wants to add a purple...  also wants to add docking to the game (a one going into a two and increasing power and or tech but not both)

	wil: well dang...no coin moving...so much for not double checking

52) Felix: T G3 Y3 Felix
	dlwillson: no coin moving?
	wil: No undo... I've used the solo undo here often as the turn token...
	dlwillson: I'm still not sure I understand, but I will not turn off undo anymore.

M Y3 G3 Wil

C Eastern_sky R
	Felix: The docking idea has some potential as a variant... but I just don't see the need to tweak the game at all. It's already so well balanced. I do like the idea of some variants though. There is a "worldships" variant on board game geek that has a lot of potential, though I've never played it.
	wil: Yes, I told the kid (but he already knows everything) when he learns to beat me regularly...then he should contemplate improving the game that I enjoy more than chess...that I played for 50 years....

57) dlwillson: Move Y2 Sea G3
	wil: So is it last man standing or first one to knock out the homeworld to their left?  Vastly different strategy....if you need to be strong enough to be attacked after attacking...
	wil: So you guys don't use a turn token in live play?  So you can rearrange ships.and stars a few times before you make your final decision?  And then when you have come.to.the conclusion slide.the coin to the other player after multiple "undo's"?
	dlwillson: The first player to lose causes the player to his right to win.

	wil: Ah, thanx...  And you both are to be commended on the speed of this game!!  
	wil: Idk what you are plotting dl

60) dlwillson: Move Y2 Sea Doubt

61) Felix: Build G2 Doubt
	dlwillson: I forgot to answer about the token. No, I've never used a turn-token in real life. I have used a chess-clock, though... Is it still a chess-clock, if one is using it for Homeworlds?
	dlwillson: I don't know what I'm plotting, either. I hope I figure it out, soon.
	Felix: I've not used the turn token much, myself, though I've tried. Usually we just end up doing it verbally: "Ok, your turn" instead of with an actual token.

68) wil: B G2 Wil
	Draw5PlayAll: I want to use turn tokens and the end up forgetting.
	dlwillson: I've tried to to use turn tokens, but they always fall. Someone forgets, someone accepts the nonverbal, non-token cue, and that's the end of it.

	dlwillson: LOL! :-) Excellent!

	dlwillson: That was an excellent game, I think. Felix, we both did something. I sacrificed my red. Really good game. I'll be more careful next time. :-)
	Felix: It's so hard to prepare for the repercussions of your moves when there are two opponents between each of your turns!
	dlwillson: Shall we do it again, but with take-backs?
	Felix: I'm game!
	wil: I'm in...as long as you guys play just like you did...I thought you all were AWESOME!!
