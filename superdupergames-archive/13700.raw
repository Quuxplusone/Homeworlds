	ZackStack: I'm still having a mighty fine time playing Homeworlds (and will happily play as many games as you'd like)... but I wondered if you'd like to try any games that are brand new to both of us. I'm interested in Alien City and Pikemen.  Alien you could play tabletop if you made up some tiles and had another game to borrow some cubes for.  Pikemen it will be a while for tabletop, but its a popular chesslike icehouse game.  Let me know and I can set up a challenge (or we can just focus on Homeworlds for the time being...)  

23) ZackStack: Move G3 Oldyeller Joe
	ZackStack: Hey Joe!  You know to take over a ship you need one ship of equal size in the system right? In other words... moving that R2 to your homeworld wasn't a defense against my G3 ship.  Feel free to undo if you'd like (or we can just see what happens...)
	Joe: Yup, I know that I cannot destroy it with the R2 ;)
And I will happily play Alien City, cause it is just the game I am tinkering about (and read the rules two days ago!). I have issued a challenge already so you can jump on that vagon if you like...

24) Joe: Move R3 Mb Bigblue

25) ZackStack: Sacrifice R3 Zackstack

Attack R2S Joe
	ZackStack: Sorry Joe... you missed a big one!
	Joe: Ah, yes - attacking in a system with your ship, sacrificing R3 far far away ;)
