The files in this directory are raw dumps from the e-mail archive pages at
SuperDuperGames: http://superdupergames.org/main.html?page=listoldgames

All files ending in ".raw" can be converted to my "standard" format for 
game transcripts by running them through the Python script "./cook.py". 
This strips out the header added to each game by SuperDuperGames,
eliminates comments, and converts each move to standard move format
(single actions with uniform spelling, separated by semicolons ";").

To convert everything in this directory, for example, you should run

    ./cook.py *.raw

This will produce two kinds of output files:

    $GAMENUMBER.cooked

These files can be run through "../homeworlds-cli --verify" cleanly.
The "cook.py" script may have made some minor adjustments to them;
for example, eliminating a final "suicide" move at the end of the
game, or repositioning catastrophes to occur in the end-of-turn
position. "cook.py" will explain when it does something like this.

    $GAMENUMBER.cooked-but-invalid

These files are not cleanly accepted by "../homeworlds-cli --verify",
usually because they exploit SDG's different game logic regarding
catastrophes. The exact reason for rejecting these games is
explained either by "cook.py" or by the commit message for
"cook.py".
