The files in this directory are raw dumps from the e-mail archive pages at
SuperDuperGames: http://superdupergames.org/main.html?page=listoldgames

All files ending in ".raw" can be converted to my "standard" format for 
game transcripts by running them through the Perl script "./cook.pl". 
This strips out the header added to each game by SuperDuperGames, 
replaces comments by "# skipped a comment by johndoe" comment 
indicators, and converts each move to standard move format (single 
actions with uniform spelling, separated by semicolons ";").

The bash shell script "./cook-everything.sh" produces "*.cooked" from 
"*.raw" for all "*.raw" in the current directory.  The bash shell script
"../verify-raws.sh" generates "*.cooked" and runs each of them through
"../annotate -verify" to check that each transcript represents a legal
game.

Raw files whose contents seem damaged or ambiguous end with ".raw-raw".
This includes "710.raw-raw", in which the server allowed an illegal
move (a bug that was subsequently fixed).
Also "9329.raw-raw" and "10575.raw-raw", a different illegal move
(which I don't know whether it was eventually fixed).
Also "10634.raw-raw", in which the server allowed moves after the end
of the game.

As of 2010-03-30, this directory contains all the games from the
SuperDuperGames archive up to 2009-02-28 inclusive, except for games 
which were abandoned very early, or were obviously being played by 
beginners.
