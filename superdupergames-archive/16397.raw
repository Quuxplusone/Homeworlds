Participants: goulo (S), AdamBadura (N)
Winner: AdamBadura

1) AdamBadura: Homeworld B3 G2 R3

2) goulo: Homeworld G1 B2 Y3

3) AdamBadura: Build R1 Adambadura

4) goulo: Build Y1 Goulo

5) AdamBadura: Trade R1 Y1 Adambadura
	goulo: I am talking with planszoweczka Michal/meehau at bgg about ordering some more pyramids in the 'correct' rainbow colors for this game and for RAMbots (a robot combat programming game I think you'd enjoy and I want to try). :)

6) goulo: Trade Y3 R3 Goulo

7) AdamBadura: Build R1 Adambadura
	AdamBadura: If you establish anything then let me know and maybe I would join in the order.

8) goulo: Build R1 Goulo
	goulo: Right now the open question is whether he can get 5 Rainbow sets from rebel immediately or soon. I don't want partial (fewer than 15 pyramids in each color) sets again, that was frustrating. :) Meanwhile I am definitely ordering a full pink set. :) Also Martian Coasters. He said he orders from rebel.pl each Tuesday, so let him know before 11.00 tomorrow, it seems, or else wait a week. :) I will tell you what I learn about getting the set of 5 Rainbows.

9) AdamBadura: Trade R1 B1 Adambadura
	AdamBadura: I thought it was more complex thus. If he just tkaes them from Rebel then he may do it any time and there is no rush for me. Thanks for info.

10) goulo: Build R1 Goulo
	goulo: He might get a higher discount if more people order the same thing, I don't know. :)
 
But right, no rush. The advantage ordering through him is no shipping costs and a possible small discount.

11) AdamBadura: Build B1 Adambadura

12) goulo: Trade R1 G1 Goulo

13) AdamBadura: Build R1 Adambadura

14) goulo: Discover R3 Goulo G3 Zarkcity

15) AdamBadura: Pass
	AdamBadura: Let me know what price Micha³ offers (can offer). 5 sets costs in Rebel ~150 and it feels a bit much. After all I could get a good game with that price while here I get a set of plastic pyrmides... ;) (My wide would not understand that too... :)) Pity that book is out in Rebel.
	AdamBadura: Hmmmm... You forced me into bad situation here. I wonder what should I do now.

16) goulo: Build Y1 Goulo

17) AdamBadura: Build Y2 Adambadura
	goulo: I wonder if I would have passed also, if that would have ended the game in a tie...?

18) goulo: Build Y2 Goulo
	AdamBadura: That is a good question. :)

19) AdamBadura: Trade Y2 G2 Adambadura
	AdamBadura: By the way. Is this game playable with more than 2 players? I guess it is not. But I don't see technical reasons for not allowing it. There are at least 4 well distinguishable angles..

20) goulo: Move Y1 Goulo Zarkcity

21) AdamBadura: Build Y2 Adambadura
	goulo: Yes, it can have more than 2, and I want to play it that way. (I have in real life.) The rules talk about it.
	AdamBadura: Did you really wanted to make this move (catastrophe!)? If not then undo it.
	AdamBadura: Then we can try it here or in real life sometime. I would like to experience it.
	goulo: Thanks for the undo. That was indeed a lame move. :)

22) goulo: Build R1 Goulo
	goulo: This game is surprisingly and interestingly easy to make really bad mistakes in, considering how simple and elegant its rules are. :)
	goulo: I hope to get more people in the local club interested in playing! And not just Homeworlds; I suspect some people may enjoy RAMbots (which I've not played yet) as it seems to be similar to RoboRally but more elegant and without the randomness of card draws, just the chaos of simultaneous robot programming.

23) AdamBadura: Build R2 Adambadura
	AdamBadura: What you told me about this game indeed seems interesting so I would gladly try it out. Saddly I tend to come less often to locla club nowadays. I prefer playing at home (either my place or Max's) - but that doesn't happen that often either.

24) goulo: Build R2 Zarkcity

25) AdamBadura: Discover R2 Adambadura G1 Throughtheages

26) goulo: Move R3 Zarkcity Throughtheages

27) AdamBadura: Move R1 Adambadura Throughtheages
	AdamBadura: Are we going to build all the ships before we get to real action - I wonder? :)
	AdamBadura: And as it comes to how easy is to make really bad mistake let me remaind you that I lost previous three games due to the same stupid mistake... ;)

28) goulo: Attack R2 Throughtheages

29) AdamBadura: Build R2 Throughtheages
Catastrophe Throughtheages R

30) goulo: Trade Y1 B1 Goulo

31) AdamBadura: Discover B1 Adambadura Y1 Newbetterworld
	AdamBadura: Haven't you forseen that?
	goulo: ah, clever!
	goulo: No, I was thinking only that you might move your R3 from AdamBadura to ThroughTheAges. Forgot that it was a green star so you could construct there. Such a sneaky game! :)

32) goulo: Build B2 Goulo

33) AdamBadura: Build G1 Adambadura

38) goulo: Sacrifice Y1 Zarkcity
Move G2 Tzaar Newbetterworld
Catastrophe Newbetterworld G

39) AdamBadura: Trade Y1 G1 Adambadura
	AdamBadura: Actually I didn't plant that. When I saw your ship invade my solar system I paniced. ;) But after caliming down I thought to my self that now I have to do whatever I can. Obviously moving R3 there would be a suicide. But then I thought about moving R1 and taking advantage.
 
Also I think you should have instead of attacking me sacrifice Y1 or Y2 and run away. Unless you realized what was comming to you first when you actually saw it.

40) goulo: Build Y1 Goulo

	AdamBadura: Show them no mercy as you will receive none! KILL THEM ALL!
	AdamBadura: Honestly there was time (at least one my round; but I think there were few such rounds) in which I could destroy your blue technology by moving my blue ship with sacrificed yellow ship. But when I realized that it was to late becase on your turn you moved away the blue ship.
	AdamBadura: This game is indeed interesting.
 
The interactions are deep. Shared usage of stars adds much to the game.
 
But I think with more than 2 players it will become a little chaotic. Still I want to try it that way. Does this system allow that?
 
I have browsed through rules briefly and saw with muylti-player there is Good/Evil and special victory conditions which do not go well with this game I guess as they introduce hidden information (but still might be interesting). This was surprising as I thought there will be "one man standing" mode...
	AdamBadura: If the RAMbots game is as interesting (and it sounds so) then I will reconsider buying pyrmids as 150 z³ for two good games is fine (also the games have the advantage of taking little space and being playable in travel or similar conditions).
	goulo: yes, i noticed that you had an opportunity to do a blue catastrophe a while back and was relieved that you didn't. but after i lost my 3-ship early on, it seems this game was very hard for me in any case. i see now that the 3-ship we start with must stay safe! :)
	goulo: Multiplayer homeworlds in its original form has the hidden good/evil stuff (like the werewolf/mafia type games), which indeed seems strange to me too. But there is also the "sinister" variant, where you win by killing the player to your left. And of course there is "last survivor wins" variant. So no problem, just don't play the good/evil version. :)

	AdamBadura: Yes. I think that loosing that ship was the beginning of the end (I think you will lose if I will not make any stupid move). Its not that one definitly looses after loosing 3-ship but it is much more defence later one.
 
Note thou that you had lots of opportunities to build a 3-ship (you still have).
	goulo: if you want to play on, we can, but i think i can safely resign this game and start a new one if you like. let me know... :)
	goulo: every chance i had to build a 3-ship, you could have then moved in to make a catastrophe. it was frustrating! :)
	AdamBadura: OK, lets play new game
	goulo: congrats. :)
	goulo: Not my day for playing well. I just got my butt kicked in online Hive tournament (opponent won 3 games, I won 1). Ouch!
