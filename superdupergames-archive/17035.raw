	rootbier: I need to work on my "Cage Match" games (that's what I've been calling the close home setups in my head). I think a strong red presence means a lot more in the tight quarters.

27) rootbier: Sacrifice G1 Rootbier
Build B3 Sprout
	bhorner: I usually play with at least 3 people, so this is a different experience for me.  I like the lack of politics.  I think you're probably much more aware of important aspects than I am.

29) rootbier: Move G1 Rootbier Sprout

30) bhorner: Sacrifice G1 Tricky
Build B3 Other
	rootbier: I was expecting you to cat my blues at home. Was a good opportunity for you.
 
I have only played a couple 3/4 player games. Actually none of them have played through yet - with one of the four disappearing on each one (which leaves some weird ghost ships floating out there). So far they have all been pretty non-political. Are you talking about cutting deals and the like? I have been trying to stay away from that and as far as I can tell the same is true for my opponents. There is of course some amount of it in there no matter what. Like... if I move in this third ship - will the next guy throw in a fourth so we can be rid of those 3s there. Blah blah.
 
I would like to play more larger ones. Mmm.

31) rootbier: Trade B2 R2 Sprout
	bhorner: The politics comes in with the alignment cards...  "Are you evil?", "Are you good?"  I don't know how they run multiplayer on this site.  We play pretty much daily at lunch, but no one will play me 1 v 1.
 
I would have lost my big blue, and had little remaining offense if I cat'ed half your home world...  I may not know how to finish very well...

32) bhorner: Trade B1 G1 Jen
	rootbier: Ahh you mean in person. Ok yeah. I think I would totally skip that and just play Sinister or last man standing.
 
You would have still had your R3 - and I would be very far from getting another 3. With the short distances I think you could have given me some real trouble. Once the other guy is 3less you've got good chances.

33) rootbier: Move R2 Sprout Jen

34) bhorner: Discover G1 Jen Y3 Jenny
	bhorner: I didn't want to give it away, but I just did what I'd been planning to do instead of cat'ing your homeworld.  You could have stopped me if you'd moved a ship there.
	rootbier: I'm not sure I see the one more 3 does for you that having me completely WITHOUT a 3 wouldn't have done. You're not in position to really threaten me with a blue cat problem invasion and  all I have to do to stop you from coming in hard with your two 3s is trade one of my B2s to R2.
 
Maybe I'm missing something. Suppose we'll find out.

35) rootbier: Move R2 Jen Other
	bhorner: I was wracking my brain, and couldn't see a way out for you.  The trade to r2 solved the problem.  :)

Catastrophe Rootbier Green

	rootbier: I suppose that's what smelly old lithuanian surprise house guests will do - make you not see the simple threats in front of you. I am very very ashamed of myself for paying so little attention. Set up the rematch and watch out!
	bhorner: sorry I didn't see the new chat until just now...  you had smelly old lithuanian surprise house guests???  That seems like a major disadvantage.  :)  I'll set up the rematch right now.
