Participants: ringebri (S), MagicJohn (N)
Winner: MagicJohn

1) MagicJohn: Homeworld B2 R1 G3

2) ringebri: Homeworld G3 B1 Y3
	ringebri: I tried this command: homeworld g2,b1,y3.  Why doesn't it work.
	ringebri: homeworld g3,b1,y3
	ringebri: homeworld g3, b1, y3 doesn't work either.

3) MagicJohn: Build G1 Magicjohn
	ringebri: ok. the command line can't have commas in it.

4) ringebri: Build Y1 Ringebri
	ringebri: Just re-read the wiki.  Not good to have the same size systems as your opponent.

5) MagicJohn: Build G1 Magicjohn
	MagicJohn: Now the point is to build as quickly as possible. Maybe try to monopolize a color. I might have an advantage because I will try to build green and that is the color of one of your home stars.

6) ringebri: Trade Y1 R1 Ringebri

7) MagicJohn: Trade G1 Y1 Magicjohn

8) ringebri: Build Y1 Ringebri

9) MagicJohn: Discover G1 Magicjohn Y3 Overachiever
	MagicJohn: Had to trade for a yellow so I can expand and keep building..
	MagicJohn: My building will probably be in green or blue so I can directly attack one of your stars...
	MagicJohn: I can build in green without duplicating the color of one of my own stars.

10) ringebri: Discover Y1 Ringebri B2 Underdog

11) MagicJohn: Build G1 Overachiever

12) ringebri: Build Y1 Ringebri

13) MagicJohn: Discover G1 Overachiever Y2 Overandout
	MagicJohn: Trying to stay undertheradar?
	MagicJohn: I'm dealing with a monster hedcode. Hope my thinking is clearer than my sinuses, throat, and chest......
	ringebri: Oh good!  Here's my chance..... Oh!  Sorry.  I hope you feel better soon!

14) ringebri: Build Y2 Ringebri

15) MagicJohn: Build Y2 Magicjohn

16) ringebri: Discover Y2 Ringebri G2 Undercat
	ringebri: Now I've got three yellow in my homeworld, which I guess is risky.  But I don't think your y1 in your homeworld can reach my homeworld at this time.  Right?
	MagicJohn: Not really risky yet. To get to your home world from mine, I would have to sacrifice a Y3, move to a #3 star, then to a #2 star, and finally to your homeworld. Since I don't have a Y3, I can't send my Y1 directly to your homeworld. 
	MagicJohn: I would first have to trade my g3 for a y3 and you would see that coming and move a ship or take another defensive action.
	MagicJohn: Or I could do the following play, gain some ship-power, and force your hand.

17) MagicJohn: Discover G1 Overandout Y3 Overandover
	MagicJohn: Scratch that. I was going to sac my g3 for a g1,y2 and y3. It would have given me 3 yellows in Magicjohn homeworld and you could have blown them up.

18) ringebri: Build Y2 Undercat

19) MagicJohn: Build G1 Overandover
	MagicJohn: keeping you from building another y3....

20) ringebri: Trade Y1 B1 Ringebri
	MagicJohn: Bear in mind that discovered star systems can be destroyed by over population. If the star goes boom, ALL of the ships surrounding it go boom too.

21) MagicJohn: Sacrifice G3 Magicjohn
Build G2 Overachiever
Build G2 Overachiever
Build G3 Overandover
	MagicJohn: So, lets say I put together a large fleet of ships on overandover and included in that fleet was a pair of yellow ships. If you moved one yellow ship in, the whole thing would go kablooie...

22) ringebri: Discover Y2 Undercat G3 Undercover

23) MagicJohn: Move G3 Overandover Magicjohn

24) ringebri: Build R1 Ringebri

25) MagicJohn: Discover G2 Overachiever R2 Overthelimit
	MagicJohn: You could blow up yellow tech at my homestar. (Sac y3 and move undercover y2 and underdog y1) On the down side, you would lose more than I would..... 
	MagicJohn: By having a corner on green technology, I control your chances of blowing me up.....

26) ringebri: Build Y1 Undercat
	ringebri: underdog and undercat do not have a connection to MagicJohn so I can't move yellow ships to MagicJohn from them. Right?
	MagicJohn: They can move there, but it's a two step process. If you sac. a 2y one ship could move two steps, from u-cat to u-cover(1) to MagicJohn(2).

	MagicJohn: build y2 magicjohn

43) MagicJohn: Sacrifice Y2 Magicjohn
Move G1 Overthelimit Ringebri
Move G2 Overthelimit Ringebri
	MagicJohn: Oppsie - Put my command in the messages box... Your move did give me access to more yellow technology. It remains to be seen if I can take advantage of it.
	MagicJohn: Besides, experimenting with the moves is fun and the best way to learn :)

	MagicJohn: Hello neighbor!

47) MagicJohn: Discover B2 Overachiever Y2 Overandout
	ringebri: bug off, invader!
	ringebri: even though I successfully converted one of your ships, I'm still in danger of losing the green system, right?
	MagicJohn: uhhhh..., yes..

48) ringebri: Trade Y1 G1 Ringebri
	MagicJohn: By sacrificing the g1 I could build a ship/color in any star system I wanted as long as I had a ship of that color in the star system. By sacrificing, I returned one green to the stash which I could bring back in play by way of building. My other option was to sacrifice my y2 in Magicjohn and move the g1 from overandover to undercat to ringebri. I didn't do that because I didn't want to loose a #2 ship or my only yellow. 
	MagicJohn: As an aside...
Ideally, it's best to maintain ships in your home star system that don't match the color of your home stars. Unfortunately, it isn't always possible to maintain that arrangement.
	MagicJohn: Now, if you loose or abandon your green star, you can't build at all. You might consider trading for a green ship pretty soon. I'll probably be going after blue but I could choose to try and suck up all of the green technology again..

	ringebri: out of recources.  can't protect my homeworld. conquered!  I think I'm beginning to understand this game.
	MagicJohn: Your play in the last half of the game showed a lot of improvement. Remember to leave a #3 ship and something red in your home system for defense. Good game...  (More than I can say for my last effort in chase.....)
