	cleverpun: Touche. The readout kept telling me that you had passed the time limit, but perhaps I was premature regardless.
	rootbier: I was indeed out of time and beyond. Taking the win though -- that's just generally not the way we do it around here.
 
It's not like there is a maximum number of games you can have going and you need to clear space -- so people tend to lean towards patience.

18) rootbier: Build G2 Rootbier

19) cleverpun: Trade G1 Y1 Cleverpun
	cleverpun: Well, still being new to the system, I'll admit that it was a faux pas on my end.
 
If you want an admin to delete it I wouldn't object (is deleting them even possible?); a win by default isn't something to be proud of anyway.
	rootbier: No no. Just keep playing. I'll whupp you slowly and then start giving nice advice on the next one :)
