Participants: Keith (S), zoltar (N)
Winner: zoltar

1) zoltar: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3
Keith: Hello Zoltar. I have played two unrated learning games with experts and I am now playing my first rated game (which I limited to an opponent not one of the top ten ranked players).

2) Keith: Homeworld B3 Y1 G3

3) zoltar: Build G1 Zoltar

4) Keith: Build G1 Keith

5) zoltar: Trade G1 Y1 Zoltar

6) Keith: Trade G1 B1 Keith
zoltar: Hi Keith. I've lost every game to experts, and have won 2 unrated games against another brand new player. I'm still getting a basic feel for the game, but I like it a lot.

7) zoltar: Build Y1 Zoltar

8) Keith: Discover B1 Keith G2 Midworld

9) zoltar: Discover Y1 Zoltar G3 Nix

10) Keith: Build G1 Keith

11) zoltar: Build Y2 Nix

12) Keith: Trade G1 B1 Keith
Keith: You do seem to have grasped the concept of color denial... like yellow.

13) zoltar: Build Y2 Zoltar
zoltar: Well, I was trying to get to the larger size upgrades faster than you, and yellow seemed to be the shortest path, so I got the first medium sized ship. In my game against good players, they literally get 2 ships for 1 of mine and I find myself hopelessly outnumbered by the middlegame. Don't quite know how I get tricked -- I'll have to review my games. For now, I'm going for grabbing the bigger ships first.

14) Keith: Build B2 Midworld
Keith: I did review your games before accepting your challenge. TwoShort is the top ranked player and quite adept at getting a factory up and running with safe places to build in. That and TwoShort's willingness to give advice in an unranked game is why I chose TwoShort for one of my mentoring/learning games.

15) zoltar: Build Y3 Nix

16) Keith: Trade B1 R1 Keith

17) zoltar: Trade Y2 R2 Zoltar

18) Keith: Trade B2 Y2 Midworld
zoltar: I have learned that as soon as your opponent gets a red, get a red immediately somewhere, or else you will get bushwhacked!
Keith: That is true. More importantly (for me) it puts me in the yellow game.

19) zoltar: Move Y3 Nix Midworld
zoltar: I'm confused as to how getting a red puts you in the yellow game, as it seems about the same if we both have a red or if neither of us does -- I hope I haven't missed something big!
Keith: To get a red you had to trade a yellow for it (or your G3 and temporarily give up a factory effort). Then I picked up that yellow.

20) Keith: Build B1 Midworld
zoltar: now that you have a yellow, I have to worry about you blowing up all my yellows if I would have let you join the party at nix! Two games ago I might have missed that, but now I'm older and wiser!

21) zoltar: Sacrifice R2 Zoltar
Attack Y2 Midworld
Attack B1 Midworld

22) Keith: Build B2 Midworld
zoltar: I'm back in the Yellow business again!
Keith: Hey...what happend to the theory of having a red ship if I have one? In other words I did not think of your doing that.

23) zoltar: Build B2 Midworld
Catastrophe Midworld B

24) Keith: Build G1 Keith
zoltar: Well, I'm playing "Palestinian style", and I can always grow a red back again. After all the destruction, I end up once again with -- Yellow!

25) zoltar: Build Y3 Zoltar

26) Keith: Build R1 Keith

27) zoltar: Trade Y3 R3 Zoltar
zoltar: t y3 r3 zoltar

28) Keith: Discover G1 Keith B2 Bell
zoltar: ok, ok, I get the message -- reds it is!
zoltar: I have to go will move again later this evening!

29) zoltar: Build Y3 Zoltar

30) Keith: Build G1 Keith
Keith: You now have a 4 to 1 lead in large ships and an 8 to 4 lead in ships overall. It should be just a matter of time before you figure out how to defeat me.

31) zoltar: Trade Y3 R3 Zoltar
zoltar: t y3 r3 zoltar
zoltar: Yes, I'm usually on the other end of this situation, so I'll do what the good players do against me and play solid and slowly consolodate my lead

32) Keith: Discover G1 Keith B2 Bird

33) zoltar: Build Y3 Zoltar

34) Keith: Build G1 Keith

35) zoltar: Build G2 Zoltar

36) Keith: Trade G3 Y3 Keith

38) Keith: Build G2 Keith

39) zoltar: Sacrifice G3 Zoltar
Build G3 Zoltar
Build G3 Zoltar
Build Y1 Midworld

40) Keith: Trade R1 Y1 Keith
Keith: Which is why I had been hesitant to trade for a Y3. Growing another imobile green ship wasn't working for me either.

41) zoltar: Sacrifice G3 Zoltar
Build G3 Zoltar
Build Y2 Nix
Build Y3 Nix
zoltar: Yup, I figured if you stopped me from taking the Y3, I could cause another catastrophe and then start building my yellows again from scratch, but now my big ships outnumber you 4-0

42) Keith: Move G1 Keith Zoltar
Catastrophe Zoltar Green

43) zoltar: Move R3 Zoltar Keith

Keith: Probably just a defiant gesture on my way out.
Keith: Probably just a defiant gesture on my way out.

46) Keith: Trade Y1 R1 Keith
zoltar: I never saw that coming, as I forgot that by rudely blowing up one of your stars, your homeworld is just a step away. Of course, that also means it's a step away for my red battlecruisers, and in big ships I still have the edge...
Keith: A big red enemy battle cruiser at my homeworld is a disadvantage to pointing out our homeworlds are now adjacent. At least I reduced the big ship ratio from 6 to 0 to 4 to 0... on my way out. You still have a huge advantage.
Keith: I have to head off for a 12 hour work shift.
zoltar: Yes, I think it's checkmate in 2 moves
Keith: I was not sure how long I could wait before you noticed the adjacent homeworlds or started moving green ships out. I thought about building the Y3 at keith and seeing if you went for another destruction cycle. That would have put large ship ratios at 3 to 0 if I still was able to pull off the green catastrophe at Zoltar.

47) zoltar: Attack R1 Keith
zoltar: Very nice defence!

zoltar: Good Game, my first rated win ever! Play again?
Keith: Hey, I made it to move 47! Very good game. You had me in trouble from very early on. Yes I would like to play again.
zoltar: Most of my games have been against good players who have me outplayed from the 3rd move and it only gets worse. It's great practice for me to play with another beginner so I can learn to attack and press an advantage when I get one. So let's play again; the practice will help us both learn the tricks to this clever game.
