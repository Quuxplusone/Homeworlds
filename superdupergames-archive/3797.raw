zoltar: Looks like I'm back to losing again -- back to my original strategy of taking out one of your stars before I die.

38) zoltar: Attack G1 Different
zoltar: Well, I missed that totally too. I'll try another move or two before I resign.

TwoShort: I made a big effort to to tighten up my game this time... still, these last 4 moves or so were skull-crushers.

41) TwoShort: Build R2 Grogar
zoltar: wow -- you could have sacked your y3 and destroyed all the reds in my homeworld -- I would have resigned if you had done that. I'm still dead now.
TwoShort: I considered it, but then I'd have had no sacrificeable red, so movign in to gfinish you off would be a muklti turn operation, and you could have used the slack to take the y3 I'd sac'd (which I could then catastrophe, but that would break the yellow embargo)... anyway, it didn't look like a done deal... More than once I've seen a game take a surprise turn around because the stronger player just trying to finish the other guy off makes some over-confident blunder. Which is why I when I'm losing I often like to play it out until I see for sure how the other guy can force checkmate... Speaking of which, how am I going to force checkmate here?

42) zoltar: Move R1 Different Grogar
zoltar: Have you every played shogi? It seems to me to be the best form of chess, combining the best things in chess with homeworlds but without the most annoying features of chess. I just figured out last week how to make a shogi set with 4 stashes of pyramids. I think it is better than the original, which has pieces with Japanese characters on them that initially turn people off of the game. It could be called "Martian Shogi".

TwoShort: I haven't played Shogi, though I've skimmed the rules at some point. It struck me as stylistically very much like chess. What do you see as it's advantages? My main problem with chess is that it's strategy has been analyzed so extensively; if I'm doing something weird and different that no one has tried before, it's because it's dumb. With Homeworlds it still might be brilliant :) And the aesthetics of the pyramids & boardlessness appeals as well.

53) TwoShort: Sacrifice Y2 Boar

zoltar: First, in Shogi there are no weird moves (pawn move and capture only 1 space forward, and you can't double them); second, pieces you capture can be dropped back in as your pieces. The orientations changing, as in homeworlds, gave me the idea to use pyramids. In chess, you simply trade down when ahead, to increase your ratio of material; in shogi, that doesn't work, as the pieces get recycled, so you have to do something very much like the 'factory' in homeworlds, where you drop in a pawn, promote it (to a 'tokin'), then trade the promoted pawn for a real piece; your opponent only gets a pawn to drop in his stash, whereas you get a piece. As it turns out, there are a lot more sacrifices for mate, as in homeworlds and the most exciting of chess games. Whereas in chess, where engames are boring and simplified and the goal is to get a past pawn and trade all your pieces so you can make a queen, in shogi the endgame is intense, complicated, and you have to go for actual checkmate to win. It's an amazing game, far superior to chess. Also, because the pieces are slower moving, you can't memorize set openings, and the advantage for the first player goes from 10% to 1%. I'd love to have a pyramid version of it here. I wonder how hard that would be? Do you know the guy that runs the site?

zoltar: Yes, I am toast. Can't sac my red or you just move your red in -- very clever.
zoltar: Nice finish!
