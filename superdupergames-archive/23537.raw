Homeworlds Online (SDG# 23537)
Started: 2013.3.20, Ended: 2013.4.24
Participants: ts52 (S), wil (N)
Winner: ts52

1) wil: Homeworld B2 R1 G3
	wil: Homeworld (b2, r1, g3)   what am I doing wrong, I have beentrying to start but it says no b2s
	ts52: Ah, no (), just: h b2 r1 g3

2) ts52: Homeworld R1 B3 G3
	wil: thanx, total newbie, thanx for your patience...where do I find these instructions??
	ts52: Instructions on SDG, or rules for Homeworld?
The different commands are listed at the top. Technically this is binary homeworlds, which is described here: http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Andy/Games/ILoveHomeworlds.html#BinaryHomeworlds and from there you can find the link to the official rules as well.

3) wil: Build G1 Wil
	ts52: Also, I'm happy to answer any questions, but SDG doesn't email me when there's a new comment. So if you want to ask a question, and get my attention, leave a comment, then make a move and undo it. That way I get email. :)

4) ts52: Build G1 Ts52
	wil: thx...still totaly confused...that nomenclature listed doesn't work... the short hand is what  was getting me...  like this one...adding one small green ship...  I did so many things I forgot what worked...is my star system called wil?   or N?  and how wil I name a new one when it is time?

	wil: if you can cut and paste your commands into a note, I'll be able to see what you wrote and how they responded... I see now it says mine is the wil system..

	ts52: Ok, I can do that. I See you figured out your homeworld is named after your username.

5) wil: Trade G1 Y1 Wil
	ts52: My first command was: h r1 b3 g3
My second command is: b g1 ts52
	ts52: My next command will likely be: t g1 y1 ts52
	ts52: But that depends on your next move. :)

	wil: yeah, seems like that is a standard move eh?  getting a yellow so you can move to a new star system in the future, and then growing another green so you can work toward a rainbow fleet of choices?   Is there anywhere written 'opening gambits' middle game scenarios, end game like chess?

6) ts52: Trade G1 Y1 Ts52

7) wil: Build G1 Wil
	ts52: I'm not sure how much of that is still on the web. Andy Looney wrote a lot about it, most of it is probably linked from the url I posted earlier. But you might check the SDG wiki as well.

8) ts52: Build G1 Ts52
	wil: thx, I'll check...

9) wil: Trade G1 B1 Wil
	ts52: this move: b g1 ts52

10) ts52: Trade G1 B1 Ts52
	wil: thx

11) wil: Build G1 Wil
	ts52: I think your getting the hang of it.
my move: t g1 b1 ts52
Soon you're going to want to discover a new system. You do that with a command like: d b1 wil g3 big_green
	wil: big_green is the name of the system...you just pick a name correct?

12) ts52: Discover B1 Ts52 G2 Kermit
	wil: all ok?
	ts52: That's right, names can be anything. Sorry, lost my email reminding me it was my turn.

13) wil: Build G1 Wil

14) ts52: Build G1 Ts52
	ts52: Also, be careful having 3 pieces of the same color in the same system. 4 pieces of the same color == catastrophe.
