	mneme: It doesn't really matter.

s y3 doh
  m y1 doh calliope
  m y1 nored calliope
  m y1 nored calliope
  c yellow calliope
 
You couldn't move, and I could take your b2 at home...
But I agree, it doesn't really matter.
	mneme: It didn't, because my next move is to trade for a y3 which I could then use to finish up the kill after the capture.  But yeah, it would have slowed things down for a turn.
