Homeworlds Online (SDG# 36162)

Participants: Babamots (S), Pib (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) Pib: Homeworld G1 B1 Y3 *
	Babamots: Some players have suggested that, when abandoning your homeworld, it should make a difference whether your enemy has any ships in your homeworld.
 
Some say that you shouldn't be allowed to temporarily abandon your homeworld unless your enemy has ships there (SDG allows it either way).
 
I've also been asked whether an enemy presence in your home makes a difference to whether you may abandon it while simultaneously eliminating your opponent. I am quite certain that SDG does not allow simultaneous elimination under any circumstances, but we'll try it out.

Catastrophe Pib Y
	Babamots: But Pib was able to commit suicide by catastrophe when I had no ships at their home. So, it seems that SDG will let you commit suicide, but ONLY when your opponent does NOT have any ships at your home.
	Pib: Having this as a rated game was an accident. Sorry!
