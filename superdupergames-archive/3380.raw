Homeworlds Online (SDG# 3380)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2006.5.5, Ended: 2006.5.21
Participants: Keith (S), TwoShort (N)
Winner: TwoShort

1) TwoShort: Homeworld Y1 B3 G3
	TwoShort: Well, at least I think I like expounding in unrated games... the one I just started vs. GeepaMoogle is the first unrated game I've played.
	TwoShort: So anyway, expounding: always start with a green or yellow ship.  I prefer green, and I think it's easier for beginners, but some quite good players (e.g. Andy Looney) prefer yellow, and do quite well with it.  One of your stars should be blue; last week I would have said the other should definitely be green or yellow (whichever your ship isn't), but then Jesse started a game against me with it red, and I can see the potential (actually having red is of minor benefit; being able to have more yellow & green ships without aproaching catastrophe is the real advantage.)

2) Keith: Homeworld Y2 B1 G3
	TwoShort: Oh, and sizes: the ship should be a 3 pointer, for the stars I'd normally take a 1 & 2 (I'm being nice, and letting you); typically I'd be taking the 1 & 3 because I was going second and my opponent took 1 & 2.  It's mainly about what you're moving to;  moving to three points gives you a bit of control over their availability; moving to one points can be limiting when they disappear fast.
	TwoShort: You could of course also take 1 & 3 for a "small universe" game, or two twos to make us immediately ajacent.  But that is widely considered not as much fun, and a disadvantage for the second player in any case.

3) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort
	Keith: Thank you for accepting my challenge.  It was your expounding comment in your unrated game with GeepaMoogle that gave me the idea.  
 
I saw that Jesse took red and your comment about it but whatever advanced player advantage it offers is beyond my understanding.  
 
I have only reached my second turn in my only other Homeworld game so I have no sense yet for one pointer depletion speed and game impact.  I will take your setup advice and the opportunity for a 1 & 2 homeworld.
	TwoShort: build g1 twoshort

4) Keith: Build G1 Keith
	TwoShort: Someday I'll stop typing orders in the wrong field...  Anyway, here in the early game, we'll both be building and expanding outward.  The things to think about are color monopolies and 3 pointers.  If all the pieces of one color are gone from the stash, and you don't have any as ships, it will be a problem.  If it happens with yellow, it will be crippling.  Assuming neither of us allows that to happen, the big deal will be who gets more three pointers when they become available.  
	Keith: Well at this point I can only build green.  Can't see trading it or I would have started with that color.  Can't move the g3 and would not want to.
	Keith: I can see how you would type your order into the comment field.  I just started to.  I think it is because of the game board.  The order input box is way far away.

5) TwoShort: Trade G1 Y1 Twoshort

6) Keith: Trade G1 Y1 Keith
	TwoShort: Yeah, the first turn is pretty much always the same: grow another of whatever your initial ship is.  
	TwoShort: Trying to monopolize colors or get 3 pointers are sort of medium-term goals, but the groundwork for them starts coming into play pretty quickly.  For example: if I had grown another green 1 point, you could get a green 2 point; not huge deal, but certainly better for you than me.  By flipping to yellow, there is only one yellow one point left; if you let me take it, you can't get yellow except by growing to a two point and using blue before I'm able to take both two points, or by flipping your 3 point to yellow and building without letting me get one more yellow into your homeworld to cause a catastrophe; all in all, it will be a pain; so I'd recommend taking the 1 point :) 
	Keith: Given game lengths averaging 17 turns development would have to be fast.  It would seem to be much easier to get a yelllow one point than to wait and see if I get a two pointer in time.

7) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

8) Keith: Discover Y1 Keith G3 Maruko
	Keith: Lets see if I can complicate the potential factory.

9) TwoShort: Discover Y1 Twoshort G2 Grogar

10) Keith: Build Y2 Maruko
	TwoShort: Well, in the factory, you sacrifice a G3 to grow two other peices, then re-grow the same g3 you sacrificed.  
	TwoShort: So moving your yellow to a g3 doesn't really impact it dierectly (though it's a fine move in any case)
	Keith: Ahh.  I was thinking no g3 in the pool no factory.  So if my understanding is correct then sacrificing a y3 puts a y3 in the pool that stays and the same for r3.  The down side of the sacrifice is a window of piece opportunity for your opponent.  A b3 could be pulled back out of the pool but it is a limited cycle process as a 3-pointer is lost every cycle.  However, a g3 sacrifice cycle can be repeated as long as a player wants. 

11) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

12) Keith: Discover Y1 Maruko B2 Nikos
	TwoShort: Yes, sacrifice anything and it immediately goes into the stash.  Ditto if you move or sacrifice the last ship at a system: the system immediately goes into the stash.  This is what enables the factory, and also the "investment", where you sacrifice a green that is the only ship at it's (generally Y3) system to immediately grow the system as a ship.

13) TwoShort: Discover G1 Twoshort B2 Bluestar

14) Keith: Build G1 Keith
	TwoShort: So I imagine you did that so you would have more room to grow yellow at Maruko, which is a fine idea.  but that ship isn't doing much for you back at your homeworld.  Moving to a new g2 or b2 would probably be a better choice.  Growing another green at your homeworld should probably also be on your agenda for this turn or next.
	Keith: My concern for growing a new green anywhere is hastening the start of your factory effort.  I take it the advantage of a new g2 system is that is is adjacent to your homeworld.  A new system did not occur to me at all.  In retrospect I think a b2 would fit the ideas I had in mind better.  Would there have been a difference between discovering a new g2 and moving to grogar?
	TwoShort: Feel free to undo if you want.  I'd probably move to a b2, but even if you move to a g2 it will be a few turns at least before I can safely factory.  Moving to Grogar doesn't sound so good; you don't have anything you can flip to red right now, while I do and would get the first chance anyway.  You could always run away if I did, but why give me the initiative in deciding when/whether to force that?  Really, in your shoes, rather than worrying about delaying my factory, I'd make sure your own factory is set up and ready to go.
	TwoShort: The advantage of moving to a two (green or blue) is not so much that it's ajacent to my homeworld (though there is nothing wron gwith that), but that it is not your homeworld.  Having the y1 at your homeworld does nothing, because you already hve yellow access there.  As soon as I have a y2 you won't want to have 3 yellows there, so you can't grow more yellow there.  When we start with the factories, you'll want to have as many places to grow as you can.
	Keith: I feel a bit a awkward taking the move back because the need is based on my event horizon being only one or two ply so that a one ply screen update makes a difference.  I will do so since the game is unrated and it is okay with you.
 
BTW thank you for all the advice.  The game is starting to make sense.  Elements of play like ship creation restrictions, the immediate availability of a sacrificed piece, investments and factories

15) TwoShort: Build G2 Bluestar

16) Keith: Sacrifice G3 Keith
Build G2 Keith
Build G3 Keith
Build Y2 Nikos
	TwoShort: My theory on undo generally is that if the opponent doesn't want you to undo, they should make a move.  For this game, I figure the idea is to have an instructive game; if you make a move I'm sure is a bad idea, I'll encourage you to undo.  If you make a move that seems reasonble, but not quite what I'd do, I'll tell you so, then try to take advantage of the opening.

17) TwoShort: Build Y3 Grogar

18) Keith: Trade G2 B2 Keith
	Keith: I guess I will stick my neck out.

19) TwoShort: Trade G2 R2 Bluestar
	TwoShort: Well, I can't get a green to your homeworld to cause a catastrophe, so you're safe this turn.  But after this turn I'll be able to, so you'll have to spend your next turn dealing with it.

20) Keith: Build Y3 Maruko
	Keith: I thought I was probably safe for one turn but was not sure I was seeing all of your possibilities.  I was not sure whether to convert a green to a blue before taking a factory turn or after.  I decided it would be better to grab the G2 and that you would be limited to adding only on yellow in Grogar.  Though it was a Y3.

21) TwoShort: Move Y3 Grogar Maruko
	TwoShort: I'm not sure the factory was a bad move, or what I would have done instead.  But I consider 3 poiters, particularly yellow ones, to be supremely valuable, so in my opinion the real question is what becomes of the other two.  I can't safely grow them this turn, or outright stop you from growing at least one, so I'll look for ways to mess with you if you do, and maybe get the last one.

22) Keith: Trade Y2 R2 Nikos
	TwoShort: And now I should mention the gun rule: If your opponent draws their gun, draw your gun.  It's very risky to not have a red ship when your opponent has one, because they can move into a system, and get the first shot.  Ocasionally you can get away with it briefly, and I actually ignore the gun rule more frequently than most, but I often regret it.
	Keith: I dfinately feel under the gun but I want that y3.

23) TwoShort: Move Y3 Maruko Nikos
	TwoShort: Exactly the sort of reason I sometimes ignore the rule... now let's see if I can make you regret it :)

24) Keith: Move R2 Nikos Maruko
	Keith: I expect that you can.  Even more so if I misstep on this move.
	Keith: I could convert my b2 to a r2.  If you moved the y1 from grogar to Maruko we would both lose y3's and the system link to my homeworld would be eliminated.
	Keith: If you sacrificed your R2 unit, afterall I don't have a gun, then you could convert my Y3 in Maruko couldn't you?  That is more of a rules operation question than a tactical one since I could then move a Y1 in and trigger a catastrophe.
	TwoShort: If I sacrifice the r2, I could take both your peices at Maruko.  If you don't get a red or cause the catastrophe, I'll probably move the y3 into your homeworld, in which case I'll either win, or at least completely cripple you.  So you definitely want to do one of the two. I'm not sure which is better though.  For what it's worth, the system link to your homeworld is pretty irrelevant, as long as there are 3s in the stash, your're reachable.
	Keith: Given that Discover is a seperate command from Move, Attack, Build and Trade I was not sure if you could build a link and move through on the same turn.  I will need to keep in mind that, just like a ship can move more than once from a sacrifice it can attack more than once.

25) TwoShort: Build G2 Bluestar

26) Keith: Move Y3 Maruko Bluestar

27) TwoShort: Sacrifice Y3 Nikos
Discover G2 Bluestar Y3 Larry
Discover G1 Bluestar B3 Moe
Discover R2 Bluestar B3 Curly

28) Keith: Move R2 Maruko Grogar

29) TwoShort: Sacrifice G3 Twoshort
Build G2 Larry
Build Y2 Grogar
Build G3 Twoshort

30) Keith: Attack Y2 Grogar
	Keith: Well that certainly explains what you would do if I walzed a 3 pointer in among three smaller ships and threatend to convert two.
	Keith: I suppose it also puts you in a good position to crank a factory given only one piece per system.  Was such a dispersion part of your plan all along?
	TwoShort:  I didn't like the situation, so I figured I'd make big changes :)  Generally, I rarely have a definite plan.  I look for various things I could do over the course of a few turns that would be good for me or bad for you, but then I try to find the moves that produce the most different posibilities.  I think of it as trying to threaten to do more things thatn you can counter.
	TwoShort: So even now, I don't know what those ships are going to do at the 3 points, but: If you keep up the chase with your big yellow, there is only one at each system; being spread out is nice if I want to factory; if I get a big yellow again (which I'll be eager to) the greens could move in for a disaster; if you use your red, the red could move in and cause trouble; Either of the greens might at some point be able to serve as an investment.  
	Keith: I can't see galavanting around after single ships.  BlueStar was the only sector with the density to make a try worthwhile.  Not sure what to do now and my work schedule is taking away my free time for a while.

31) TwoShort: Sacrifice G3 Twoshort
Build Y3 Grogar
Build G3 Twoshort
Build R1 Curly

32) Keith: Move Y2 Maruko Grogar
Catastrophe Grogar Yellow
	Keith: If my understanding of the rules is correct I could use the r2 in grogar to convert the y2.  It might not be good strategy but I could.
	TwoShort: Well, I'm not entirely sure what you should do now, but I'm kind of short on yellow, so keeping it that way is probably a good idea, and moving you red to grogar was a fine way to pursue that.  I could have just run away, but this seemd more fun: I've set up the green catastrophe threat if you let me sacrifice the y2, so I assume you'll take it; then I'll grow the y3; then you'll move in from maruko to cause a catastrophe, and those yellows will be back in the stash and maybe I can get some.  Of course, I think the results of that little script are slightly in your favor, so if I see something better, I'll do that instead; as might you...
	Keith: I see you could move the two g2s at Larry to Keith to create a disaster.  With the y2. No y3 required.
	Keith: It is tempting to sacrifice my g3 and grow it back pluse the y3 and a b1 or r1.  But then your two g2s...

33) TwoShort: Trade R2 Y2 Curly

34) Keith: Move G1 Keith Larry

35) TwoShort: Sacrifice G3 Twoshort
Build G3 Twoshort
Build G3 Moe
Build Y1 Curly
	TwoShort: Just to keep the pressure on...

36) Keith: Move Y3 Bluestar Larry
	Keith: Hopefully that was a good idea.  It seems to leave you far away from a y3.  I am worried about your factory.  You can get another g3 but I could not safely get it.
	Keith: You are making your moves so fast I am sure I am walking into a mess you see coming but that I do not.

37) TwoShort: Trade G3 R3 Moe
	TwoShort: Not really... It took me a while to think through growing instead of running away from your red a few moves back; since then things have gone about as I expected.  I hadn't thought that last move out ahead, but I knew I wanted some yellow, and to keep threatening the green catastrophe.  The mess I see coming is that I'm going to disable your factory; either by catastrophe, or by what you'll have to do to prevent it...
	TwoShort: So, for example, it never occured to me you'd do that...


38) Keith: Build G3 Larry
Catastrophe Larry Green
	TwoShort: Funny you should mention my making moves fast... I'm sitting here saying "Isn't this a tutorial game? I'm having to think entirely too hard for that." :)
	Keith: Well thank you.  Blame the teacher.  
 
Yeah well ships are options and you are fast out optioning me.  Which I seem to remember you did somewhere else against a heavy duty player.

39) TwoShort: Move Y2 Curly Keith

40) Keith: Build R1 Grogar
	Keith: There seems to be so many possibilities.  Grow a g3 in Keith... no then two g2s move and catastrophe.  Grow a g3 in Larry and create a catastrophe and maybe delay more factory action with all the greens in the stash.  Convert your two greens in Larry but then I have no gun and easy catastrophe.  Hmmmm...

41) TwoShort: Sacrifice G1 Moe
Build Y2 Keith
	TwoShort: Good choice; at least compared to using your red, because if you did I would be free to move my red into your homeworld.  Which is why I was wanting to factory up another g3 I could move in to force you to use up your red, but now you shut down the factory...  So now I've got to think of a plan B...
	TwoShort: Well, there's a thought...


42) Keith: Trade Y1 G1 Nikos
	Keith: And at first impression I don't get it.  It does place two yellow elements in my homeworld.
	TwoShort: Well, as noted before, if you sacrifice your red before getting another, you're doomed.  So next turn I can grow another yellow, and the turn after that I can move in the y1 from curly for the catastrophe, destroying one of your homeworld stars.
	TwoShort: or I could sacrifice my r1 to take your b2, and start growing toward both disasters.
	Keith: It is tempting to sacrifice the g3 and grow a y2 at Larry, y3 at Nikos and an r1 at Grogar.  Partly because it gives me a second red ship but mostly because it takes the y3 you enjoy so much out of the stash.  But no three pointer in my home world and your r3 moves in with the same effect as if I had no r2.  Tricky.
	Keith: Sooner or later one of my "try this and see if I have overlooked something" is going to cost me dearly.  

43) TwoShort: Trade G1 R1 Twoshort
	TwoShort: Looks good to me; you still lose the star, but I don't think that was avoidable.

44) Keith: Build G1 Nikos

45) TwoShort: Trade R3 G3 Moe
	TwoShort: Clever idea! But I thought of it too :) 

46) Keith: Build G1 Nikos
	Keith: As it was your only real vulnerability it was worth a try.

47) TwoShort: Sacrifice G3 Moe
Build Y1 Keith
Build R2 Twoshort
Build Y3 Curly

48) Keith: Sacrifice Y3 Larry
Move R1 Grogar Twoshort
Move G1 Nikos Twoshort
Move G1 Nikos Twoshort

49) TwoShort: Sacrifice R2 Twoshort
Attack R1S Twoshort
Attack B2S Keith

50) Keith: Build G2 Twoshort
Catastrophe Twoshort Green
	Keith: Which I have done in my other learning game with CDRoddefer (which is many many turns less developed than this one)
	Keith: Though I like your slow factory idea.  Create a 3-pointer, convert it to green, then a one turn factory.
	Keith: I think it is all down hill form here for me.  I am going to try something wild - the most likely result will be accelrating the end.

51) TwoShort: Trade Y3 G3 Curly
	TwoShort: I think it's downhill for you unless I screw up. You're doing an excellent job of giving me oportunities to screw up...  This one will take a bit of figuring.
	TwoShort: Definitely a lot of ways to get this wrong.. OK I think I've got it.

52) Keith: Sacrifice R2 Grogar
Attack B2 Keith
Attack Y2 Keith
	TwoShort: By the way, I assume you're aware that you can cause the yellow catastrophe in your own system any time (as can I).  I'm not saying you should, but it might not have occurred to you.  I haven't just because I can any time, and didn't want to bring you closer yet.
	Keith: Hmmm... shoulda moved the r2 into TwoShort.  I was hoping to sacrifice my G3 and grow some red and green ships and create a double catasrophy.

53) TwoShort: Sacrifice R1 Curly
Attack B2S Keith
Catastrophe Keith Yellow
	TwoShort: I could have traded the g3 to yellow or blue if forced to.  Still, you can blow up green, and then I'll have no 3 point in my homeworld if you can get some yellow and move the r2 in...  but that's assuming you can avoid your own double catastrophe this turn.

	TwoShort: Anyway, excellent game!  Your rate of improvement was quite impressive; by the end here I felt like I had a real fight on my hands, despite having taken advantage of your inexperience in the early game.
	Keith: Thank you for the lessons and the positive feedback.  I am glad I was able to make you work for it a little near the end.  Right now I have a tough time seeing very far ahead but I have learned a lot of things to look out for.  ...I'll be back.
