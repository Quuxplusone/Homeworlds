Participants: Felix (S), MobyNostromo (N)
Winner: Felix

1) MobyNostromo: Homeworld B1 G2 Y3
	MobyNostromo: Hi. This is my first time playing, and the wiki is down. Can you help me with the notation?

2) Felix: Homeworld B2 R3 G3
	Draw5PlayAll: What do you need?
 
Also, change games/homeworlds to games:homeworlds in the wiki URL and that should work.
	MobyNostromo: Aha!! I found it. Thank you., and thank you for waiting for my move. I'm good, you can make your move.
	Felix: I guess Draw5 beat me to the advice. But I'm happy to help you with the notation and give you tips as we play. One cool thing to remember is that you don't have to type out the full word of the notation. "b g1 MobyNostromo" would work just as well as "build g1 MobyNostromo." Saves a bit of time!

3) MobyNostromo: Build Y1 Mobynostromo

4) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	MobyNostromo: Hi Felix. Thanks for the clarification. I'm very curious about this game, but I'm afraid I'm not going to give you a very good game.
	Felix: No problem! I'm always happy to help a beginner learn. It's a wonderful game so I hope you'll learn to love it. Don't worry about doing super wlel on your first game. It took me a solid 10-20 games to really start to wrap my head around the strategy of it.

5) MobyNostromo: Build Y1 Mobynostromo
	MobyNostromo: Knowing the little I know of it, I think I'm going to like this one. I know I'm going to blow this game (and the next ten or twenty).
	MobyNostromo: And thanks for the help!!
	MobyNostromo: I'm not getting the proper codes. I wanted to discover a new system with my Y1. What should I right for the next move?

6) Felix: Trade G1 Y1 Felix
	Felix: To discover a new system you would type "d y1 MobyNostromo" plus the size/color of the new system and the name of the new system. So if you wanted to discover a g3 with your y1 you would type "d y1 MobyNostromo g3 system1" for instance. But you can name it whatever you want.
 
I hope that helps!

Catastrophe Alpha Blue

27) MobyNostromo: M R2 Alpha Out
	MobyNostromo: I had a dire feeling something was in the works. Something "catastrophic."

28) Felix: Sacrifice R2 Felix
Attack R2 Out
Pass
	Felix: Hehehe, always gotta watch out for those catastrophes, but it can be very difficult to recognize the threats sometimes.

29) MobyNostromo: B Y1 Alpha
	Felix: Also, watch out for the remote attack ability on a sacrifice, like I just did!
	MobyNostromo: I completely forgot about that. There's a lot to this game! I think I'm going to like this one at least a lot.

30) Felix: Build Y2 Out
	Felix: It's my favorite game, even better than chess. The rules are simple but the possibilities are extremely complex!

31) MobyNostromo: B Y2 Mobynostromo
	MobyNostromo: Though I know very little at this point, I can see it supplanting games like Chess.

32) Felix: Build Y3 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: I doubt the rules are simple... but the possibilities are very IDIC (infinite diversity in infinite combinations).

33) MobyNostromo: T Y2 B2 Mobynostromo
	Felix: @Draw5 - I meant compared with chess. Only four piece types, one type of movement, one type of attack, etc. Pretty simple, really.
	Draw5PlayAll: Four piece types? I say 12 or 24!
	Felix: How do you figure? Different sizes, sure, but the same action types.
	MobyNostromo: It seems to me to encapsulate pretty elegant rules within so many possible outcomes, it can become an incredible brain-burner. Then again, my two cents at this point is worth about that much - two cents.

34) Felix: Build B1 Ridge

35) MobyNostromo: M B2 Mobynostromo Alpha
	Draw5PlayAll: Inflation...
	MobyNostromo: Ha, ha! Those are two expensive cents.
