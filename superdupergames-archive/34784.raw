	Mathematician42: oh

	Mathematician42: I'm pretty much screwed here.... right?
	Trydnt: you can't have more than 3 of a color in the same place or they are destroyed via catastrophe
	Trydnt: check out Looney Labs youtube tutorial on the game
	Trydnt: on youtube
	Mathematician42: I know. I always forget that rule
	Trydnt: it's probably the most important rule of the game as it's how most good games end with catastrophe on both halves of your opponent's homeworld. winning via attack or wiping out your opponents ships at home does happen but less often
