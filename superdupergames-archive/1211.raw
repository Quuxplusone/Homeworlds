CDRodeffer: No problem! Just pop the live-CD in your drive and turn it on to try things out. Or use a school computer if you have any reservations. And no, that is not my insidious attempt to infect a certain university with some evil destructive program from some certain other university.... :-)

31) benedict: Move Y1 Pons Eden

32) CDRodeffer: Attack R1 Ohio_state
benedict: I have to admit I have no idea what I'm doing
CDRodeffer: No problem. Let's assess your situation. You have a few ships out there, but not many big ones yet. That's about the same for me, too. A conflict-oriented direct invasion strategy usually doesn't work in this game. It's just too hard and takes too many turns to move in ships and then fight. If your opponent has a red ship and a large ship at home, they can always defend against a single ship of any size. More likely, many ships are moved in at once using a sacrifice of a large yellow. Or many ships are grown at once somewhere by sacrificing a large green. Or, more often in outside systems, many ships are attacked by sacrificing a large red. Less frequent, several ships can be traded at a time, but that's usually a defensive rather than an offensive move.

33) benedict: Move R2 Eden Pons
benedict: that last move of mine was a mistake - forgot that having a red star system allowed you to attack.

43) benedict: Build R3 Pons
CDRodeffer: This scheme of sacrificing a g3, then immediately rebuilding it as one of the actions it allows requires another green ship (in this case my g1 at CDRodeffer). This construction is popularly known as "the factory."
benedict: nasty

CDRodeffer: You're not gonna like this....

47) benedict: Build R1 Benedict
benedict: i sensed the fact that you were rubbing your internet hands together with glee, but didn't realize exactly what would happen - I took the bait and walked right into the trap@!!@

48) CDRodeffer: Sacrifice B1 Jealousy
Trade R1 Y1 Ohio_state

49) benedict: Trade R2 G2 Benedict
CDRodeffer: No, not so much that, as I saw the opportunity and just took it. The large yellow ship is useful for the "invade and catastrophe" type of attack, but sometimes a medium will do. Seldom will a player leave a system vulnerable to a single ship invasion catastrophe.

50) CDRodeffer: Build G1 Ohio_state
benedict: by the way, I never really congratulated you on having your game pulling strings online - that's one step ahead of me ;) well done! I'm about to play Iain Cheyne in that one...
CDRodeffer: Thanks! I hope you like the game. Pulling Strings is really simple, and sort of just fell together almost completely formed.

benedict: I told you, I still have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing...
benedict: ...I just know that I am losing horribly
CDRodeffer: That's OK. Sometime we'll get together over the board, and I'll show you some things. Actually, I'm not really the one to show you -- there are many much better players than I. But you're right, this is the end. Nice game, even so.
