Winner: MrStickman

1) Evilaxe: Homeworld Y2 B1 G3
	MrStickman: Hiya. I don't think I've actually played Homeworlds since it was called IceTraders. I hope you don't mind me using this game to try and remember how it works...
	Evilaxe: No problem. My only experience is from reading the rules/wiki and about 3 moves into another game.

2) MrStickman: Homeworld B3 G2 Y3

3) Evilaxe: Build G1 Evilaxe

4) MrStickman: Build Y1 Mrstickman
	MrStickman: Heh. Why am I now picturing veteran players popping in and saying things like "Gah!" or "<slaps forehead>?"

5) Evilaxe: Trade G1 Y1 Evilaxe

6) MrStickman: Trade Y1 B1 Mrstickman

7) Evilaxe: Build G1 Evilaxe
	MrStickman: I just realized that the old "enlarge a ship" action from IceTraders went away. Ouch.

8) MrStickman: Build Y1 Mrstickman
	Evilaxe: I've not played IceTraders, but I did spend a few minutes looking through the rules for 'How do I upgrade my ships?'
	MrStickman: Clearly, getting large ships is much much harder now. Cool.

14) MrStickman: Trade B1 G1 Mrstickman
	Evilaxe: Damn, now that was a bad move. 
	MrStickman: Um, mine or yours? (And I wonder if Aaron will ever put in an Undo function, perhaps only to be used by mutual consent of all players...)
	MrStickman: Oh. I just figured that out. Oops.

15) Evilaxe: Trade Y1 G1 Evilaxe
	Evilaxe: I as referring to me. That move of mine just took green tech out of my hands, so I now have to waste a turn reaquiring it.

	Evilaxe: Yeah. I think you got the best of it, but I don't really have enough experience to judge.

36) MrStickman: Move G3 Mrstickman Ipsum
	MrStickman: There was a big risk on my part. If you'd had a yellow to sacrifice, you could've rushed my Homeworld and caused a catastrophe.

	Evilaxe: Doesn't really matter though.
	Evilaxe: Actually, and if you don't want to I won't hold it against you, but could you pass next turn?
 
I promise I'll then just change one of the B2s in Sindern to a G3, emulating what I was trying to do, but absent-mindedly input wrong.
 
Of course, feel perfectly free not to if you don't want to.
	Evilaxe: I mean G2

49) Evilaxe: Trade B2 G2 Sindern
	MrStickman: A piece of me just breated a sigh of relief. "Finally, a turn I don't have to think about."
