	stoneaxe: The image is gone for me too.  I noticed it disappeared after my last move (the trade).
	stoneaxe: feel free to make a move and then undo it to see if that fixes it...  I could try to undo my last one too.  Just a thought...
	jeep: I'll be traveling tomorrow.  Please don't unfreeze it tomorrow.  ;)  When I get to my destination on Monday, I'll see about setting up the game so I know the stash contents without having to figure it out repeatedly.
