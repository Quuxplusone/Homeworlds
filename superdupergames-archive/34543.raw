Started: 2018.9.6, Ended: 2018.9.17
Participants: eliscinsky (S), Babamots (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) Babamots: Homeworld B3 G1 Y3
	Babamots: For the record, this is a practice game and not part of the ongoing tournament.

2) eliscinsky: Homeworld R1 B2 G3
	eliscinsky: Understood & Agreed. Thanks for the rematch!

3) Babamots: Build Y1 Babamots

4) eliscinsky: Build G1 Eliscinsky

5) Babamots: Trade Y1 G1 Babamots
	eliscinsky: I see the advantage of your HW. Nice.

6) eliscinsky: B G2 Eliscinsky
	Babamots: What do you see as the advantage of my homeworld? I deliberately took a setup that I consider a bit weak.
	eliscinsky: The ability to build y quickly, and gain larges soon. Or am I missing something?

7) Babamots: Build G2 Babamots
	Babamots: It's true that starting with a yellow ship gives me a bit of a head start on getting yellows, but I think it slows down my overall expansion a bit. Here's my theory: in order to expand rapidly, you want to either get a blue ship in a green system or vice versa (in order to create many-colored ships closer to your enemy than your home is). If you're focused on gathering yellow, you're slower to get blue and green together in a forward system.

8) eliscinsky: Trade G2 Y2 Eliscinsky

12) eliscinsky: B G2 Trill

13) Babamots: Build Y1 Babamots

14) eliscinsky: Trade G1 Y1 Trill

15) Babamots: Move Y1 Babamots Cardassia

16) eliscinsky: Build G1 Eliscinsky

19) Babamots: Trade Y1 R1 Cardassia

20) eliscinsky: Build G2 Trill

21) Babamots: Build G3 Bajor

22) eliscinsky: Sacrifice Y2 Eliscinsky
Move G2 Trill Bajor
Move G2 Trill Bajor
Catastrophe Bajor Green

23) Babamots: Build R1 Cardassia
	Babamots: Unfortunately, if you build a g3 now in either of your systems, I can catastrophe it in a good exchange for me.
If you build at home:
sacrifice y3 Babamots
move g1 Bajor Trill
move g1 Trill eliscinsky
move g3 Cardassia Babamots
catastrophe eliscinsky g
	eliscinsky: Yes, I figured I should watch out for that.  That's why I figured I'd do ...

24) eliscinsky: T Y2 R2 Eliscinsky

25) Babamots: Build Y1 Cardassia

26) eliscinsky: M Y1 Trill Eliscinsky
	Babamots: By building the last r1 piece, I'm trying to force you to trade your y2 for r2. That will limit your ability to build more yellow.
 
You could also trade your g3 for r3, but it's nice to have smaller red pieces in case you need to sacrifice for a single attack.
 
Failing to have red ships while my opponent has them is pretty high on that list of danger signs I sent you. But I won't attack yet since the only ship I could come after is your y1, which can just run away.

27) Babamots: Build Y2 Cardassia

28) eliscinsky: Build Y2 Eliscinsky

29) Babamots: Discover Y2 Cardassia Y3 Iconia

30) eliscinsky: D R2 Eliscinsky Y3 Trill

31) Babamots: Build Y2 Babamots

32) eliscinsky: M G1 Eliscinsky Trill

33) Babamots: Build G1 Cardassia
	Babamots: I discovered a y3 system to keep the piece away from you. My hope is to sacrifice my g2 to build the remaining y2 and y3. You can block me in a couple of ways.

34) eliscinsky: B G2 Eliscinsky

35) Babamots: Move G1 Cardassia Iconia

36) eliscinsky: B G2 Trill

37) Babamots: Build G3 Cardassia

38) eliscinsky: Build R2 Trill

39) Babamots: Build G3 Iconia

40) eliscinsky: D R2 Trill B2 Betazed

41) Babamots: Sacrifice Y3 Babamots
Move G1 Iconia Eliscinsky
Move G2 Cardassia Iconia
Move G2 Iconia Eliscinsky
Catastrophe Eliscinsky G

42) eliscinsky: Trade Y2 R2 Eliscinsky
	Babamots: I didn't foresee this problem for you last night. Since I have a factory in Cardassia, I can still build the g3 even after your partial block. If I do that, you'll be able to sacrifice your y2 to use your g1 for a green catastrophe in Iconia, but looking at it from this moment, you're losing a y2 and a g1 to kill my g1 (after which, I'll build that y2 piece, and you'll have an even more serious yellow shortage).
 
All that to say, you may want to undo. I have to go for now, but I'll look for a better move for you this afternoon.

43) Babamots: Move G3 Iconia Eliscinsky
	eliscinsky: Thanks. I've seen many issues with my available options.  Have to go back to a longer chess like game.  BTW, what do you think of my last move?
	Babamots: When you say "last move," I guess you mean building an r2. It gives you another medium ship without making large ones available to me, so I think it's pretty good.
 
If you now spread out your reds (mine are sill in the same system together), you're a bit better prepared to compete for the large red pieces. You're going to want another large ship soon to defend Trill before I decide to move a large there to attack.

44) eliscinsky: M R2 Trill Cardassia
	eliscinsky: That's what I was thinking. D r2 ....

45) Babamots: Attack R2 Eliscinsky
	eliscinsky: BTW, I really appreciate all the help and training. 
	Babamots: Well, I hope I help some. I don't feel like a great teacher when I usually realize what you should have done *after* you do something else. Maybe I like winning too much :-P
	Babamots: Here's a little quiz: what would you do if I moved my g3 to Trill?
	eliscinsky: In any competition there is usually one winner and one loser.  If I lose, I try to learn something from the loss.  So NP if you win. ;)
 
So now you Move G3 Cardassia Trill ... I could:
 
1) Move G2 eliscinsky Trill, Catastrophe Trill Green ... or ...
 
2) Sacrifice G3 Eliscinsky, Build R2 Trill, Build R3 Betazed, Build G3 eliscinsky (if I build an R3 in Trill you'll just attach it with your G3 by sacrificing one of your R1's. Good return.) ... or ...
 
3) Move R2 Trill eliscinsky, & allow you to sacrifice your 2 R's to attach my G's in Trill, then Move G2 eliscinsky Trill, Catastrophe Trill Green - plus the Y3 will also be freed up.  Meanwhile Trade G2 R2 eliscisnky, then Discover R2 eliscinsky R3 Romulus ... or ...
 
4) Move R2 Trill Betazed, but it would get stuck there, as I don't want to give up my Yellow.
 
 
Moving R2 Trill Cardassia ... does me no good as you'd just attach and take the R2 over.
Also at some point you're going to have to Trade for more Red.
If I allow you to take Trill by using your R1's, then I can try to snatch up all the Red, and once I have a R3 move it into you HW and attack.
Not sure what I'm going to do. I'm thinking it all over, trying to see if I missed anything.  For now #1 would seem the best option.
 
I seem to be one step behind to really make a move to put me into an advantage.
BTW, I'm feeling squeezed / penned in. Thanks ;)

	Babamots: Some good thoughts. Here are my thoughts to your thoughts.
 
1) You can do better than your first suggestion. Instead of moving the g2 with yellow, do what I call "green travel" to get your g2 to Trill (sacrifice and build), and then you have an extra green action to build an r2:
 
sacrifice g2 eliscinsky
build g2 Trill
build r2 Trill
catastrophe Trill g
 
2) I think this is your best move. You just ignore my threat and score a large ship. I would probably attack your r2, but then you could do the green catastrophe from suggestion 1).
 
3) Also pretty good. Escape with the one ship you wouldn't be able to catastrophe away after I attacked it. I don't understand the end of your continuation though. You would put an r2 ship in an r3 system?
 
4) I agree that this would solve the immediate problem but it doesn't get you much.
	eliscinsky: Ahhh, I still overlook those types of plays sometimes.
 
Also about your teaching ... If you can get your student to understand / comprehend / learn a new idea or method or way of thinking then you've done the job.  So to you I say "Well done".  You've most certainly grown my understanding of the game.
 
In fact, as most good students do, I was up half the night (2:30 & 4:00 am - couldn't sleep) thinking about HWs and what else I could do.  Then I saw your message, and thought about it a little more but finally got back to sleep. haha.
 
So it is your move.  Since I see other moves / strategy you could do, I'll await your next move.  Have you considered moving G's from Iconia to eliscinsky.  I'll either have to:
1) take your 1st G, but you 2nd would Catastrophe my G's. You'd have to get some Reds back but I think in the end you'd still win.  ... or ...
2) move my G or Y out but that will allow you to take my HW.  ( I think you're going to win anyway, but that's just me.;) )

	Babamots: I lost sleep in the last tournament rehearsing my opponent's anticipated moves and my responses. Stare at a position long enough and it will get stuck in your head. And that's not always bad. At least once, obsessive mental review made me realize I'd made a blunder that I was able to undo.
 
I never planned on moving my g3 to Trill, but since I have a large that *could* go there, it should have crossed your mind before you made your previous move. That's one of the "red flag" scenarios on the list I sent in our last game: "My opponent has a piece too large for me to attack in one of my systems." It was a good thought exercise.
 
I haven't really been looking for a killing blow yet, but now that I'm looking, it looks like you're right about it.
 
Based on this position and my own recent bad experience, I'm thinking about adding something to the red flag list: "Your only large in your home system is the same color as another ship/marker there."

46) eliscinsky: Sacrifice G2 Trill
Build Y2 Eliscinsky
Build R3 Cardassia
Catastrophe Cardassia Red
	Babamots: 1) If you build y3 in your home, I'll move my y2 there for a winning catastrophe.
2) If you sacrifice a yellow to move a ship to my home, I'll attack it and proceed with plan 3).
3) In all other cases, I plan to move my g3 to your home.
 
You have a move that will delay the game longer than my suggestions 1) or 2) would (though not for VERY long). Can you find it?
	eliscinsky: Aaarrrggghhhh! You distracted me! (not really) LOL!
 
Let's see ... not sure if this will work for me ... but ...

47) Babamots: Sacrifice R2 Eliscinsky
Attack Y1 Eliscinsky
Attack Y2 Eliscinsky
	Babamots: I was going to suggest getting a green ship to your home, preferably by trading, say "trade y1 g1 eliscinsky." Then, if I move in my g3, you can catastrophe it by building two more greens by sacrificing your g2 in Trill. It's a high price, but it would have delayed the game a bit more.

	eliscinsky: Had I traded my Y2 for a B2 in eliscinsky we might have a very different game. 
 
Gasping for breath!!! LOL
	eliscinsky: Nope, guess I couldn't have done that, but was there a g2, or just left it alone.  
	eliscinsky: UNCLE!!!
	Babamots: I'll let your remaining troops love if they surrender. 
	Babamots: I'll also let them live.
