	riddick: Crap! If you think about it, I think you win this next turn. Think planetary sacrifice....
	riddick: Actually -- maybe I'm still safe -- for some reason I though you could sacrifice system markers, but I guess it's only ships.

26) johannz: Build Y1 Gateway
	johannz: Not sure why you thought I could win this turn, even with planetary sacrifice. Don't have enough green close enough.
But I can seriously weaken you.
Build y1 in gateway
sacrifice y2 in gateway, move b1 through nomansland into riddick
sacrifice g3 in gateway, build 2 b's in riddick, catastrope blue (including planets) in riddick, build y1 in gateway.
Now riddick is a y1 system, and directly accessible from my home world.
You still have some easy options to prevent this.

	riddick: You the man! I think at this point I'd just be creating ships that you'll then attach until you can catastrophe the whole system. I bow before you're interplanetary prowess!!
