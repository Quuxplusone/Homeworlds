TwoShort: Hmm, we'll see. Against the particular homeworld set up you picked, I feel compelled to yet again attempt my wacky "Blue freeze-out" opening, which I like becaus it's different, and seems like it should be effective. My record with it so far has been considerably less than stellar though.
antihero: It is wacky. After a beating at Keith's hands I made a mental note to always watch out when small blues are in both towers, but I didn't imagine playing an opening like that. It looks like it could work pretty well. We'll see.
antihero: towers = homeworlds. I just lost horribly at alien city, so it's on my mind.

antihero: I realize this is a competitive game and all, but did I have a better follow up move than b y3 evergreen?
TwoShort: Not necessarily; When you first put the y1 in my homeworld, I figured the whole point was to give yourself room to grow the y3 and throw a wrench in my plans to grab the b3s; both of which you've now done. What I was worried you might do last turn is sacrifice your b3 to turn both of the ys in my homeworld to green and cause a catastrophe, taking my 3 point and one of my stars. The result of that might have been to your advantage, but any game with the 3 pointers gone is going to be pretty volatile. In any case, getting a Y3 is hard to argue with.

24) TwoShort: Trade Y2 R2 Twoshort
antihero: <-- flying by the seat of his pants!
TwoShort: Hmm... That one I don't think was such a good idea.

antihero: yeah, I'm making backwards progress here.. woo!
antihero: whoops. Sorry. I wish I hadn't done that.
