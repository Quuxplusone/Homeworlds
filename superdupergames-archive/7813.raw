	zoltar: One thing I like about this game is that when I get to positions like this, where I think you have the advantage and I felt stuck, there are creative things one can do to break the symmetry, such as this sack and creating yellows.  Now instead of my being clearly behind and your getting the last G3 ship without a fight, this mixes things up, and there's another green in the stack, so I can both delay anyone getting the G3 for another move, as well as threaten to get ahead in yellow ships.
	MikeYarrum: Oh, I didn't think of things like that. But I have an idea about how I might counter it...
