	Felix: Is the "Goldilocks" homeworld setup considered strongest? I have seen most of the top-rated players on here using it almost exclusively.
	wil: It appeara to go banker, goldilocks, fortress...but I like trying fortress... If you are a starship commander, you should allow the lessor player to play banker...which leaves us playing goldilocks and fortress more often...it is decorum.... But once you win a few games...gloves are off!

24) Felix: Build Y2 Newhope
	Felix: Oh, I see. Makes sense! And that's assuming I'll ever win a game :) Perhaps I shall try the banker next time and see if I can get a leg up.

25) wil: M R3 Wil Newhope
	wil: You understand the investment strategy right?  It is what helps.
	Felix: I think I get the principle. Parking g1 ships at large stars and then cashing them in later?

26) Felix: Sacrifice G2 Lasthope
Build Y3 Lasthope
Build Y3 Lasthope
	wil: Exactly...
	wil: I need to fill up my ship with fuel...it will soon be used for a long distance mission.

27) wil: A Y2 Newhope
	Felix: I'll just make some more fuel for you, then. You're welcome to take what you need.

28) Felix: Move Y3 Lasthope Y2
	wil: That was kind of you...especially since it appears fossil fuels are at a premium...thankfully I think that is all that is required
	wil: You have some options... But it is one move to mate as it stands

	Felix: Ah yes, I know it well. And I counter with the ol' desperate last-ditch fuel explosion technique.
	wil: Yes....we were so reliant on fossil fuels we had to leave our homeworld...we saw you had similar issues, reliant on fuel and violence in your stars...we've brought the power and ability to change that....Felix's dark side is no longer..
	Felix: I learned much. Thanks, and I look forward to a rematch!
