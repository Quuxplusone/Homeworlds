Variants: "Hard time"
Started: 2014.12.9, Ended: 2014.12.14
Participants: TeeTeeTee (S), dlwillson (N)
Winner: TeeTeeTee

1) dlwillson: H B3 Y1 G3
	TeeTeeTee: Hello! That was a quick challenge.
	dlwillson: I was waiting for you to finish your game with Wil, and worrying that someone would challenge me before you did. :-)

2) TeeTeeTee: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3

3) dlwillson: B G1 Dlwillson
	TeeTeeTee: Indeed - I have been challenged a lot, here.

4) TeeTeeTee: Build G1 Teeteetee
	dlwillson: Did you have to beat TwoShort? He's a great player. Have you played Zoltar? I was away for about a year and a half.

5) dlwillson: T G1 B1 Dlwillson

6) TeeTeeTee: Trade G1 Y1 Teeteetee

7) dlwillson: B B1 Dlwillson
	TeeTeeTee: I've never played Zoltar, which is a shame - I've heard good things about him. I've played TwoShort only once, but I had a very strong start in that game and didn't really give him a chance to get started. I've also heard that SilentTitan is a strong player, but I haven't played a full game with them yet. I reckon that the strongest people that I've played full games with so far are Broccoli_Commander and Wil.

8) TeeTeeTee: Build Y1 Teeteetee

9) dlwillson: D B1 Dlwillson G2 Field

10) TeeTeeTee: Discover Y1 Teeteetee B3 Dalwhinnie

15) dlwillson: T G3 Y3 Dlwillson

16) TeeTeeTee: Discover Y1 Teeteetee B3 Strathisla

17) dlwillson: T B2 R2 Dlwillson

18) TeeTeeTee: Build G1 Dalwhinnie

19) dlwillson: M Y3 Dlwillson Field

20) TeeTeeTee: Trade G1 R1 Dalwhinnie
	TeeTeeTee: Haha! I like that move.

21) dlwillson: Discover Y3 Field G3 Sea
	dlwillson: I'm glad you approve. Your "Going for the Gold", what I secretly call "TwoShort's Gambit" caught me by surprise, but I think you pulled it a move too early, and I'm doing my best to prove it, but you're a strong player, so it's going to be difficult. I'll need a moment to consider my next move.

22) TeeTeeTee: Sacrifice Y2 Dalwhinnie
Move G3 Dalwhinnie Field
Move G3 Field Dlwillson

23) dlwillson: Sacrifice Y3 Sea
Discover R2 Dlwillson Y2 Golden
Move B1 Field Dlwillson
Discover B2 Field Y3 Sunny

24) TeeTeeTee: Move Y1 Strathisla Teeteetee

25) dlwillson: T B1 G1 Dlwillson
	TeeTeeTee: I reckon that, if you'd played "S b2 field, t r2 g2 dlwillson, t b1 r1(or g1) field" instead of sacrificing the y3, then you could have forced a draw (I assume that if someone sacrifices their last ship at their homeworld to capture the other one, then it's a draw?)

26) TeeTeeTee: Trade Y2 R2 Teeteetee
	dlwillson: I think the game won't allow that, but I'm not sure.

27) dlwillson: B G1 Dlwillson

28) TeeTeeTee: Sacrifice R1 Dalwhinnie
Attack B1 Dlwillson

29) dlwillson: Build G1 Dlwillson

30) TeeTeeTee: Pass
Catastrophe Dlwillson Green
	dlwillson: Confirmed. A player may not eliminate himself/herself.
	TeeTeeTee: Aha. I see now that it's explicitly stated in the rules file that a player can't eliminate themselves. That would have been a shock...
 
Thanks for the game! Let me know if you have any comments or insights on the game (or if you wanted to hear mine.)
