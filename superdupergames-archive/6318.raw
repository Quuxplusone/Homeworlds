	jbj77: Is this my long lost Texan brother Larry?

2) jbj77: Homeworld Y1 B2 G3
	larry: Yep, Larry from Texas.  Hey, I don't remember any strategies, and despite our three day playing period, I don't spend a lot of time thinking about it.  So, tell me if I've done something obviously retarded.
	jbj77: OK.  I just realized I've gotten myself into 5 simultaneous games, so I won't have much time to think either.

8) jbj77: Build G1 Jbj77
	larry: All right, looks like I was late again, but I did try to get on yesterday and the website wouldn't let me.

9) larry: Trade R3 G3 Larry
	jbj77: That's OK.  I'm stuck in Baltimore right now.
	larry: I didn't know you were going to Baltimore, are you doing the polygraph for NSA or something?  Did you get snowed in?

10) jbj77: Build G1 Jbj77
	larry: By the way, I don't get how the timing works.  I guess that's why I always run out of time.
	jbj77: Yah, I got snowed in.

11) larry: Discover G3 Larry Y2 Clubron

12) jbj77: Trade G3 Y3 Jbj77
