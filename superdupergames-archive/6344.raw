	morganfitzp: My only problems with Memphis have involved humorless administrators, flaky anarchists, and inebriated punks listening to country music.

	dsheldon: This is getting pretty intense.
	morganfitzp: Yes. Intense like a super nova.
	dsheldon: I knew I was losing one star.  I failed to recognize I was going to lose both.  I might have been able to hold you off for another turn or two, but my defeat was assured a good while ago.
 
My major blunder was in failing to diversify my fleet sooner (or at all really...).  Thanks for a very eye-opening defeat.
	morganfitzp: Yeah - That was an amazing game! Very interesting moves on your part. I was sure that I was getting your blue star a turn earlier. Thanks for playing!
