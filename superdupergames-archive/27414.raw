Homeworlds Online (SDG# 27414)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2015.4.9, Ended: 2015.5.6
Participants: Takvorian (S), wil (N)
Winner: wil

1) wil: Homeworld B3 Y1 G3
	Takvorian: Hello again,
thanks for setting up a teaching game! I am very interested to know what you are thinking when making moves in Homeworlds.

2) Takvorian: Homeworld R1 B2 G3
	wil: I've tried other scenarios but have always come back to green ships...I don't wanna give up a factory possibility..it just isn't worth it.  Now for you...since the bank is limited you need to insure you don't give me a monopoly opportunity immediately (no small yellow!!)
	Takvorian: So far, I had always chosen a homeworld with a red star, so I will do it again here. I remember not to choose the same color of your small star from our other game.

3) wil: Build G1 Wil

4) Takvorian: Build G1 Takvorian
	wil: red in homeworld is good..you never have to worry about protection in your homeworld...I like yellow..it allows me to get out early and take to the stars...but differing openings require differing responses.

5) wil: D G1 Wil Y2 Y2
	wil: i didn't mean to back up..I was being clumsy
	wil: Begin with the end in mind...  I look at three things...how can I get rid of the other homeworld stars...how can I get rid of the ships....how can I get to Queens first.

6) Takvorian: Trade G1 R1 Takvorian
	Takvorian: So the first move is always easy ;)
It seems to me that as in many strategy games there is a bit of a first player advantage, right?
And the only possibility to get rid of homeworld stars is to trigger a catastrophe, or?
	wil: Yes and yes

7) wil: B G1 Y2
	wil: The advantage of yellow in my homeworld... Being able to get right out

8) Takvorian: Build R1 Takvorian
	Takvorian: I don't know, was my move o.k.?
	Takvorian: Or should I go for yellow?
	wil: either are good choices...  there are only two smalls. yellow however only has two yellows..possibly a faster way to get to queens and lets you get outta your homeworld...you already have a red so you are limited on how many of those you can grow before you have to get a yellow to move out...  
	wil: red should force me to get a red soon...yellow doesn't...but yellow looks to me to be the better path...although both will force me off greens soon.
	Takvorian: ok, so because my red isn't a big blunder, I'll keep it and see what will happen...

	wil: You tell me if you wanna back up and play differently or want to leave it alone and tell me if you want to play it out and see how it works out.

9) wil: Build G1 Wil
	Takvorian: As I see it, my options are very limited at this point. I will grab the last small red...

10) Takvorian: Build G2 Takvorian
	wil: That is right...at this point...as I said,I wold have headed for yellow...so you could get out and about...but this isn't bad..I have to build a green, lets you get into drones, you usually don't want the last small of anything, lets somebody else get into mediums...unless you control the market...which you currently do...

11) wil: Discover G1 Y2 B3 B3
	Takvorian: My Homeworld looks a bit crowded with reds at the moment but as you do not have a red yet I think it is not too dangerous...
I will build a g2 now and perhaps trade it later on into a y2

12) Takvorian: Trade G2 Y2 Takvorian

13) wil: Build G2 B3
	wil: Exactly and I made a mistake my not doing the move I just made last time....that way I would have got the g2 when you built a g1

14) Takvorian: Build Y1 Takvorian
	Takvorian: Is this trade reasonable now?

15) wil: Trade G2 Y2 B3

16) Takvorian: Discover R1 Takvorian B3 Tb3
	Takvorian: Now the point has come, where I really have no idea how to proceed...

17) wil: Build G2 Wil
	wil: There are two major stall points in the game...when you run out of smalls or mediums and taking the last one will allow the other guy to jump up a notch on ya and get more powerful ships... (one goal...get to 3s first) the other is when we've completely exhausted the bank...there is nothing else left to take...now what do I do...  In both cases it must always be, begin with the end in mind...you need to put 3 blues and 3 yellows within shooting distance of my homeworld to create a doomsday machine and end the game (and have a way to get them in)  Or you need to get enough 3s within shooting distance and enough big red guns to out power me in my homeworld...the entire game is about amassing enough ships in the right positions to be able to accomplish an end game condition.

	wil: Along the way, you try to take over stars that the other has built, take over ships the other has created, and catastrophe at times to reboot the galaxy...  It is a game of chess, of positioning and control of the galaxy...in a balanced way so as the other guy cannot do the same to you.

	wil: I am looking at, I build another g2, trade for r2, have the y2 to send it in if you don't clear out your reds (forces you to move some out)...  I took the Y2 so if you took a Y1 I would be able to get a Y3...if you move Ys out so you can get two to my one...I'll create an investment and leave a y2 back in the bank just to cause trouble maybe...If I were you I'd be moving out and creating more stars, more bases of operation in the galaxy to prepare to launch attacks..
	Takvorian: Your thoughts are very helpful for me, although they are still at a much higher level than mine...;)
I see that my homeworld is a bit crowded with reds, so I will move one out, but even then I don't know if it is better to build a yellow or blue system. I opt for blue. What do you think?

18) Takvorian: Move Y2 Takvorian B3

19) wil: Discover Y2 B3 G2 G2
	wil: a.  we may get another commentator!  TeeTeeTee one of the best on the board (if not the best) has asked to pipe in...his thoughts and analysis are always top notch.  But tell me why you should n't build a yellow...
	TeeTeeTee: Hi Takvorian,
 
I had written some comments, but you've both already moved in the time it took me to write them! Serves me right for trying to say too much, I guess...
 
I would probably have done something different on the last turn... I think that your greatest advantage at this point in the game is that you have red ships and Wil does not. At present, if you started moving ships into Wil's worlds, then he has to run, or lose the ships. (Remember that you can attack a ship by sacrificing a red ship in a different system, and that the attacking ship doesn't need to be red: it only needs to be the same size or larger than the attacked ship.)
 
(On the question of blue or yellow world: I'd have opted for discovering a green world. In the early game, the primary aim is to get a large ship before your opponent, or to prevent your opponent from getting one. Wil's route to large ships is through building greens, and staking out a g3 star stops him from going a large ship ahead.)
 
Hope this helps!

20) Takvorian: Build R2 Takvorian
	Takvorian: Sorry for my late answer wasn't online very often during the last days.

	Takvorian: Hi TeeTeeTee,
 
Thanks for taking the time to comment on our game. Very helpful ideas! There is so much to discover in this game...
	wil: no worries..  So nice move, I like the agressiveness... you've got a red, I haven't any, nice move to head in and attack... do I mitigate it by moving on?  or by growing yellows?  

21) wil: Sacrifice G3 Wil
Build G2 Y2
Build G3 B3
Build G3 Wil

22) Takvorian: Build Y1 Takvorian
	Takvorian: is building another red reasonable?

	wil: Its not terrible...but at every move there is a theoretical 'best move' your concern is the inability to factory...mine is I have no red...so while I can factory, I can also be in great trouble... I think my thing is to factory and get another big 3...since I have a y2 I'll be able to keep you at bay from getting a factory... I'll wait a day...
	wil: note:  not that I ever know what the theoretical best move is...  the game takes such wonderful twists and turns..
	Takvorian: I simply have no other ides what to do...


23) wil: Build Y3 G2
	wil: moving a r1 to a new G3 star would have kept me from getting the new 3....but I've still plenty of work to do...  trading out my 3 is not easy as you can grow it...(although I could trade it for  Y3...and that would keep you at bay)

24) Takvorian: Move Y1 Takvorian Tb3
	wil: b y3 g2

25) wil: Trade G3 R3 B3

	Takvorian: Wil, thanks for the patience you had with me, but I will resign now. Seems that Homeworlds is not really my cup of tea...
	wil: Oh well...  take care...  hope to see you around.
