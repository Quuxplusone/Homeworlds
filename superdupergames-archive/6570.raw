	zoltar: The nycavri homeworld has fallen to the great Zoltarian fleet!
	nycavri: Yup - that's game.  I think I'm done with Homeworlds on SDG for a little while.  0 for 6 is a little depressing.  Thanks for schooling me again, though.  *grin*

	zoltar: Hey, try playing someone else at it, as I'm one of the three best players -- you now have the experience to have an even game against many of the other players.  Also, try a 4 player homeworlds game, as there is less pressure, and you can lay low and build your fleet while the others attack each other sometimes.
