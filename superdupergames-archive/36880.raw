	Layana: Wow, that was a quick one. I'll need to check where it fell apart :) 
	eliscinsky: Small universes can go fast if you're not very careful. I should have said something before I moved.  I sometimes forget what levels my opponents are when I'm playing more than 2 games simultaneously. :(  I also saw that you had moved 3 hours earlier, and figured you had time to double check your move. (no undo)
 
Mainly I think you let me get to much of one economy (green), which allowed me to position myself one strike away, and catastrophe your large.
 
Do you know about the SDG archive?  SDG has a mode to show step by step how a game progresses. You can use it anytime on any game, even if the game is not over. For this game the link is ...
 
http://www.superdupergames.org/?page=archive_play&gid=36880
 
To use it on another game just replace the gid (Game ID) number with the game number you're interested in. Any game number, not just HW games. 
 
One last thing, I see you're playing Babamots and he's been teaching you so I guess you already know about his HW guides at ... https://jpeterbaker.github.io/homeworlds/site/index.html (no hyphens)
 
Hope to see you again for a rematch (anytime).
