	wil: tis a cat and mouse game...I was one step ahead on growth, if you didn't trade for a red I could see a way to control the economy...worse than that...it is the red economy which covers attacks...(all monopolies are bad this just has another aspect.  
 
only one move I see that can delay me winning in 3

	wil: I still miss stuff all the time...and probably lost 90% of my first 20 games....recognizing both attacks and opportunities comes from watching yourself get whooped (my opinion)
