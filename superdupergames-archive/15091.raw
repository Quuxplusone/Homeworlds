Participants: MaxL (S), TwoShort (N)
Winner: TwoShort

1) TwoShort: Homeworld R1 B3 G3
	MaxL: Hello again!
	TwoShort: Hello again.  Here's my chance to get a pointer in when it can help:  You probably want one of your stars to be a 2.  That will put your homeworld 3 hops from mine instead of 2.  the "small universe" we played last time makes for a more quickly aggressive game, but that's generally thought to be to the first players advantage.  Most people think a 1/2 homeworld ("Banker") is best, and I agree.  My habit of taking 1/3 ("Goldilocks") vs. new players is mostly to be nice, as opposed to an example to follow...

	TwoShort: Don't flip it back now, but as a general guideline, I wouldn't take red before you need to.  Until having a red means you could get to me and do real damage, or that I can't do real damage even though I could get to you, it's not doing anything for you.
