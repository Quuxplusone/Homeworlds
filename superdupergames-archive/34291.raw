	Babamots: Just so you know, I use a point system for a rough idea of the relative values of ships. I give 1 point for smalls, 3 points for mediums, and 7 for larges. Of course some colors or positions can be more valuable than others, but I often use this if I expect that lots of ships are about to be destroyed or attacked and I want to decide who comes out ahead in material.

29) DodoBirb: Discover B1 Green G1 Littlegreen

30) Babamots: Build B2 Bajor

31) DodoBirb: Build B3 Littlegreen
	Draw5PlayAll: Larges should be 9 for the first two and 6 for each thereafter. Having 2 larges is much stronger than 1 and the score should reflect that. Four versus five and so on depends more on the rest of the situation.
 
Just my opinion.

	Babamots: I should have mentioned your danger to you. I can sacrifice a yellow to catastrophe all your home ships. You should undo and try a different move.
	Babamots: Here's an SDG tip: clicking the "Call admin" button sends participants an email (I wanted to make sure you checked the game without actually using my turn).
 
I don't think Aaron has actually responded to the button in years, but it will pause the timer and notify players.

46) Babamots: Discover B1 Cardassia Y3 Iconia
	DodoBirb: Don't worry about forgetting to tell me I'm about to lose. I really should have noticed the y2 in Bajor.

47) DodoBirb: Move G2 Littlegreen Iconia
	Babamots: On the whole, it may have been healthier for your education to lose unexpectedly. I became way more careful after the first time I got blindsided by a home-emptying catastrophe.
 
On the other hand, this will give you a chance to see some more late game in action.

Attack G2 Dodobirb
Attack Y3 Dodobirb

	Babamots: If an enemy ship comes into your home system, you almost always need to attack it immediately. Otherwise, they get a chance to attack your ships, or sometimes they'll start building more ships in your home to make catastrophes.
	DodoBirb: Wow I only thought about the catastrophe and thought it was inevitable so I ignored it. oops
	Babamots: Good game! I think you understand lots of things in the game well. With practice, you'll have a better idea of things to watch out for and take advantage of.
 
If you'd like to practice faster, you could try having several games running at once. I'm happy to play you again, and you could challenge a few other people. You might like to play with MagicJohn. He's a fairly new player who moves several times a day. You can also issue a challenge to no one in particular (with a note about your skill level, if you're worried about getting a ruthless opponent).
	Babamots: Although, come to think of it, I haven't met anyone on this site that I'd describe as ruthless. I would still add a note to any open challenges just to make sure any accepters are ready for a "beginner game."
	Babamots: You're right, the blue catastrophe was inevitable. I was ready to follow it up with a red catastrophe to finish you off (notice that Bajor would become connected to your home after the blue catastrophe).
