	wil: greed won out...the same blind spot I often have...this you need to conquer
	wil: the pisser is you are going to be beating me soon!
	wil: I did present a dodge...the appearance that I was trying to take all those yellows before you could get to them...but all I really wanted was that one little blue...if I would have done that by itself it would have been more obvious my motive.
	OnePageWars: nah. Maybe eventually. But then again, maybe not. And I would have to get pretty lucky to beat you in a 'soon' time scedule.
	wil: You'll be surprised... I get a win in every now and again amongst those better...
	OnePageWars: Yeah, I might get lucky.
