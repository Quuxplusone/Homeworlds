	wil: You go camping to the same place or different parks?  Car camping, RVing, or backpackin?

17) ts52: Build G3 Ts52
	ts52: So far we always go the same place, but they've had so many problems with cyanobacteria, we may have to find some new places. Basically car camping, but the place we go you have to haul your gear away from the parking area, so you don't hear cars coming and going from your site. We have a '10 person' tent for the 4 of us. :D
