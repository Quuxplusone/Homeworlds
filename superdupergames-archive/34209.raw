Catastrophe Betazed R
	Babamots: Yeah, it's never advantageous to leave a catastrophe un-triggered (in 2-player). Although in this case, I would have just done it for you.

34) Felix: B G1 Felix
	Felix: Yeah, I just forgot to trigger it! Although before you captured my yellow I was considering moving another in and leaving the cat un triggered so you couldn't build any of the yellows yet. I figured since I controlled all the ships that it wouldn't be as risky

	Babamots: I'm probably not going to be able to sleep wondering whether you'll find a way out of this.

	Babamots: Whew, that was a pretty different game. I spent most of it feeling frightened. I think I like regular-size universe better. It's move forgiving.
 
Your gambit have me pause for sure. That wasn't a scenario I specifically mapped out.
 
Good games! The tournament had been quite a ride. I'm about ready to start a fresh one.
	Felix: Interestingly, I don't think there was any move I could make here at the end. Very interesting game for sure! A textbook example of why only destroying half the opponent's start with no immediate plan for the rest is dangerous. Congrats and well played!
	Babamots: I had never before seen a position where passing was the only option, so it was fun to arrange it.
 
You've taught me a lot this tournament. Valiantly fought, sir!
