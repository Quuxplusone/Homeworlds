	Lexicon: Aaron: If someone is late to a game of Sinister and another player forces his resignation, does his right hand player win or does the right hand player's target shift?  Not that we should hit porter235, I'm just curious about implimentation.
	Lexicon: Also what happens in Sinister if a player resigns?
	Jesse: I believe the effect of forcing resignation is equivalent to the player resigning voluntarily, and that this does not give a win for the player to the right.  It's similar to a player being eliminated by anyone other than the player to the right; the right hand player's target shifts.
	Lexicon: Ah, that makes sense.
	Aaron: That is correct.
	Lexicon: Well, porter hasn't played in 2 weeks nor logged in in 9 days.  Anyone know what happened to him?
	Aaron: No idea.  I think we should go ahead and force his resignation.  It sucks, but it has been 2 weeks.
	Lexicon: I'm for it.
	Lexicon: It's kind of rediculous.  3 of my 4 homeworlds games are in timesup.  And the other one I accidentally resigned, it seems.  Hard to get homeworlds love around here.
	Lexicon: Actually, this had me thinking that good flags on active challenges might be newbies-only and no-newbies (require a certain rating or a certain number of games at game creation time.)

23) Batman: Pass
	SYSTEM: porter235 resigns.
	Lexicon: I resigned him.  But now it thinks it's my turn.  I'll pass and then Batman should pass and then it'll be in the right state.

24) Aaron: Build G1 Aaron

25) Lexicon: Build Y1 Lexicon
	Aaron: I'm really sorry.  The forced resignation code for this particular game has given my tons of trouble.  I'm going to revisit it soon.  Is everything OK now?
	Aaron: I like the idea of a "minimum number of games played" flag.  I will tackle that.

26) Batman: Build Y2 Batman
	Lexicon: Aaron: When you update the game code are you updating it for the current games or just for all newly created games?  

27) Aaron: Discover Y1 Aaron G3 Lime
	Aaron: It depends on the change.  Most changes affect all existing games as well.  I can only think of one or two changes that only applied to newly created games.

	Lexicon: Gah, you're attacking me just so I don't annihilate Cedar aren't you Aaron.
	Lexicon: On another note, I think it'd be better if the moves referenced the player's names instead of their locations.  I can never follow it unless I'm south.  Aaron (S) would be better I think.
