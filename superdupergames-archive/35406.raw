	speardane: [ajo says:] Well, this "closed position" is certainly showing off speardane's lack of foresight. It seems to be stuck at a local maximum (until you give it a pressing concern). It would probably be doing "pass" every turn right now, except that it has a hard rule never to "pass" unless it's checkmated (on the logic that if the game is winnable at all, _some_ move must be better than "pass" by definition).

74) Draw5PlayAll: Move Y2 Water Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: Nice to know that. My current plan will seem very boring until I have 3 blues at Earth and another large at something. IICC that takes 6 turns before Delos or Minsky goes supernova.
