	Aristos: First blood!
	zoltar: Well, that wasn't very nice!

	Aristos: Yeah, I know... I'm constantly on guard against it. Just missed that one.
	Aristos: Well played. I can't see any way out of the convergence of your large ships. 
	zoltar: Yeah, it's a slow death from this point on. Still can't believe I missed that obvious 'checkmate' in two moves. I'm rusty and haven't really played in over a year, but at least I was able to swindle you in the opening to get the big ships. I was worried you'd get a lock on the yellow from the start so was aggressively trying to stop that. gg
