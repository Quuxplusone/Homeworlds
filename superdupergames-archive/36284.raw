Started: 2020.4.14, Ended: 2020.4.14
Participants: Babamots (S), thecolorbrown (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) thecolorbrown: Homeworld R1 B2 G3

2) Babamots: Homeworld R3 B1 G3
	Babamots: Howdy! I don't think I've seen you around before. Is this your first time on SDG?

3) thecolorbrown: Build G1 Thecolorbrown
	thecolorbrown: It is! I got obsessed with homeworlds and was dying for people to play with 
	thecolorbrown: so difficult to get any good at it

4) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots

5) thecolorbrown: Trade G1 Y1 Thecolorbrown
	Babamots: It's certainly hard to find people to play with in person. I'm working on a Tabletopia version right now for better real-time play online.
 
I got obsessed with HW about four years ago. How about you?

6) Babamots: Trade G1 Y1 Babamots
	thecolorbrown: that's amazing! keep me posted. i got into it these last few months. couldnt afford the actual pyramids. made some out of card stock haha
	Babamots: You can also draw your own card-based version: draw a triangle on one side for a ship and a square on the other side for a star.
 
Do you know about the HW boxed set Kickstarter? It's $20, which is way more accessible than $77 for the Pyramid Arcade.

7) thecolorbrown: Build G1 Thecolorbrown

8) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots
	thecolorbrown: no i hadnt heard of that. that might help. these cardstock pyramids won't last long

9) thecolorbrown: Trade G1 B1 Thecolorbrown

10) Babamots: Trade G1 R1 Babamots
	Babamots: It looks you can still pledge to the Kickstarter campaign, though outside of the Kickstarter interface. You could get the pyramids in the fall, a little before they're available to non-backers. The page is here (you can click "Late Pledge Option")

14) Babamots: Discover R1 Babamots R2 Romulus

15) thecolorbrown: Build B2 Greenguy

16) Babamots: Build R2 Babamots
	Babamots: I don't necessarily recommend the strategy I'm trying here. It's experimental :-D

17) thecolorbrown: Trade B2 R2 Greenguy
	thecolorbrown: you making that r2 is freaking me out tho

18) Babamots: Trade R2 Y2 Babamots

19) thecolorbrown: Build B2 Greenguy

22) Babamots: Sacrifice G3 Babamots
Build R2 Iconia
Build R3 Iconia
Build R3 Romulus

23) thecolorbrown: Build B2 Greenguy
	Babamots: Not having a large ship in your home is what I like to call "the big no-no." This is much more reckless than I usually play.
	thecolorbrown: gonna need a minute to think here hmm

24) Babamots: Sacrifice Y2 Babamots
Move R3 Romulus Babamots
Move R3 Iconia Greenguy

25) thecolorbrown: Sacrifice G3 Thecolorbrown
Build Y1 Greenguy
Build Y2 Greenguy
Build Y3 Thecolorbrown

26) Babamots: Sacrifice R2 Iconia
Attack R2 Greenguy
Attack Y2 Greenguy

27) thecolorbrown: Trade Y3 B3 Thecolorbrown
	thecolorbrown: well you've definitely got me now. My red game still really ain't good hmm
	Babamots: So you know, I'm responding much faster than is usual on SDG. One or two moves a day is typical for most people. That's part of why I want a good real-time implementation online somewhere like Tabletopia.

28) Babamots: Sacrifice R3 Greenguy
Attack B2 Greenguy
Attack Y2 Greenguy
Attack B1 Greenguy
	Babamots: Employing/defending red-powered invasions is super interesting.
	thecolorbrown: yeah for sure that's my impression 
	Babamots: Sacrificing blue to trade some of your ships for green may be a good move. If you can cause a green catastrophe in greenguy, I don't want to have any ships there.
	Babamots: The most interesting part of most games is the end. When you try to strike a killing blow, you often have to leave yourself open to a counterattack. Even if you plan perfectly, your opponent is often just one move away from destroying you when you win. Many attempts to win the game turn to disaster.

29) thecolorbrown: Sacrifice B3 Thecolorbrown
Trade B1 G1 Greenguy
Trade Y1 G1 Greenguy
Trade Y1 G1 Thecolorbrown
	thecolorbrown: yeah the blue sac is the plan but ima be majorly screwed after that

30) Babamots: Sacrifice Y2 Greenguy
Move R2 Greenguy Thecolorbrown
Move Y2 Greenguy Thecolorbrown
	Babamots: Yeah, I guess that threat is too late. I can just move in now.

31) thecolorbrown: Build G2 Greenguy
Catastrophe Greenguy Green
	thecolorbrown: yup, i make a g2 at home and then you sac r2 to take both
	Babamots: You probably haven't seen the way to switch between the "Play Page"  and the "Archive Page." The Archive page lets you see every position of the game and step through them.
 
There's a js file here that you can copy into a bookmark to switch between SDG's play and archive views.

32) Babamots: Attack G1 Thecolorbrown
	Babamots: The archive view lets you go back and see what you/the other guy could have done different.
	Babamots: You can also get to the archive view by pasting the game number into a URL with this form

	Babamots: Anyway, thanks for the game! I'm up for another one, but I'll probably play slower (I need to work on some other things).
 
Let me know if you'd like my analysis of this match or a practice game with open discussion of strategy. I enjoy helping people strengthen their game.
	thecolorbrown: I would love all of that! How does a person even start a new game?
	thecolorbrown: And I'm definitely open to any advice you've got
	Babamots: You can scroll to the game you want and click "New Challenge" on the challenge page here
 
http://superdupergames.org/main.html?page=listgames#homeworlds
 
You can pick specific people to challenge or just leave the challenge open for anyone to join you.
 
The main thing in this game was, on your 12th move, I think you should have moved r2 to Iconia and triggered the catastrophe. We would have been about equal in material and you would have had better color diversity.
	thecolorbrown: yeah i was just looking over it and did actually see that. What a shame. Oh well. I'm new
	Babamots: We all live and learn!
