	wil: By also picking goldilocks... We have a short universe is that your intent?  You may back up and change
	sompm: That was intentional. If there is a known disadvantage to matched planets for a given player, then I'll switch back, but I do want to see how a short universe pans out.

	sompm: Good game. Not kidding about matched Homeworlds being fast - I think that was the shortest game I've ever played.
	wil: Yez..n I fell asleep at the wheel
	sompm: That's sometimes literal. I once took a game of chess from slightly in my advantage to lost in six moves by playing late at night.
