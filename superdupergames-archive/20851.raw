Attack R2 Subhan64
	ajo: That doesn't get you out of check! :P  It's a rated game, so I'll take the win. Better luck next time. :)
	Subhan64: nothing would have got me out of check
	ajo: My analyzer says 304 distinct possible moves would have gotten you out of check. For example, "move g3 Blueberry Subhan64" would have done the trick, and left you in a decent position after I catastrophed yellow.
	Subhan64: Oh, so you are not playing your own games?
	Subhan64: Wouldn't have saved me anyway.  If I moved g3 back home, I still would have lost one of my homeworld stars.  This is a position that is so incredibly week that people will nearly always resign at that point rather than drag out the game.
	ajo: I do play my own games. I use my analyzer primarily to verify before announcing "Checkmate", just to avoid looking stupid by being wrong. ;)
	ajo: "[Losing half a homeworld] is so incredibly weak that people will nearly always resign at that point..." Nope, definitely not true. Especially in this case; you would have had quite the material advantage. After the catastrophe, I'd be left with r1g1g3 to your y1g2g3y3.
	Subhan64: There's a lot more to the advantage then mere piececount.  The location of the pieces is also very important, and I think it's really easy to underestimate the effect of the asymmetrical distance relationship between the two homeworlds -  there are now 2 sizes of stars which are 1 step away from the dimminished homeworld, whereas only 1 size can directly reach the opponenets.

	ajo: Sure, you were worse off after I blew up your homeworld than before; otherwise I wouldn't have done it! But the material advantage makes up quite a bit of the difference. If I were you, I wouldn't have resigned when you did.
	ajo: But then again, it does save time. ;) Resigning immediately when you make a mistake might lead to more rapid improvement in your early game, even if it does decrease your win percentage in the short run.
