Started: 2015.6.1, Ended: 2015.6.3
Participants: jrandom (S), wil (N)
Winner: wil

1) wil: Homeworld Y3 R1 G3 *
	wil: thank you for the game!!  What do you think of it so far...frustration level?

2) jrandom: Homeworld B1 G3 Y3
	jrandom: I think the worst part is when I suddenly discover that my clever move isn't allowed.  E.g. not being able to create ships with a colour that you don't already control.
	wil: this is an unconventional opening...opening without a blue in the past was considered ludicrous...I am busy proving that otherwise
	jrandom: Which means that you need to use blue to trade.  Except you can't trade unless there's a ship of the appropriate size.
	wil: yes you must have the resources to build new ships...the star can't provide...your team must have another ship, a pattern to build it..  that and 'how exactly do I attack?" are common hurdles
	wil: exactly right again...hence the reason if someone else gets that color...you better as well

3) wil: Build G1 Wil
	jrandom: Since we're both doing Goldilocks, this game will probably be quick.

23) wil: Discover G1 Wil Y2 Y2
	wil: which move was wrong?  the second was much better than the first..
	jrandom: I know, but it wasn't the second move I wanted.  Oh, well.

24) jrandom: Move R2 Jrandom Y2
	jrandom: You now have an opportunity to beat our swords into ploughshares.

25) wil: Discover G1 Y2 Y3 Y3
	wil: yeah there is that..but starting over isn't in the current plan
	wil: one of my thoughts is always begin with the end in mind....two ways to win the game...take over all the pieces in the homeworld or destroy both homeworld stars... every move should be thinking about building a flotilla that is preparing one or both scenarios whilst wheedling the others chances of doing the same..  
	wil: short universes are generally frowned upon as games...but interesting thing about them is that killing half a homeworld provides no advantage

	jrandom: In fact, your next move will probably be to sacrifice y3 in g3, then move b2 from b2 to jrandom, then b1 from wil to b2, then b2 to jrandom, then catastrophe blue.
	wil: exactly...and that is why the b1 moved in...didn't matter if you attacked her...she is still blue..  I was forever without a big three in this match...you should have got and sacked a y2 attacked me directly with your Queen and used my own red star to anihilate me...but you are starting to see things
	wil: the more you play the more you see...games are all so unique...  ya try one gambit, get foiled, move onto another...  whattya think?  gonna get started up the ladder?
