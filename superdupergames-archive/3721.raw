25) TwoShort: Move Y3 Borbor Zoltar
	zoltar: Uh-oh, it looks like checkmate if you sac your y3 in your homeworld to move the other 3 yellow ships into my homeworld.  At least I saw this one coming, even though there is no defence...

Catastrophe Zoltar Y
	zoltar: I don't get it -- was I wrong?  Wouldn't have sacrifing your Y3 in your homeworld to move the y1 from Gonzo and the y1 and y3 from BorBor all to Zoltar have blown up my star?  Well if you won't -- I will!
	TwoShort: the y1 at Gonzo would have had to move to a 3 first, and from there to your homeworld, using up 2 moves.  Next turn I could do that, and the y1 from BorBor.  It was still checkmate, it just needed 2 turns to make the 4 moves required.
	zoltar: I -still- don't get it!  Gonzo was a G1 star, and my remaining home star was a Y2 star, so why couldn't the y1 at Gonzo move directly into my homeworld in one step? 
	TwoShort: Because I'm an idiot :)  You're absolutely right.  I had been planning how to move in the yellows before I got the chance to blow up the blue first, and never adjusted my thinking.
