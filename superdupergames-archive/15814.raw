	Moves: I love how you can name the planets yourself.
	TwoShort: Welcome to SDG.  I generally try to give new players a few pointers, but I'm having a hectic week, so you might not get as many as ususal...  Anyway, the standard early-game advice: the goal early on is generally to out-grow your opponent; particularly, to get more 3 point ships than the other guy.

7) Moves: Build G1 Moves
	Moves: Thanks TwoShort. I have read all the written up material about the tactics of the game I could find. Some by you! I'm actually happy that I go before you, since I have to learn and not just copy your move.

	Moves: Oh wow! What a move.
	Moves: ah, I also did not know you could split it up into different locations. Nice.

	Moves: Ok, now I know how a Green sacrifice works. So, how does a Red sacrifice work?
	TwoShort: So for any sacrifice, the piece you sac goes back in the stash, then you get the chance to perform the action associated with that color as many times as the size of the peice, and you can use those actions with any of your ships.  For a red sacrifice, you would first need a red peice, and you would need a different piece (any color) that was in the same system as one of my pieces.  Red sacrifices are somewhat unusual, except as the final coup de grace.  The threat of a red sac often makes the opponent do something less-than-optimal to block, but by the time they can't prevent it, the game is effectively won.
  The most common sacrifice is the tactic I just employed: sacrificing a g3 for three grows when you are able to use one of them to re-grow the same g3.  We call  this "the factory".  It's definitely a key stratagem since it lets you grow twice as fast as otherwise, and anywhere you have ships.  If your opponent gets a factory going and you don't, you're probably in trouble.
  In your current position, you've got a g3, so you're not entirely locked out, but you don't have the extra green at home to let you regrow there.  You could get either of your smaller greens back home by sacrificing it, and using the action to regrow it at home.  
   Generally, you don't want to move ships out to stars that are the same color; it means you have less options.  Unless you sac something somewhere elsewhere, all you can do at Kessel is leave, and you can't currently do anything at Kuat.  Even if there were greens available, if you grew one there, I could move one of mine in and cause a catastrophe.

Catastrophe Kessel Yellow
	Moves: If the G sac was the most common, I wish the rules writer would have used that as the example instead of the yellow sac. :)
	TwoShort: Yellow sacs are also very important.  Most attacks will involve moving multiple pieces into an enemy system at once and/or moving one pieice multiple steps.  (An "attack" meaning generically either moving in more pieces than they can take with red while you have a sac-able red elsewhere, or moving in enough pieces to cause a catastrophe.)  So late in the game, Y3s are generally the most valuable pieces; and I'd really like to set up to take them now that they are available.
  But, for the super-topical example, if it were your turn now you could sac your y2 to move either your y1 or your g1 to a 3 star and then to my homeworld, and cause a catastrophe of the relevant color.  I lose more than you in either of those, so instead I'm going to take even losses by sac'ing my own y2....
 


19) Moves: Trade G2 Y2 Moves
	TwoShort: Where I said "3 star", I should have said "2 point star"
	Moves: heh, I forgot the star counted for catastrophe as well...

20) TwoShort: Discover G1 Twoshort G2 Grendel
	TwoShort: So I mentioned before that you generally don't want move ships to stars of the same color.  The reason you would want to do it sometimes is if your whole purpose is to pull the star piece out of the stash.
