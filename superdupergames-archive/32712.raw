	Draw5PlayAll: Why is blue so ignored in high level play? Is it too easy to focus on red and yellow, or are too many stars blue?
	wil: Blue is rarely ignored by me...I utilize it.whenever I can...but...the early game can define mid game...are we racing, building, blocking...this game became a race...only two colors participate in races...until one sees an advantage (or desperation) opportunity to switch
	wil: Oh, you said high level...nevermind
	Draw5PlayAll: Consider: out of the 15 ships on the board, only one (7%) is blue. Yet of the 6 stars on the field, three are blue.
 
Actually, before the previous move there were even more yellows and reds... NO BLUES!
	Draw5PlayAll: And I  think this is high level play because you two are first and second on the ladder, even though this is not a ladder game.

37) wil: B Y3 G3
	wil: We are only one and two because the best are either resting on their laurels or otherwise not in the game.

	Felix: Nice! Just came back from a long weekend and I am not playing carefully enough.
	wil: Thank you for that!   Hope you ha fun!
	wil: But what was that?  You should have sacked the y3 and moved everything in...so it would look like you almost had it!
	Felix: I always have fun :) And I was just having fun by passing 3 moves. If I can't win, I don't care about the end board appearances!
