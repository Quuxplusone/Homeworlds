Homeworlds Online (SDG# 16768)
Variants: "Hard time"
Started: 2010.6.30, Ended: 2010.7.1
Participants: goulo (S), AdamBadura (N)
Winner: AdamBadura

1) AdamBadura: Homeworld B2 G1 R3

2) goulo: Homeworld G2 B3 Y3

3) AdamBadura: Build R1 Adambadura
	goulo: I already challenged some other guy in the ladder, but he's not responded yet, so I finally accepted your challenge. I guess if he responds/accepts then I'll be in 2 ladder games at the same time or something. I didn't realize you can challenge me when I have a challenge pending with someone else. The mysteries of the ladder!

4) goulo: Build Y1 Goulo
	AdamBadura: No. I cannot. But it seems challenge is automatically rejected after some time (24-48 hours) which is good IMHO.
	AdamBadura: Anyway it was obvious that sooner or later we will fight with each other as we are here all the time... ;)

5) AdamBadura: Trade R1 Y1 Adambadura
	goulo: Strange, it says "Challenges remain open for 7 days before being counted as being declined." and he didn't explicitly decline. Maybe while the challenge was pending, you could also challenge me, and then when I get into one Ladder game it nullifies any other pending challenges with me.
	goulo: But we shouldn't KEEP challenging each other, or we'll not both climb up the ladder! We'll only climb onto the other and push the other down. :)

6) goulo: Trade Y1 R1 Goulo
	AdamBadura: I had it already twice that I challenged someone and there after 24-48 hours I can again challenge someone without any message or anything.
 
Yes. But this time challenging you was a good move for me as you were much higher and I think I am able to defeat you... ;)
	goulo: We shall see! :)

7) AdamBadura: Build Y1 Adambadura
	goulo: speaking of ladders, have a look at Mirador. It's not a pyramid game, but still a cool abstract game, and its ladder is inactive from having only 5 players, not the necessary 6 to activate it. :)
	goulo: Heh, I just joined the Blam! ladder too.
I requested a Branches ladder in the forum, but Aaron has not replied. :/
	AdamBadura: By the way. Yesterday I played Chicago Express with Arturion through Vassal (actually it was Wabash Cannonball but it is the same game). It was a two player game.
 
We interrupted it after 2nd round as I had large both money and dividend advantage and there was no point in continuing.
 
He overpaid initial auctions. Thanks to this after first round I had 3 shares while he had only 2 and I had more money. Also I bought yellow and green which have larger initial income. While he chose red and blue which are typically considered better as they have less shares to share the income.
 
2 player game of CE is very non-forgiving. In multiplayer game you can count on others mistakes or king making effect. But in two player mode once you make a mistake it is your end (unless your opponent makes something stupid too). It is just a math game in this mode. But still want to test it more.

8) goulo: Build R1 Goulo
	goulo: It just seems less interesting 2-player due to completely losing the "temporary alliance" aspect (that you might own 1 share and I own 2 shares of a company, so the company helps me more than you, but we both still want it to succeed since it helps us against the other players). I guess I'd try it again 2-player sometime, but it seems to lose a lot of the core of the game.

	AdamBadura: Saddly no. Today I cannot.

28) goulo: Build R2 Smeraldeto
	goulo: I'm not sure if it was worth it or not. We lost similar amounts of ship points/pips, but you lost more ships, so I supposed it was worth it. Time will tell. :)

Catastrophe Goulo R

	AdamBadura: Suddenyl it is all so small... ;)
	goulo: Interesting bug. It's supposed to be illegal to make a move that destroys your own homeworld. :)
	AdamBadura: :)
	AdamBadura: I think the first catastrophe you made was bad for you. I lost more but my position became better. Or at least I felt so.
	goulo: With the benefit of hindsight, I must agree! :)
	goulo: I think I've been analyzing too much in terms of material advantage (who has more ships, whose ships are worth more pips) and not enough in terms of position.
