	Aristos: Your first mistake was challenging the dread power of the Aristos Empire! Mwuhahahahahaha!
	Aristos: [Later, in Aristos Command Center]
"Um, sir..."
"Yes?"
"There's a problem with the omnipotent strategy module."
"Problem?"
"Yes, sir. Someone spilled coffee on it. It's busted."
"But... but I already broadcast my maniacal laugh across the galaxy! I assumed the module would be working. Get it fixed!" 
"Right away, sir. I just thought you should know."
"If you can't get it fixed, I need you to research technology for recalling radio transmissions..." 

6) Aristos: Trade Y1 R1 Aristos
	wil: Omnipotent strategy module??  You are still using those?  We've sent a telescope many multiples of the speed of light to the next galaxy looking back and are watching the history of our galaxy and we can't get back far enough to see when we used those ancient contraptions.

7) wil: Build Y1 Wil
	Aristos: "Get in here, private!"
"Yes, sir?"
"How in hell did the wil ambassador hear our discussion about the omniscient strategy module?"
"Well, sir, the last output of the omniscient strategy module before the coffee was spilled on it was a directive to enable permanent galactic broadcast mode on all command ships."
"What kind of ridiculous plan is that?"
"An omniscient strategy means making sure that everyone knows everything."
"WHAT?! We'll never win like that!"
"Oh. Then we should have been using the victory strategy modules all along. I believe that's what the wil are using." 
"Right. Effective immediately, we will begin using the victory strategy modules. AND TURN OFF THE BROADCAST."
"Yes, sir."

8) Aristos: Build R1 Aristos
	wil: We've got word now that they are confusing their omniscient strategy with their omnimpotent stategy module...  it is better than we thought.  

9) wil: Discover Y1 Wil G3 G3
	Aristos: It could hardly be omnipotent if it wasn't also omniscient.

	wil: Sorry, that ship was contaminated with yellow fever, while we 'know' it entered our airspace for medical assistance it was to far gone and infected two of our ships as well, they all had to be quarantined back in the bank.

45) wil: Build G1 Wil

46) Aristos: Move Y2 First B3

47) wil: Discover G1 Wil Y3 Y3
	Aristos: You are one move ahead of me on every branch. I think I paid too much to get ahead of you on size 3 ships.

48) Aristos: Sacrifice R1 Aristos
Attack Y2 B3

49) wil: Build Y2 G3
	wil: What do you mean, ahead on every branch?  I feel like I haven't yet come close to learning this game.

	Aristos: I feel like I'm short one move -- if I build, I open you up to a much more successful build unless I can build twice. If I move to attack, I end up short enough ships to defend afterward. It's like I'm one move out of sync with every strategy that I can come up with. I lost tempo when I attacked... I still think it was a good move because the extra size 3 ship puts me ahead, but I can't figure anything to *do* with it. It's like I'm just in a holding pattern, unable to advance now. 

50) Aristos: Build R1 Aristos
	wil: Have no fear...I will make some mistake which you can capitalize.

Attack B1 G3
	wil: I've flumoxed this up

61) wil: Trade Y1 R1 Wil
	Aristos: Believe it or not, I don't think you made a mistake until you just now triggered the catastrophe in red. You made an excellent play and caught up on the number of size-3 ships. I piled into your g3 system. I *think* your better move, rather than catastrophe me, was to keep advancing your blue ships toward my homeworld. If I took the time to actually capture some of your ships, I think you would have beaten me home. By triggering the catastrophe, you actually lost more ground than I did -- yes, I lost a size-3 ship, but you lost a size-2 and a size-1 AND you lost a turn. I don't have any pressure on me now, so I was free to use my other red ship to come right back into the system. 
 
You've fought very well, and I certainly wouldn't call the game at this point. I may have a small advantage now, but it isn't enough to declare victory by any means! Game on!

62) Aristos: Build R2 G3
	wil: I considered that, but I figured you'd sack your r3 and take them all in one fell swoop and then I'd be right where I am now, except you could grow another R3 and I couldn't.

63) wil: Build G1 Wil
	Aristos: Perhaps. I didnt think it was worth the expense, but I guess you couldn't know what was in my head. :-)
	Aristos: Wow. That was almost a disaster.

64) Aristos: Sacrifice Y2 B3

65) wil: Trade G1 R1 Wil

66) Aristos: Move R3 G3 G1
	Aristos: Listening to a new piece of music I found online... to the tune of "Carry On, My Wayward Son":
"Those carry ons must weigh a ton... each passenger's allowed just one... so give my weary arms some rest... don't'cha fly no more!"
