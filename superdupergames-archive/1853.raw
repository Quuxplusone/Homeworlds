Started: 2005.12.15, Ended: 2005.12.19
Participants: ts52 (S), xoet (N)
Winner: ts52

1) xoet: Homeworld G3 G3 Y3 *
	xoet: Hi ts52 no idea what I'm doing am i good or evil???
	xoet: are there more players coming? I have a friend or two that might play?

2) ts52: Homeworld B3 G2 Y3
	xoet: i think this game is evil cause ive looked over rules and wiki and the hints it took me what 48:08 min to get it right   yeah I'm the one putting homeworld g3,g3,y3 *) and wondering for almost an hour
	xoet: these rules need a revamp as far as what to type  now how do i put a lable on my system  like "North"
	ts52: Your homeworld always has the label of your userid. I set this up as a two player game, because I like it better than the multi player, but you can start more challenges for your friends to pick up.


3) xoet: Build Y1 Xoet
	xoet: I should have stayed logged on a little longer to make my second move this morning  but logged off before you moved  btw I hope you don't mind waiting twelve hours between the times I am logged I log on for about 10 hours give or take every day and a half or so

4) ts52: Build Y1 Ts52
	xoet: what am i doing?  I mean Just entering commands till something does not give me an error  what does you have no actions left mean???
	ts52: No problem. I'm not in a rush for these games.
You only get one action per turn. Your only option on your last turn was to constuct a new small yellow ship.

5) xoet: Discover Y3 Xoet B2 Ur7i
	xoet: ok that must be why i did not do anything else but now what I'm lost again   yet i have not tried any of the commands yet

14) ts52: Build Y2 Ts52

15) xoet: Build Y2 Xoet
	xoet: <<<reading rules again
	xoet: sorry about the delay

16) ts52: Build Y3 Pebble
	xoet: i thought the ship your creating had to be bigger than the ship that is creating it
my mistake solved by trial and error
	ts52: Nope, the ship you build has to match the color of one of your ships in the system, and be the smallest piece of that color.

17) xoet: Discover Y3 Pebble R3 Bird
	xoet: so a how does one get a blue or red ship?

18) ts52: Build G1 Sirius
	xoet: why did this not work discover y2 xoet r3 r4    ????    said systems not connected
	xoet: i cant trade in xoet says i have no blue to trade i cant build in xoet becuase i have no green ships cept i can build a yellow ship  how do i get a blue ship or building or something   is there a command "construct b3 xoet" that i could use 
	ts52: In order to get a non-yellow ship, you have to disvoer a blue system, and then use that system to trade your yellow ship for a non-yellow ship of the same size.
Ships can only move between connected systems. Two systems are connected if they do _not_ have the same size piece in them.
So right now xoet is connected to pebble, sirius and zerg.
You can't build a yellow ship because there are no more yellow pieces left.

19) xoet: Discover Y1 Xoet B2 Bluebird

	ts52: exactly

32) ts52: Move R3 Bluebird Xoet

33) xoet: Move Y3 Bluebird Xoet
	xoet: ack you have this one it looks like i know end conditions i think i sould move a ship back home

34) ts52: Attack Y3 Xoet

35) xoet: Move Y2 Bluebird Pebble
	ts52: Yeah, there are a few adages for this game:
 always start with two different sizes in your homewold - this makes it harder for your opponent to get into your homeword.
  always start with a large ship - there is strength in size
  between your homeworld and starting ship, have blue, green and yellow. You need green to build, and yellow to move, and eventually blue to trade for red. But if you don't have those three, you'll end up wasting time getting the one you don't
  never leave your homeworld undefended. - Keep a large ship in your homeworld if at all possible.
  finally, once you opponent has a gun, you get a gun. - Once things escalate to red ships, it becomes an arms race.
If you had kept a large ship in your homeworld, and traded one of your ships on bluebird to red right after I'd traded for a red ship, then when I moved into your homeworld, you could've sacrificed the red ship to take over my red ship, and still been alive.
We really didn't get into sacrifices in this game at all, but they are another powerful tactic in the game that it's important not to overlook.
	ts52: Ugh, I didn't realize that all my returns would get deleted, sorry that last message is so hard to read now...
	xoet: i think it was easyer for me to  read anyway  if its ok   im going to share that with my friend i got to play me   it is her first game   and my third with her

36) ts52: Attack Y1 Xoet
	ts52: No problem. Feel free to share it. Thanks for the game. I look forward to playing you again.
