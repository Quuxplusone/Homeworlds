	pgadey: The opening in this game always feels a little clunky to me. I feel like there is a long build up before anything ``begins''. I guess that just says how little I understand what's going on.

9) pgadey: Build B1 Pgadey
	wil: No you are correct....it is like chess, pushing pawns, getting out knights and bishops...the first five moves go fairly quickly, until someone does something unique....and then the game slows pace...
	pgadey: Right -- What other games are you interested in, by the way?

10) wil: Discover G1 Wil Y3 Y3
	wil: This is the only one I play here...I have thought of learning martian chess...but i play live chess, gin, hold-em, craps, euchre, all variety cards, wide variety of board games, grew up in a gaming family, and play regular with a good size group.

	pgadey: Good times! I play a number of abstracts. I go through phases of playing things online with regularity. Here I play Entropy, Amazons, Homeworlds. I wish I could play more Entropy and Homeworlds face to face. They're really great.
	wil: where abouts do you live...no homeworlds players to develop??

	pgadey: I'm in Toronto. A lovely city, with a couple board game cafés but they are all about the Euro Games. My girlfriend has got a knack for abstracts, but we're heavily into playing Nick Bentley's Catchup: http://nickbentleygames.wordpress.com/2012/04/29/my-best-game-i-suspect-ketchup/
 
So we haven't been playing much else lately.
