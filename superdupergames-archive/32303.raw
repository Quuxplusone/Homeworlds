Winner: Draw5PlayAll

1) dlwillson: Homeworld B3 Y1 G3
	Draw5PlayAll: You really asked for a 1/1/3 time control?

2) Draw5PlayAll: Homeworld B2 R1 G3
	dlwillson: Yes. I strongly prefer fast games. I figure a day is plenty of time, typically, and three days is plenty of time to get in a good think, if the other guy has submitted a particularly clever and/or surprising turn.

3) dlwillson: Build G1 Dlwillson

4) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: Yeah, just that some people cannot get on SDG every single day. I have noticed that the clock here is less of a measure of thinking time and more a measure of patience. With just one hour you could have a decent think but most of the hours are spent doing other things,
	dlwillson: Are you saying that you think the timing is too fast?

Move Y1 Draw5playall G2
	Draw5PlayAll: At this point my win is likely guaranteed. Tell me if you have any way to resist:
First I discover one of the B2s and put three yellows (from B3, G1, or my homeworld) there. Then I put three blues on G2. At this point I have a doomsday machine and you cannot block it.
The only catch is that if you obtain a blue, I may need to sac a Y2 to create another system for the blues, but I think you otherwise cannot resist.

83) dlwillson: B R1 Dlwillson
	Draw5PlayAll: I just realized I can accelerate the process this way.

	Draw5PlayAll: Good game. I wish it had been a ladder game.
	dlwillson: You'd be #1 now, if it had! :-)
	Draw5PlayAll: That is what I meant. At least I have some self efficacy in that, assuming nothing major changes, I know I have beaten the #1 seat at least once. (I have also beat Felix but not on the ladder.)
