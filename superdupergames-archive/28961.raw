Participants: wil (S), Ottia (N)
Winner: Ottia

1) Ottia: Homeworld B2 G3 R3

2) wil: H Y3 B1 G3
	Ottia: Good morning again, Wil! It's my first game, I guarantee that here I won't be playing too quickly (grin), should I make any mistakes please let me know, I'll apologise and correct immediately
	wil: Do I know you?  

3) Ottia: Build R1 Ottia
	wil: First battle you have is G in your homeworld star...keeps you from a factory at home...not insurmountable... But troublesome
	Ottia: If half a game of Blam! is knowing each other then we do, Sir. My pleasure. Now let's see what to do next (thanks for the advice, by the way!).

4) wil: B G1 Wil
	wil: Ah...okee... And no problem...I've played that...

5) Ottia: Trade R1 Y1 Ottia

6) wil: T G1 B1 Wil
	Ottia: Goodness, you make it sound difficult HAHAHAHA... I'll add some egg yolk to my system.

7) Ottia: Discover Y1 Ottia G1 Ashikawa

8) wil: B B1 Wil

9) Ottia: Build R1 Ottia
	wil: Normally I would build whatever color you built to keep up...but their were only two pawns and two drones in the blue bank...which meant to me I could get to drones and queens in blue and hopefully swap for yellow queens....so I entered the race rather than matching....your moving out yourpawn means you can't build more yellow at home right away ..  Which puts me another step closer to winning the race..
	wil: This game does have a learning curve...but is amazing... I learned it by losing doEns of games watching the attacks come after me....and then trying them against others and learning the gambits

10) wil: D B1 Wil R2 R2
	Ottia: Well, now it's your turn to inflict lots of pain HAHAHAHA... I can imagine both that the game has got a long learning curve and that it's stunning once you get past it. I will have to practice a bit to get all the chains of moves you need to make to achieve mid- or long-term goals...

11) Ottia: Trade R1 Y1 Ottia

12) wil: B B2 Wil
	Ottia: Alright, now I see resources for trading are scarce at least at the beginning ;)
	wil: Yes early phase is building and trying to corner bigger oieecda or a monopoly

13) Ottia: Build Y1 Ottia

14) wil: D B2 Wil G2 G2
	Ottia: What does oieecda mean? (if you pardon my question, I suppose you mean systems but being a novice I can never be sure...)
	wil: Pyramids..,. One helluva typo

15) Ottia: Build Y2 Ashikawa

16) wil: S G3 Wil
B B2 G2
B B3 R2

	Ottia: Goodness me... was that the autocorrector? I can't quite follow all the hand displacements to touch-type that from "Pyramids"... interesting! HAHA, patterns! By the way, do you like games like Zendo and the sort?
	wil: There  is no telling how that happened... It is just me...
