	mneme: ug.  What happened?  I'm willing to do a rematch if you're game; I hate to win this way!
	Laurie_Menke: Ugh. I'm so sorry, mneme! I've been on the road and got behind.  :(  If you'd like (and if babamots is willing), we could run another game and do it the same way to this point and just keep going. On the other hand, we both know you were going to win.  ;)  Your choice. Please forgive my boo-boo!
	Babamots: I think a rematch should be OK. If either of you wants to replay this game exactly like it was up to this point, I think you've got the right to request that. Otherwise, you can just start a totally new game. What do you prefer?
	Laurie_Menke: I'm willing to do any of the following: (1) run this exact game again, (2) start a new game, (3) concede to the clear winner. Mneme... what would make the best of this situation for you? (And thanks for the options, Babamots!)
	mneme: Lets go with just replaying it to this point and going from there.  While my freeze has some clear advantages from here, I think there's still play in it.
