Homeworlds Online (SDG# 3367)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2006.5.3, Ended: 2006.6.17
Participants: Keith (S), CDRodeffer (N)
Winner: CDRodeffer

1) CDRodeffer: Homeworld B2 Y1 G3
	CDRodeffer: OK, Keith, we're ready to go. I guess I got randomly selected to go first. When creating a home world and deciding upon your first ship, you should probably always include green somewhere (otherwise you'll be delayed in making new ships, which is very important). Whether to include yellow or blue is kind of a toss-up. Blue gives you flexibility in choosing to trade ships for new ones of the same size, but you can't go anywhere without yellow. Having red somewhere is aggressive, and it does give your home system some protection in the off chance that your opponent decides to build his star system using the same two sizes of pieces as you, but it's usually not that big a deal early on. The second player has a slight advantage in knowing what the first player chose, and if he's confident, a red ship is often a good first choice for the 2nd player. One thing you will want to be sure of is to choose a large ship first, no matter what color it is. Starting with anything smaller puts you at a huge disadvantage.

2) Keith: Homeworld G3 Y2 B3
	CDRodeffer: Here, I picked a small yellow and a medium blue for my home binary system, and a large green for my flag ship. I can't attack anything, but even so, I can't be attacked by anything else unless you somehow get another large ship into my home system, which generally doesn't happen early in the game. A ship can only attack other ships if you have access to red (either by the star or one of your own ships) AND you're attacking a ship that's no larger than (but may be of equal size to) the largest ship you have in that system. Starting with a large green ship is commonly called "the investment" because it's the first step toward making a "factory" -- a formation of a large green and any other green ship in one system with no more greens in the supply that, via sacrifice, allows a player to build new ships anywhere you already occupy at double the rate normally possible.
	CDRodeffer: If you want to be aggressive, you could choose a small and a medium for your binary star, at least one of which should probably be yellow, and a large red ship. If you want to play a more positional game, any other size combination (small plus large or medium plus large) binary star system will give you a bit more space, since systems are only connected to other systems that they do NOT share a star in a common size.
	Keith: Yeow! Even the order submission has a learning curve.  Thank you for the help.  I will be rereading the rules and your advice.  Probably take my turn later this evening.

3) CDRodeffer: Build G1 Cdrodeffer
	Keith: I decided I wanted my homeworld to be able to create ships and move them out.  At least until a catasrophe comes along.  I decided to make my size three star green to pull a G3 out of the sacrifice pool you are getting a head start on.  I don't quite grasp the factory concept yet.  It seems that if you sacrifice size 3 greens you build ships at triple rate and size 2 ships produce double rate.
	CDRodeffer: Pulling the G3 out of the sacrifice pool, as you say, actually *helps* me on my way toward the factory, because it depends upon the eventual depletion of green ships. The way the factory works is I sacrifice the G3, immediately rebuild the G3 that I sacrificed in some system where I already have another green ship (this is important!), and then build two more ships of the same color as I have elsewhere. A bit on how the game often goes -- catastrophes are a big deal, and are much more common way to cause your opponent damage than merely attacking. Your large blue is a kind of a future trap for you. If you get *any* three ships into an important system, you can sacrifice the large blue and change them all to one color, then trigger a catastrophe. Since I'll have to have at least two green ships in one of my systems at all times (probably my home system) to make the factory work, this reduces your requirements to getting only two ships in to cause the catastrophe. Yellow ships are always mobile, so they're usually the ones to move in. My general strategy for defending against that would be to try to lock down the green and/or yellow economies to prevent you being able to change the color of the ships and/or move them into my vulnerable system in the first place. But for now, I have to complete my investment.

4) Keith: Build B1 Keith
	Keith: Does the green pool have to be completed for the factory to work?  Wouldn't it work as long as the one and two point ships were depleted?  Your comments on factories did clear up one misconception I had.  I had the idea that sacrificed ships went into the pool after the special actions were taken.  I.E. into the pool avialable to the other player on their turn.
	Keith: I just encountered a rule misreading on my part.  I tried to create a Y1 ship based on the idea that I had yellow in the system.  But it needs to be a yellow ship.  So the only real option I have this turn is to build another blue ship.

5) CDRodeffer: Trade G1 R1 Cdrodeffer
	CDRodeffer: Ah, yes. I made that mistake when I first started as well. You can only build a new ship (the smallest available) in the same color as one you already have in that system, and you must have access to green (either one of your own ships or a star). The rules are kind of brief, and could probably use more examples. As for your options, you could have traded your large blue for something else, but that would have immediately lost you a tempo. The first turn is almost always spent building, hence the necessity to have green somewhere. Another thing to think about is that it's almost always good to have access to all four colors in your home system, at least eventually. So I'll temporarily trade in my small green for a small red. This way, if you do manage to get a single ship into my home system, I can defend against it. I would not be able to defend against multiple ships, though, at least not yet.

6) Keith: Trade B1 R1 Keith
	CDRodeffer: Now I can build either red or green ships in CDRodeffer, the smallest of whichever is available. Likewise, you'll probably want to trade your small blue for something else. A red would maintain a sort of balance of power, but just as it is for me, it doesn't get me anywhere immediately, except able to defend against a home invasion of a single ship. Alternatively, you could start exploring, probably with your small blue. You could discover a new small world of any color.

7) CDRodeffer: Build G1 Cdrodeffer
	Keith: I will go with red too, though more for being four color than defensive.

8) Keith: Build B1 Keith

9) CDRodeffer: Trade G1 Y1 Cdrodeffer

10) Keith: Discover R1 Keith Y1 Maruko

11) CDRodeffer: Build Y2 Cdrodeffer

12) Keith: Trade B3 Y3 Keith
	Keith: Ahhh... I see I am in danger of getting locked out of yellow ships.

13) CDRodeffer: Build G1 Cdrodeffer
	CDRodeffer: No, you've never been in danger of that. Besides, yellow is one of the colors that always seems more readily available than some of the others, particularly blue and red. I'm just building up a few ships to get ready to go exploring.

14) Keith: Build B1 Keith
	Keith: I became concerned about yellow because 5 of the 9 were out of the pool (being all the one pointers and two of the two pointers).  I suppose I could have moved out of Maruko to put a y1 back in the pool.

15) CDRodeffer: Trade Y1 B1 Cdrodeffer

16) Keith: Build B2 Keith
	CDRodeffer: That would work too. Usually, two items of any one color is pretty safe for a home system, at least until your opponent gets two ships of that color up close and personal. But that usually takes a while, except in games where both players have home systems with the same sizes of stars, where only one system needs to be between them. So in normal games like ours, I usually try to build up a small fleet to build and then explore. Not everybody does this, and the game is new enough that I don't know if it's a viable long-term strategy or not. But my thinking is that having a few ships in a few different worlds gives me more choices for where to move. And in most other types of games, more choices is a good thing. Of course, I say that having lost most of the games of Homeworlds that I've ever played....
	Keith: The one potential drawback I noticed to Homeworlds being a game that works for me is the very short average game length of only 17 turns.  I tend to prefer games that have more drawn out opening and middle phases.  So I sort of hope your explore and develope strategy is a viable one.

17) CDRodeffer: Discover G1 Cdrodeffer Y3 College_fund
	CDRodeffer: I don't believe I've ever had a game last less than 30 moves, but I may be mistaken. It seems much longer and involved in practice, at least to me.

18) Keith: Trade B1 G1 Keith
	Keith: More turns, at least in this game, means more chances to learn so I am fine with that.  I do have a hypothetical question.  If my R1 moved to College_Fund wouldn't Maruko disappear and your G1 need to evacuate to avoid conversion?

19) CDRodeffer: Move R1 Cdrodeffer College_fund
	CDRodeffer: Ships with different owners may coexist in a system, at least for some time. So if you moved your R1 from Maruko to College_Fund, my G1 would be OK. Attacking takes an action, so provided I didn't evacuate, you could then attack my G1 if you wanted to. But the answer to your other question, yes, if a star is completely abandoned, it immediately returns to the stash.

20) Keith: Build Y1 Keith
	CDRodeffer: Or, if I move a red ship into College_Fund, it can defend against your attack by attacking first if you move your R1 in. This is because I'll have tempo there. Even had I not moved an R1 in, I could still have attacked by sacrificing my R1 elsewhere (it was originally in CDRodeffer, but could have been anywhere) to perform the attack. The difference between moving first for defense and sacrifice for defense is one small ship minus one tempo.
	Keith: Right.  Sacrificing allows actions in any system occupied.  Intellectually I know this but I don't see the possibilities yet when looking ahead.

21) CDRodeffer: Build Y2 Cdrodeffer

22) Keith: Sacrifice Y3 Keith
Move Y1 Keith Maruko
Move Y1 Maruko College_fund
Move Y1 College_fund Cdrodeffer
Catastrophe Cdrodeffer Yellow
	Keith: I am worried about you getting that y3.  My first thought was to move my r1 to Keith abandoning Maruko and putting a y1 in the pool.  However, at least for next turn, you can only build a y3 at CDRodeffer and I could sacrifice my Y3 to get a y1 there for a catastrophe... Right?
	Keith: This is more aggressive than I inended a learning game to be but I think I just saw a heavy hitting move.

23) CDRodeffer: Trade B1 Y1 Cdrodeffer
	CDRodeffer: I would not have been able to build the y3 anyway, at least for another couple of turns, because I aready had three yellow elements in CDRodeffer. A sacrifice such as this is usually better as a late game tactic than this early, because as you can see, it has left you with no large ships and no immediate way to get any, and it still doesn't give you any numerical advantage in terms of fleet size.

24) Keith: Trade B2 G2 Keith
	Keith: I see what you mean.  I can't even get a 2 pointer.  And I have not gained any functionality over you.  We both have all four colors.

25) CDRodeffer: Build G1 Cdrodeffer

26) Keith: Build B1 Keith

27) CDRodeffer: Build G2 College_fund

28) Keith: Move G2 Keith Maruko
	CDRodeffer: You know that you *are* allowed to trade a solitary blue ship in for one of another color, right? So even if you had not built the B1 in Keith, you could have traded it in for the available R1 or Y1.
	Keith: I do.  I was thinking that if I took a Y1, G2 or R1 you could take a Y2, G3 or R2.  From a stash point of view B1 was the safest to create.
	Keith: Actually there was another G2.  Taking a G2 would have put you one step closer to an operating factory.

29) CDRodeffer: Trade G1 Y1 Cdrodeffer
	CDRodeffer: It will be a while before I can bring the factory into operation.

30) Keith: Move B1 Keith Maruko

31) CDRodeffer: Build Y2 Cdrodeffer

32) Keith: Trade G2 Y2 Maruko

33) CDRodeffer: Sacrifice Y2 Cdrodeffer
Move Y1 Cdrodeffer Maruko
Move Y1 Cdrodeffer Maruko
Catastrophe Maruko Yellow
	CDRodeffer: I did not mean to hit the undo button. My three year old daughter is doing her best to make my computer time difficult.....

34) Keith: Trade G1 R1 Keith

35) CDRodeffer: Discover G2 College_fund Y1 Duckling
	Keith: I don't even remember what yellow ships I had in the Maruko system except a y2.

36) Keith: Build B1 Keith
	Keith: FWIW my learning game with TwoShort went 53 moves (27 turns).
	CDRodeffer: The Maruko system was a small yellow. But you also had at least two other ships in the system that were lost when it went nova. I should have warned you about that one, I think. Anyway, 53 moves isn't too short, I don't think. We'll see how this one goes. I won't try to intentionally draw things out, but it might take a while to finish things. Back to having four colors in your home system is a good place to be, even if the ships are small. I need to rebuild after that sacrifice, so while I'm ahead two ships in material, I'm behind in tempo in terms of protecting my home system.

37) CDRodeffer: Move G2 Duckling Keith

38) Keith: Build R1 Keith

39) CDRodeffer: Build R2 College_fund
	Keith: And then you grow one green a turn until there is a green catastrophe?

40) Keith: Build R2 Keith

41) CDRodeffer: Sacrifice R1 College_fund
Attack R2 Keith
	CDRodeffer: The grow green until a catastrophe is one way to go, but it ultimately wouldn't help me much other than to blow up one of your stars. You don't currently have any green ships in Keith, so the loss would be all mine. Your building an R1 in Keith was probably the only move that could save you, else I could have sacrificed R1 in College_Fund to attack your R1 in Keith, then simply used the next few turns to progressively attack your ships until you didn't control anything in your home system. In an annotated game, you get an exclamation point for building the R1 at just the right time. That move puts me behind an attack tempo. Had I done the sacrifice, you could just attack back with no loss, and I'd be out both a ship and a tempo, so I had to find another way. You have two R1 in Keith, which is soon going to become a liability. If you build R2 in Keith, there's no way you can stop me from eventually either building a B1 in CDRodeffer to sacrifice to change G2 to R2 for a red catastrophe or just moving my extra R1 from College_Fund in via some Y1 discovery as I did with the G2. But either of those is still at least two or three turns away. What can you do to turn my attention elsewhere?
	Keith: Since you have a g2 I can't attack and now a r2 it seems your in position to sacrifice the r2 and convert both of my r1s.  Then you convert one per turn there after using an r1 without sacrificing and I can only grow ships to stay ahead till I grow myself into a catastrophe.
	Keith: The other reason I can't grow an r2 is that you could convert it with your g2 and an r1 sacrifice.
	Keith: I could build a g1 threatening to eliminate your g2 and my green star with another green build.  But you could sacrifice your r2 and convert the g1 and ...
	CDRodeffer: Yes, you could do that. Losing green technology would be a bad thing for you, long term, but it might be one way to save yourself in the short term. You could build R2 and hope that I don't capture both of your B1 ships, then change one of your ships to green (red or blue, I don't see how it would really matter), then build another G1 to cause the catastrophe. Hmmm. As an aside, I wonder -- would sacrificing multiple ships, even if they are not used, fall within the rules? Probably not, but it's an effective, if costly, way to prevent either a catastrophe or your opponent taking control of something. Better no one have something than your enemy sort of thing, the scorched earth retreat. Have you considered exploring with one of your blue ships? I haven't thought about it much, but it might be a way to do something. If you're willing to intentionally move toward a red catastrophe in your home system, you can go ahead and build the R2 -- even with my R2 sacrifice I could only take two of the ships, then you could build another and cause the red catastrophe on the following turn. It would leave me with only one R1 available to go after one of your B1 ships, but you'd still be "alive" as such.
	Keith: It seems to me that if I do move a B1 out you just sacrifice your R2 and convert both of my R1s.  Then I must grow a b1 every turn to stay ahead of the one per turn conversion rate of the R1s.  Eventually I catastrophy myself with blue growth.

42) Keith: Trade B1 G1 Keith

43) CDRodeffer: Discover G2 Keith Y1 Lonely_retreat
	Keith: Well that is pretty much that.  Awhile back you wrote " What can you do to turn my attention elsewhere?"  Did you have something in mind?

44) Keith: Build R1 Keith
Catastrophe Keith Red

45) CDRodeffer: Build R1 College_fund

46) Keith: Build B1 Keith
	CDRodeffer: Since this is a learning game, winning or losing doesn't matter, so I thought it might be fun to give us both some leeway to try out some ideas. Sound OK to you?

47) CDRodeffer: Move R2 College_fund Cdrodeffer
	Keith: Sounds good to me.  I certainly learned a good lesson about overextending too early to remove your homeworld's binary status.  And the value of three-pointers.  
	Keith: And the value of two pointers...

48) Keith: Trade B1 R1 Keith

49) CDRodeffer: Trade R2 B2 Cdrodeffer

50) Keith: Discover G1 Keith Y1 Bab4

51) CDRodeffer: Build B1 Cdrodeffer

52) Keith: Build B1 Keith

53) CDRodeffer: Trade B1 Y1 Cdrodeffer

54) Keith: Move B1 Keith Bab4

55) CDRodeffer: Move B2 Cdrodeffer College_fund
	CDRodeffer: The type of tactic I've been using the past few turns is to try to prevent you from having access to medium sized pieces, by whatever means necessary. It includes trading and building the ships as they become available, but mainly it involves leaving small ships in the supply as possible, preferably only one small ship per color that you have available to build. That way when you build a small, I have access to a medium immediately, which I could then sacrifice (if needed) before you have a chance to move any medium you could build.
	Keith: And its working.  Mediums continue to elude me for the moment.

56) Keith: Build B1 Keith

57) CDRodeffer: Build Y2 Cdrodeffer

58) Keith: Build B2 Bab4

59) CDRodeffer: Build B3 College_fund
	CDRodeffer: Great! Now that you're in position to get medium pieces, I can try to prevent your access to large pieces, while trying to secure them for myself. The keys to this sort of economic manipulation are first, to leave only ONE piece of the lower size available and second, to have at least two places where you can build the next larger size once pieces once they become available. Do you see how this is going to work out? Right now you can't build yellow, but in two turns you might be able to trade for a y2 if you decide to go that route (say build b2 Bab4 then trade b2 y2 Bab4). It would be risky for you to build b2 or b3 in Keith at the moment, at least while I have a y2 available for, say, sacrifice y2, move b2 College_Fund - Bab4 - Keith, catastrophe blue Keith. But you can (for now) either safely build blue in Bab4, or -- discover a new system somewhere. Yellow has become a bit of a strange resource in this game, which is a strange game anyway because we're not really playing to win or lose, but to learn tactics. But anyway, note that all of the star systems except CDRodeffer now have yellow suns. For mobility, I'm dependent on having at least one yellow ship in CDRodeffer. Right now there are two, but that may suggest a possible avenue of attack for you....
	Keith: The lack of a yellow ship has felt odd.  I have seen comments in other games about the difficulty of being locked out of yellow.  Though really I have just been yellow impaired.  I did put a b1 out at Bab4 so that when I got the B1s out of the way I could safely build a B2 there.
	Keith: Thank you for the extended teaching game.  With Cannon now down and out for a month it has been nice to explore Homeworlds.  I have certainly learned about the disadvantage of going without a large ship (or a medium ship).
	Keith: It does seem that if I build a B2 at Bab4 then I could not safely follow with a B3 at either Bab4 or Keith.  So I guess I will move out another b1 givng me at least two safe grow systems.
	Keith: Wait.... I can only discover a G1 or R1 both of which put you in line for a medium ship.  Hmmmm...

60) Keith: Move B1 Bab4 Cdrodeffer
	CDRodeffer: But building the b2 leaves a very tasty b3 for me to build as well. Of course, you can also now, and we'll both be in positions where we can trade it for any other large ship we need at the time. This is a good sort of combination to work toward -- a large ship of any color and access to both blue and yellow somewhere in the system. That's why that particular combination of colors is most recommended for the home system at the beginning of the game. It's both mobile and easy to change.

61) CDRodeffer: Sacrifice R1 College_fund
Attack B1 Cdrodeffer

62) Keith: Move B2 Bab4 Cdrodeffer

63) CDRodeffer: Trade B1 R1 Cdrodeffer
	CDRodeffer: If I understand your plans correctly (move b2 Bab4 CDRodeffer, sacrifice g1 Bab4 to grow another blue in CDRodeffer), then I need some way to get rid of these pesky blue aliens....

64) Keith: Sacrifice R1 Keith
Attack R1 Cdrodeffer
	Keith: Right about the B2.  Also I did not feel I could safely build a B3 in Bab4.  Now I can.  If you build a second B3 you will have three blue elements in either College fund or CDRodeffer and I can create a catasrophe.
	Keith: Though I suppose if I do build the B3 you can sacrifice the Y2 and move two B1s in.

65) CDRodeffer: Trade G3 R3 Cdrodeffer

66) Keith: Attack Y2 Cdrodeffer
	CDRodeffer: There is almost always another way to block slow (i.e., one ship at a time) invasions from leading to a catastrophe. Here's one of them.

67) CDRodeffer: Attack R1 Cdrodeffer
	CDRodeffer: Now, at most you can build one more blue in CDRodeffer, but I'll eventually take them both over if you do. I also could have simply moved the ship out of the system, or better, discovered a new system with the b1, probably a g3 to try to deny you access to green technology. Building a b3 in Bab4 probably would have been a better move for you. Sure, I could have sacrificed y2 to move in two blue ships from College_Fund, but it would have cost me three ships (two mediums and a large) and you only two (one medium and one large). If it had been in your home system, it may have been worth it, but usually not in an external system.
	Keith: And it puts a B1 back in the pool.

68) Keith: Discover Y2 Cdrodeffer G1 Greenleaf

69) CDRodeffer: Attack B2 Cdrodeffer
	Keith: I did consider the B3 in Bab4.  I even tried it and took it back.  While it is true you would have lost three ships to my two you would have ended up with two large ships, out numbering me overall, and I would have only 4 small ships.
	Keith: I did not think of your large ship going red.
	Keith: I think I needed to have a green medium in hand before starting this sequence.  Before to threaten to grow to blue ships.  Now to threaten to grow two red ones.

70) Keith: Build G2 Bab4

71) CDRodeffer: Move B2 Cdrodeffer Lonely_retreat

72) Keith: Sacrifice B1 Keith
Trade B1 R1 Keith

73) CDRodeffer: Move B2 Lonely_retreat Keith

	CDRodeffer: You're in a tough spot, Keith. I could sacrifice r1 CDRodeffer to simply attack r1 Keith, and even if you sacrifice g2 Bab4 to grow two more red ships (r1 and r2) in Keith, I could instead sacrifice r3 CDRodeffer to get all three. So anyway, given that this game isn't rated, would you rather end it or continue and explore more tactics?
	CDRodeffer: Hmm. If you had one more tempo, you could sacrifice g2 Bab4 to build y2 and y3 in Greenleaf, then move the y3 to Keith. I'd need a large ship to attack that, and the nearest is two steps away.
	Keith: I think we can wrap this up.  It has been very helpful to me.  Thank you very much.  I have my first chance to apply what I have learned right now in my game against Cobalt.  I can sacrifice a Y2 to move a G1 to his homeworld where I can trigger a disaster taking out all of his green including one star.  I would still have a Y3 at my homeworld.  However, I would only have two ships left to his four.
	Keith: I will look over this game again tomorrow morning sometime and then resign.
