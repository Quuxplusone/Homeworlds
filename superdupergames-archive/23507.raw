1) SimonDorfman: Homeworld R2 B3 G3
	SimonDorfman: i'm not sure why our last game ended. did you resign? or run out of time? i can't say i have a grasp of this game at all, but i'd like to continue to try it.

2) SilentTitan: Homeworld R1 B2 G3

4) SilentTitan: Build G1 Silenttitan

5) SimonDorfman: Trade G3 Y3 Simondorfman
	SimonDorfman: I tried doing this "discover g1 simondorfman r3 willywonka" and got this message "You do not have access to propulsion technology (YELLOW) in this sector." so i tried this "build y1 simondorfman" and got this message "To build a new ship you must already control one of the same colour (Y)."

6) SilentTitan: Trade G1 Y1 Silenttitan
	SimonDorfman: okay, i'm starting to get it...

7) SimonDorfman: Discover G1 Simondorfman R1 Willywonka

8) SilentTitan: Build G1 Silenttitan

9) SimonDorfman: Build G1 Willywonka
	SimonDorfman: I feel like I need to make a spreadsheet map of how to get to your home world... Hard to do on my phone...

10) SilentTitan: Discover G1 Silenttitan Y3 Sol

11) SimonDorfman: Sacrifice G1 Willywonka
Build Y1 Simondorfman
	SimonDorfman: i pretty much messed this up. not sure what i should do. can't seem to think of any useful moves that i can do. any suggestions?
	SilentTitan: you could sacrifice a g1 in willywonka and build a y1 in simondorfman. then trade the y1 to a g1 next turn.

22) SilentTitan: Sacrifice Y3 Silenttitan
Move G3 Sol Willywonka
Move G3 Willywonka Simondorfman
Discover Y1 Silenttitan G3 Tic
	SilentTitan: ok.. so you are in a position that is overextended.  you do not have a Battleship (3-pip) in your homeworld and I can reach it with a battle ship by sacrificing the Y3 in my homeworld. There are considering issues like. Would I be able to take all ships in your homeworld before you'd be able to remove me. Doubtful as you could just sac the G3 in willy and build two more of the ships in your homeworld build the one you just sacked back into willy and then cat green in your homeworld.  Can you see what I'm talking about or should we do it as a practical exercise and start again?
	SimonDorfman: I'm not fully understanding so I'd like to play this to the end and then play again.
	SilentTitan: ok

23) SimonDorfman: Build Y1 Willywonka

24) SilentTitan: Attack G2 Simondorfman North

	SilentTitan: I was able to attack you because the "planets" in the system give the technology to everyone in the system.  
	SimonDorfman: shoot, sorry i let it run out of time. thanks for your efforts to teach me this game. i haven't really gotten it yet, but i may sit down and try to play a game in person with a friend sometime.
