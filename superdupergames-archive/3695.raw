Gort: I thought your previous "undid" move was mugh better. I couldn't figure out an appropriate response.

24) zoltar: Trade Y1 G1 Zoltar
zoltar: Oh, that was an oversight. I was afraid that you would destroy one of my homeworld stars if I did the first move. I had a Y1 and Y2 and a Y1 star in my homeworld. If I sac my G2 and build Y2 and Y3 in the hydra system, my green tech was safe, but now I was afraid you would trade your G2 for a y2, but all the y2s were used up and I only realized that after I changed the move. A silly oversight on my part.
Gort: it's cool. You'll get me in the end. I can sense a disturbance in the fork. :)

25) Gort: Move R2 Gort Hydra

26) zoltar: Sacrifice Y1 Hydra
Move Y2 Hydra Zoltar

zoltar: I've already screwed up terribly. I'm probably quite lost, and it won't take my move back again. If I make another ridiculous mistake I'll resign so we can start over and I can give you a real game.
Gort: OK, though I still think you had some options. Never give up! Gort makes mistakes, too! Anyway, Zoltar had Gort on the ropes there for a while. Our robot gaurdians will be kind to your people.
zoltar: In the middle game I wouldn't give up, but it was the opening and I'd put you four moves ahead, and I'm a beginner so I need the practise and would rather not waste time and just start again, which is what I'd ask to do in an over the board game.
