	hellajoey: How's it going, Larry? How's eBay treating you? I heard a rumor there was some downsizing.

52) hellajoey: Trade G1 Y1 Star
	Grissom: Hi Joey, I am doing well. eBay is great, classifieds was not effected by the down sizing. I was converted so I am enjoying officially being on the team.

	hellajoey: Things are pretty good. Also pretty strange. I haven't actually been doing any Android development since I left eBay and I think I need to get back into it by EOS (end of Spring ;) at the latest. I'm glad to hear things are going well for you still at eBay. I accidentally met the new Product Manager for Classifieds at a dance club a couple weeks ago (another strange story). She seemed cool. But when I heard there was downsizing (did you really lose the 3rd floor?) I was feeling bad for you guys. Nice to hear things are still good.
	Grissom: Ya we are on 9 now. It is different but I feel like it has been good for the team. Also they started catering breakfast every day and that has been great.
