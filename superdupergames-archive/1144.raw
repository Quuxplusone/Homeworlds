Homeworlds Online (SDG# 1144)
Started: 2005.11.1, Ended: 2006.2.2
Participants: lambda (S), Jesse (N)
Winner: Jesse

1) Jesse: Homeworld G2 B1 Y3

2) lambda: Homeworld Y3 B2 G3
	Jesse: On the small, blue-green world of Jesse, the peaceful Jesseans prepare to embark on a grand journey of exploration.  Are they alone in the universe?  Only time, and a giant radio telescope, will tell.

3) Jesse: Build Y1 Jesse
	lambda: The Lambdites are a peaceable people of traders. Having discovered a hyperspace portal right in their system, they decide to start building a fleet of ships to send into the great beyond. Who know what sorts of alien races they'll find, and what amazing technologies they'll gain in trade?

4) lambda: Build G1 Lambda
	Jesse: Well, now this is really quite astonishing!  Jessean scientists have discovered a primitive radio signal from an alien civilization only a few thousand light years away.  It is entirely possible that they are now at a comparable level of technology to our own.  Debate has begun as to whether we should initiate contact with them.

5) Jesse: Discover Y1 Jesse G3 Sekhar
	lambda: The United Council of Merchants, the governing body of the Lambdites, opens a new market for speculation on what will be found as the galaxy is explored. Shares in "little green things from outer space" hit 100Y, while "buxom space blondes" are down at 1.34Y. A few enterprising engineers begin building sensor networks to try and scan the stars, in order to give them a better edge at playing the market.

6) lambda: Discover G1 Lambda B1 Arrakis
	Jesse: Following recent advances in hyperdrive technology, it is now possible to send an exploratory probe on a deep space mission to learn more about these mysterious Lambdites.  It is possible we may even be able to make contact within our lifetime!  Quantum entanglement communications from the probe indicate that Lambdite civilization did indeed survive the crucial nuclear-industrial period of development, with some fascinating technologies appropriate to their planet's climate.  Furthermore, the probe has discovered a colonizable planet rich in resources.  A research and production facility is now being built on planet Sekhar, name after the inventor of the hyperdrive that made its colonization possible.
	Jesse: Even with hyperdrive, space travel is still a long, slow process.  As the years pass, the Jessean population grows restless and discontented with the current administration's lackadaisical attitude toward the colonization of space.

7) Jesse: Build Y1 Jesse
	lambda: [my apologies for taking so long; I got busy with school and burnt out on Homeworlds at the same time]
The Radio Corporation of Atlantia ends up being the first to discover a signal from an extra-Lambestial life form. The folks running the futures market are stumped as to what to do, as they haven't issued any shares in Jesseans. They finally decide that Jesseans fall under the category of "lumpy, hairy things", solving that problem neatly. The UCM decides to begin colonization of the galaxy, in order to make contact with the Jesseans and bilk them for all they're worth... er, we mean trade with them for everyone's mutual benefit! In that vein, they send one of their ships out, to form a small trading colony. 
	Jesse: [I understand.  I'm glad you came back.  I'll be back to this game in a bit, it just takes a certain frame of mind that I'm not in right now.]

8) lambda: Build G1 Arrakis
	Jesse: A generation of decadent culture passes.  At long last, President Xanax is elected on a platform of renewed industrial and scientific development.  The first new ship rolls off the production lines, and communication is reestablished with the colony on Sekhar.

9) Jesse: Build Y1 Sekhar
	lambda: In a bizarre coincidence, the Lambdites find the remains of an ancient civilization on the planet they've chosen as a trading outpost. It turns out that the glassy planet was once composed of vast, sandy deserts, where this civilization of these funny looking soft pink things called "humans" once lived. In honor of the fallen race, the Lambdites name the planet Arrakis. They begin doing a survey of the stars to try and find the one named "Hume" that these humans must have come from. While they're at it, they decide to get ready for trade, producing some more of their excellent construction vessels and sending advertisements for them all across the galaxy. 
	lambda: [Yeah, doing a roleplaying game of Homeworlds can be tough, since you have to be thinking both strategically and creatively at the same time. Oh, and that last bit of story a quick patch to the fact that I reflexively used my standard naming convention for systems, which is names of actual stars]

	Jesse: The Sekhar colony is proven viable by the successful completion of a new ship at its production facilities.  Jesseans celebrated the news at State sponsored events throughout the two systems.  A few unpatriotic individuals held a small, half-hearted demonstration outside the J House.  Happily, the majority of Jesseans dismiss their protestations as almost a non-event.  "It just goes to show," commented one keen observer, "that President Xanax's landslide victory really does represent a true mandate of the masses.  A few decadents from the Green Love Party won't get in the way of the President's agenda of progress."
	Jesse: Well, I think that's long enough.  I'm canceling this game now.
