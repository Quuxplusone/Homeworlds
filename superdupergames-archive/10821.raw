Homeworlds Online (SDG# 10821)
Started: 2008.4.1, Ended: 2008.7.25
Participants: Keith (S), wyons (N)
Winner: wyons

1) wyons: Homeworld B3 R1 G3

2) Keith: Homeworld Y1 B2 G3
	wyons: since we have been talking so much about all this I thought it would be good to try it and see. Also I dont think we have ever played any other game appart from GR. Hope your computer woes are over.
	Keith: A good idea.  I see you have risen through the ranks rather quickly.  You seem to have quickly become one of the sophisticated strategists.  I remember reading about those starting position/play styles once though I have not put any real effort into understanding them.  It is probably something I need to do if I am ever to break out of the group that lags behind the top tier of players by 100 to 150 points.
	Keith: My computer woes may be over by this weekend.  It will probably be a day before I make my opening move.

3) wyons: Build G1 Wyons

4) Keith: Build G1 Keith
	wyons: so many considerations for the first move, then the second move is forced...
	Keith: It is an odd element of the design.  Things do tend to pick up quickly after that though we will probably see a few low tension turns before fighting for control of the stash makes things interesting.

5) wyons: Trade G1 Y1 Wyons
	Keith: "... I remember reading about those starting position/play styles once..."  
 
I took a second look.  I am the one that posted it to the wiki!

6) Keith: Trade G1 Y1 Keith
	wyons: Interesting- I think I may have read what your wrote. Homeworlds is an awesome game I think- full of unexpected twists. Sometimes when I am losing if I stare at it for long enough suddenly a completely unexpected escape pops up that has been staring me in the face but which I just did not see...
	Keith: Actually I did not write it, Zoltar did in a game that I was monitoring.  I just posted it.  
 
I don't think of my start in terms of Banker.  I think g3 ship can I crank a factory.  I only remember banking a ship once.  FWIW my event horizon is probably only about 3 to 5 ply.  I go on gut as much as anything and it easy with all the possibilities to overlook something.

7) wyons: Build Y2 Wyons

8) Keith: Build Y2 Keith

9) wyons: Build Y2 Wyons

10) Keith: Discover Y1 Keith G3 Geeliwan
	wyons: I only usually go to about 3 ply aswell. Given that once this game is underway there must be around 40+ options each ply we are talking 40 cubed for a three ply search (76,000!). The only hope is to prune the tree and this is where gut/intuition comes in. I dont like it when games are purely logical. See my entry under too many options (towards the end): http://forums.superdupergames.org/viewtopic.php?t=648&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=90&sid=b6d6be28a3f0a06b6d9661c4011b075e

11) wyons: Discover Y1 Wyons G2 Greengenie

12) Keith: Build Y3 Geeliwan
	Keith: I looked up your post.  That topic was one of the most interesting discussions in the forums.  I tracked it all the way through page 6 but had missed your input.  It helped me decide the move I just made in my Cannon tournament game against Meadmaker.  I was in a situation of being able to decide to initiate an exchange of cannon fire or to initiate both sides moving to avoid the cannon fire.  I played out on a physical board half a dozen moves ahead then mentally looked another 4 to 6 ply beyond that.  I did not see any advantage looking 10 to 12 ply forward between cannon fire or avoidence.  This is where your post comes in.  After reading it I went with the move that my gut said would make more of a difference in the end game, which is probably 20 moves or more down the line.

13) wyons: Build Y3 Greengenie
	wyons: good, I am glad it might have been helpful. Guts arent always right of course! By the way I finally cracked around offering a prize for GR (forums, general)

14) Keith: Move Y1 Geeliwan Greengenie
	Keith: Saw that.  Sent you an email via my litigation email address.

15) wyons: Discover Y1 Greengenie Y3 Mellowyellow

20) Keith: Build Y2 Geeliwan
	Keith: So far in the game I have been working to avoid having stash troubles rather than to give you stash troubles.  My gut says I need to be careful on the next move but I have not had a good chunk of sit down and think time.

21) wyons: Build G1 Wyons

22) Keith: Build G1 Keith
	wyons: yes, it certainly seems to take 'sit down and think time' - there are so many twists and turns..

Attack R1S Mellowyellow

	Keith: maybe not.
	Keith: I was originally okay with your being able to build a red two.  My thought being that could sacrifice a yellow three and make one home system star and all of your reds go boom.  I failed to factor in that your homeworld would then be only one system away from mine.  You can then sacrifice your yellow three and make my greens go away.  You then have a 3-pointer and I don't.  Can't be good.

32) Keith: Move B1 Keith Geeliwan
	wyons: I agree with your analysis. I think it is rarely good going for a home star. :)

	Keith: Ahem!  Well at least I am better off than if I had done the red catstrophe.  Not much, but better off.
 
Well I would have it you would have ended up two systems away.  a 3-pointer and a 1-pointer for two 2-pointers and a home star would have been worth it.

	Keith: I am slowly going under here.  Four 3-pointers to two. 
	Keith: Perhaps three to two but given that you are spread out over three sectors with yours to my one I am going to run into trouble adding 3-pointers before you will.

53) wyons: Discover Y3 Greengenie G1 Dewshine
	Keith: I mean four to three.  Ghaaa.  I can't think straight anymore.

54) Keith: Move R3 Keith Geeliwan
	wyons: I think you are right in assessing that 3-pointers are crucial. It seems to be far more important to have one 3-pointer -say- than several smaller ones..

62) Keith: Move G1 Keith Geeliwan
	wyons: I did, but I havent had a chance to study it yet as its at home (and I seem to be living at work at present!)
	Keith: No problem.  I did not expect feedback on it yet.  I am just not sure what email gets through to you.  At one time email from my personal account was not making it through.

	Keith: As long as you don't make a critical error you are going to win this one.  Your play has been sharper than mine all the way through.

	wyons: thanks for your emails. I havent had time to study them yet.
	Keith: Your welcome.
 
I am still consistently failing to see ply ahead.

	Keith: My Homeworlds fu has become weak while yours has become strong.  I am just dragging things out at this point.  Well done.
 
Grim Reaper weekend for me.  The family is out of the country and I have only a bathroom's worth of wallpapering to do.  I hae probably gotten 80% of the improvement I am going to be able to get with the limited look ahead and two of my five evaluation elements having some accuracy issues.  I am hoping that playing a bunch of games this weeked, instead of watching them be played, will give me the information for squeezing out the remaining 20% of possible improvement.
	wyons: Many thanks for the game and I dont blame you for resigning! The GR outcomes should be interesting.
