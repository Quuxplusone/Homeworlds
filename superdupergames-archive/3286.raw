	Hedge_o_Matic: Huh.  That's funny.  I did it right the first time.
	Hedge_o_Matic: Hopefully I'll give you a better game than the last one we played.  What a disaster that was!
	Hedge_o_Matic: Oh, and I'm considering a run on Icehouse pieces to coplete my set before the full stashes go away... I just need Orange, Cyan, Purple and White, and I'll be complete.  That, plus my solid brass and steel set I've got a friend milling for me...  weight is everything in Icehouse, after all.
