	Draw5PlayAll: Since you made no effort to clear the attackers and they were green, they decided to build a new ship to cause the catastrophe.
 
However, it appears that you will win by a one-move margin. The only way I could stop you is to hammer you with reds but I'd need 2-3 turns to do anything useful.
