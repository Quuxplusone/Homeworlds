	zoltar: Well, I hope you enjoy it. I learned in June, and lost my first dozen games or so, and then got pretty good at it. The hardest tactics to learn are the sacrifices, because they look strange at first and it's easy to overlook them. This has become my favorite game here, and I think it's a wonderful chess-like game.
	mjbuyck: ...oops.
>_<
	zoltar: Btw, the first rule is to never, ever abandon your homeworld. :) Also, even if you had other ships, it's usually very bad to leave your homeworld without a 3-pip sized ship defending it at all times. While usually you can undo your move, there is a flaw in the program, so that if you blow up your homeworld like that, you can't take it back.   Want to start over and try again?
	mjbuyck: Just did with your other open challenge.
