11) Mathematician42: Trade B1 R1 Mathematician42
	wil: No not at all, is he there?
	Mathematician42: It's a module for want of a better world where you can download modules to play board games in real time.

12) wil: B B1 Wil
	wil: Yeah, I looked, is thre an hw  module?

13) Mathematician42: Build R1 Mathematician42
	Mathematician42: no
	Mathematician42: no
	Mathematician42: IDK how to make one

14) wil: D B2 Wil Y3 Y3
	Mathematician42: Is pyramid arcade worth the $74?
	Draw5PlayAll: I looked at the vassal thing... seems old and outdated, forum seems to have little that is 2018/2019.
	Draw5PlayAll: As for Arcade, it really depends.
	wil: I play a lot of pyramid games..Yes4me
	wil: In 5.hw  games right now
	Mathematician42: Is it possible to play Zendo with Pyramid Arcade?

15) Mathematician42: Discover R1 Mathematician42 R2 R2
	Mathematician42: @Draw5PlayAll: VASSAL is great for X-wing Miniatures. In fact, they had an update not so long ago
	Mathematician42: To be fair SDG looks old and outdated

	Draw5PlayAll: Zendo with Arcade: Not without squirming a bit. Zendo is only good when you have several of each piece to pick from, otherwise supply limits become a problem.
	Mathematician42: I see. What if I already have two old treehouse sets where one is missing the blue trio?
	Draw5PlayAll: That is fine, since you get 5 trios of red, green, yellow, and black. Now you just need 20-40 chips each of three colors.
	Mathematician42: Great! Thanks for the info
	Draw5PlayAll: You also get Blam, Icehouse, and a few other interesting games with 5 trees of each color. The Arcade booklet has some games listed in the back that require 15 pieces of a given color
	Mathematician42: Awesome! As a 14 year old with a dad who is a board game enthusiast, we have a lot of games and not much space to store them which means we might not be able to get it. lol
	wil: Sdg is old and out dated, we will play
	Mathematician42: @D5PA: I have challenged you to a game of Martian Chess

17) Mathematician42: Build R1 Mathematician42
