Homeworlds Online (SDG# 17480)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2010.9.25, Ended: 2010.9.29
Participants: dlwillson (S), Keith (N)
Winner: dlwillson

1) Keith: Homeworld B1 Y2 G3

2) dlwillson: H B3 R1 G3
	Keith: You have a good track record in Homeworlds.
	dlwillson: I love Icehouse games. Homeworlds and Zendo are my favorites.

3) Keith: Build G1 Keith
	Keith: There has been some very clever use of the Icehouse pieces.  Homeworlds being a great example.  I never had any desire to play Zendo though I appreciate it from a design point of view.

4) dlwillson: B G1 Dlwillson

5) Keith: Trade G1 Y1 Keith

6) dlwillson: T G1 Y1 Dlwillson
	dlwillson: Good move. Trade to red might have been better for diversity and lockout potential.

7) Keith: Build G1 Keith
	Keith: Thought about both red and blue.

8) dlwillson: Build G1 Dlwillson
	Keith: I was pretty sure another green would have been a bad idea.
	dlwillson: Actually, either of those are good race colors for you, but red is better for three reasons:
- I ~have~ to get in, or find a way to catch up later.
- You have more room for red, and you don't have red.
- I have less room for red, and I don't have yellow. Or, didn't have, so I'd certainly lose the red race, no matter what.

9) Keith: Build Y1 Keith
	dlwillson: A second little green is a fine idea, unless it pushes the other guy into mediums, by the way.
We're both looking fine on yellow. You might want to consider a second yellow ship. I can't currently reach you, and you could split them up and burst-build with your G3.
	Keith: A burst build building all yellow to regain a 3- pointer?
 
I wasn't that worried about having a red.  Yours is a planet so while it is good for defense I don't feel like I have a gun pointed at me.  Though that is focus on what is in play rather than stack management.

10) dlwillson: B Y2 Dlwillson

11) Keith: Discover Y1 Keith B3 Miranda

12) dlwillson: D Y2 Dlwillson B2 Nuts

13) Keith: Sacrifice G3 Keith
Build Y2 Miranda
Build Y3 Miranda
Build Y3 Keith
	dlwillson: Ok, the yellow rush is not currently an option...
	Keith: Well let me see if I understand what would happen.  If I sacrificed the G3 I would need to build Y2 and Y3 in Miranda and Y3 in Keith.  If you could then move nuts to Miranda and cause a catastrophe.  But if you do that I will have swapped my G3 for a Y3 and you will lose your Y2.  If you instead build a Y3, I disperse and keep my gain.  We both will have gained a Y3 and  Y2.  Won't you then be capped at two yellow?
 
This may blow up in my face.  The advantage of an unrated game is that I am free to try.

14) dlwillson: B Y3 Dlwillson
	Keith: Make that three yellow.

15) Keith: Sacrifice Y1 Miranda
Discover Y1 Keith G3 Midworld
	dlwillson: You're absolutely right on all counts. I pushed up the wrong yellow! I don't usually make mistakes like that... In this case, I'm glad I did. Onward!
	Keith: So now you can sacrifice the Y3 and get a yellow to Keith causing a catastrophe.  I need to do something about that and Miranda is subject to loss.  
	Keith: ... though if I lose Miranda you will have two 3-pointers to my one.  Need to save Miranda too.
	Keith: Most of the game is coming back to me, though I am not seeing but two moves ahead.

16) dlwillson: D Y1 Dlwillson G2 Berries

17) Keith: Build Y1 Midworld
	dlwillson: I donÂ’t think I've ever seen more than two ahead... but I definitely play with 1 eye on the bank.

18) dlwillson: M G1 Dlwillson Nuts

19) Keith: Discover Y1 Midworld B2 Lv-426
	Keith: One of the reasons I like Cannon is because I can see far ahead.
 
No clear idea what to do here.  

20) dlwillson: Build G1 Dlwillson

21) Keith: Trade Y3 R3 Miranda
	dlwillson: So, my way of getting around that is to decide how I'm going to take the other guy out at the very beginning of the game, then, anytime there's no immediate pressure, I move something toward that goal. It seems to work OK so far. In friendly games, I mostly just play the game and see what happens.
	Keith: Interesting bind you have me in.  If I build a green you can sacrifice your G3 and build to you get it back.  If I trade a yellow you can grab it.

22) dlwillson: Build Y3 Berries
	dlwillson: So, you offered the Y3 anyway... Interesting. Let's see if you have a plan.

23) Keith: Move R3 Miranda Berries
	Keith: Because I am brain dead.  Was going to offer the Y2, decided I might have some problems down the line, switched to the Y3 forgetting the you get it issue.

24) dlwillson: M Y3 Berries Miranda
	dlwillson: I've done that! Solution: read the board before and after the move. :-)

25) Keith: Attack Y1 Berries

26) dlwillson: T G1 R1 Dlwillson

27) Keith: Build R1 Berries

28) dlwillson: M R1 Dlwillson Nuts
	dlwillson: I won my ladder match!

29) Keith: Trade Y3 R3 Keith
	Keith: Congratulations.  I see you are now starting to tackle the big league group.  Wyons is a strong player.

30) dlwillson: B Y3 Nuts

	dlwillson: I've played the top 3 guys in regular games. Didn't win a single one... I better get better,eh?
	Keith: Yep. There used to be two groups.  The 4 or 5 heavies at the top of the ladder and a second group of 4 or 5 about 80 to 120 rating points back.  While I got Zoltar once, I never broke out of the seconddary group and then just about stopped playing when my focus shifted to Grim Reaper.
	Keith: Gah!  I was thinking you could not build the Y3 in dlwilson so I was safe.
	dlwillson: Want to call this one and start another?
	Keith: Maybe, I will let you know.  Board game night.  I will be out all evening.  I will take a look when I get back in.
	Keith: I am going to call it.
