	stoneaxe: You would just catastrophe me if I did that last move, but I think I need to do something drastic like that.
	stoneaxe: too late for it now I guess.

43) stoneaxe: Move R2 Kronos Live
	stoneaxe: I suppose the lesson  "never move the 3 pointer out of your HW" has to be learned somehow.  That will teach me.
	wyons: yes, I think that must be another one to me. But this match was tougher than the last and I am happy to play again if you wish... :)
	wyons: no, I spoke too soon! I thought i could sacrifice my r3 ship and take over your three little ones, but of course, once it is sacrificed there isnt a ship in the sytem so the red cant operate..so the fight continues!!
