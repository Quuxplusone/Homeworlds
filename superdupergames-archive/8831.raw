Participants: MikeYarrum (S), Freemonty (N)
Winner: MikeYarrum

1) Freemonty: Homeworld Y2 G1 R3 *
	Freemonty: look, I'm new with this system. Seince I tried playing I can't get it to make my first move. Is there something that I don't know, or am I just putting in the commands wrong? You might not know the answer to that Question.

2) MikeYarrum: Homeworld G3 Y1 B3
	Freemonty: ignore my first comment. I'm a N00b, it might show in my move.
	MikeYarrum: No problem, it takes awhile to get used to, but it'll become second-nature soon.

3) Freemonty: Build R1 Freemonty

4) MikeYarrum: Build B1 Mikeyarrum
	Freemonty: Is it just standard convention to start with green/blue, or are there other ways to start? [look at my starting position]
	MikeYarrum: Actually, it's highly recommended that you start with both green and blue, whether it's in your homeworld or your ship. Some advanced players like to start with green/blue/red and trade for yellow ASAP, but most start with green/blue/yellow and trade for red later. The problem with your set-up is, if you want any other color ship besides red, you're going to have to discover a blue star system, then trade for other colors besides red, and then possibly move them back to your homeworld. It's not very efficient. I, on the other hand, can build and trade more easily with my setup.
 
Don't worry, it takes a game or two to see the strategy in establishing a homeworld. Try reading the SDG wiki and any other pages you can find on the game.

5) Freemonty: Discover R1 Freemonty B3 Sevensevenseven

6) MikeYarrum: Trade B1 R1 Mikeyarrum
	Freemonty: Ok. I guess we'll see how this ends up then.

7) Freemonty: Trade R1 B1 Sevensevenseven

	Freemonty: I hope this rectifies my mistake.
	MikeYarrum: It's going to take more than that, I'm afraid. Without yellow ships to sacrifice, that blue ship is pretty much stuck there. It might have made sense if you traded for green, so you could build more green ships then trade for other colors, but you'd still be playing catch-up against me.
 
I wouldn't mind ending this game and starting another, if you want a fair shot.
	Freemonty: Sounds fair to me. [last time I argue with a computer]
