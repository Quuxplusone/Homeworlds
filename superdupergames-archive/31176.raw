1) Felix: Homeworld R1 B3 G3
	alexhouston: hi


2) alexhouston: Homeworld G3 R2 B3
	Felix: Hello! First game?

3) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	alexhouston: Yeah first game on SDG, I recently got Pyramid Arcade and Homeworlds was easily my favorite on there.  I'll admit I'm still probably a pretty novice player so you might not find me a huge challenge but I'm just trying to get better

	Felix: No problem! The best way to get better is to practice and play a lot. I'm no pro but I have played quite a few games on here so I hope I'm able to help you improve. Let me know if you have any questions and if I think of any tips I'll let you know!

4) alexhouston: Build B1 Alexhouston
	Felix: I have found that starting with a green star in your homeworld generally makes the game a bit more difficult for a newer player The reason is that it makes it harder to set up a "factory" in your homeworld (A g3 and another green) without overcrowding it with green. Of course, you can always try and build that factory elsewhere, but it's a bit more difficult usually. It's also widely considered strongest to begin with a large green ship because this provides extra build power in the early game (It's possible to sacrifice the G3 to build 3 ships, one of which could be a large). That extra build potential can realy help build up one's fleet early on, and it's not always so easy to do that if you start with something like a B3 (though a b3 does give you an early edge in getting blue ships, which is good too)

5) Felix: Trade G1 Y1 Felix

6) alexhouston: Trade B1 Y1 Alexhouston

7) Felix: Build G1 Felix

8) alexhouston: Discover Y1 Alexhouston G1 Star

9) Felix: Trade G1 B1 Felix
	Felix: Just as a general tip, it is sometimes wiser to build another ship of a particular color before you move your ship out. For instance, since you just moved your y1 to a new system, you lost the ability to use yellow in your homeworld, and to get it back you'll either have to move your y1 back there or build a b1 and then trade it for a y1, which will essentially cause you to waste a turn in the future. If you built another y1 first and THEN moved one of them out, then you'd retain the yellow ability in both systems. It's a good rule of thumb to build first and then move, but then again, there might be unique situations where you won't ALWAYS want to follow that rule.

10) alexhouston: Build B1 Alexhouston

	alexhouston: Thanks for the tips, that definitely makes sense.

	Draw5PlayAll: Building the Y1 would allow Felix to get a Y2.

	Laurie_Menke: Hi Felix... I just wanted to let you and alexhouston know that I'm making a list of games to ask Aaron to end due to abandonment.  I know you are both currently active on SDG right now, but this game seems abandoned, so I am going to include it on the list unless one of you says not to in the next 24 hours.  I hope that's the right thing to do.  :)
	Laurie_Menke: Ooops!  I'm sorry!  I see now that the game is back on track.  I won't have Aaron delete it.  Sorry for the interruption!
	Felix: @Laurie_Menke Thanks for letting us know. It does seem that it was abandoned after all, so I went ahead and ended it!
	Draw5PlayAll: Evidently the deletion happened, as there are only 165 games in progress.
	Laurie_Menke: You're welcome, Felix!  And yes, it has happened, Draw5PlayAll.  Hopefully we can play with real people who are really here now instead of ghost people on ladders and long lists of timed out games.  :)
