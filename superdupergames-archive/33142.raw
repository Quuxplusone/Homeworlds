Fundamentally, the game is all about making sure you have what you need to win, while denying it to your opponent, by manipulating not only your own pieces but the supply.  
 
This was why my move on turn 10 (click on history to see a listing style of the game) was very good, and fundamentally won the game; I gave up my large, but I reduced you to smalls without a strong prospect if getting anything larger, with me still keeping a strong red growth engine, so I could build an overpowering attack before you could recover.  
 
As it was, you could have delayed me for another two turns by growing ships -- once I started capturing, you could delay me by just capturing smalls back, so I needed enough red power that I could continuously capture until the game ended.  If you'd grown a ship, I'd have grown a medium red -- that would have given me a combined 7 attack, which -still- wasn't enough to capture 6 ships; I sac large red to take 3, you capture one back and have 4, I sac a medium red and take 2, you capture one back and have 3, I sac a medium red and have 2, and you capture one back and have 2 and I'm out of artillery.  So I'd have gone one -more- round of prep and grown another large red before going off; at that point even if you went to 7 ships (7 was basically your limit, too, since your home could only hold 3 greens, 2 blues, and 3 yellows--and since you can't capture back a medium if I take your only one, the 3rd green was a non-starter), I could take them all; 1 3 red to drop you from 7 to 4 (which could go to 5), another 3 red to go from 5 to 2, and the two red ships could take out the remaining 3 ships even if you grew or captured every turn.
