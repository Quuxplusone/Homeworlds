Homeworlds Online (SDG# 35453)
Started: 2019.8.14, Ended: 2019.9.12
Participants: kataclysm (S), Felix (N)
Winner: Felix

1) Felix: Homeworld R1 B3 G3
	kataclysm: Can you read what I've typed here? Is this the box for communicating between players?
	Felix: Yep! You've got it. And you enter your commands for the game up top. This game is for the Homeworlds tournament! Good luck and have fun :)

2) kataclysm: Homeworld B2 G1 R3

3) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	kataclysm: Yes, for Homeworlds tournament. I have only played Homeworlds 3 times, but I really liked it. You will almost certainly end up winning! I'm just in this to have a good time and get practice. :)
	Felix: That's the best way to learn! I still lose a lot, but I lost probably my first 30 or so games on here, but it's always a win if you have fun and learn something and get a bit better every time. So have fun!

4) kataclysm: Build R1 Kataclysm

5) Felix: Trade G1 Y1 Felix

6) kataclysm: Trade R1 Y1 Kataclysm

9) Felix: B G1 Felix

10) kataclysm: Trade Y1 R1 Kataclysm
	Felix: One word of advice is to try and diversify the colors you have available. Trading all your red away for yellow leaves you with no red. Always better to build another red before you trade, so that you always have a red somewhere and don't lose that color. Make sense?

11) Felix: D G1 Felix B2 Rim
	kataclysm: I'm sure it will make more sense as I go along :)

19) Felix: Discover G2 Rim B3 Rom

20) kataclysm: Move R2 Kataclysm Rom
	kataclysm: I tried to fly my red medium ship to Rom by saying "move r2 Rom" and the game won't let me, saying "The system does not exist."
	Felix: You have to specify the system you're moving it from first. So "move r2 kataclysm rom". You can also shorten most commands to just the first letter. So you can say m r2 etc instead of move r2
