	mneme: You're welcome--as much for my benefit as yours!  huh--I didn't even realize I'd started it as a small universe game!

6) mneme: Build B1 Mneme
	Laurie_Menke: Oh! I thought that was on purpose!  :)  Just FYI... I will be on the road again from tomorrow (Thursday) through Sunday or possibly Monday.  I definitely won't time out again, but may play slowly while I'm traveling. Sorry...
	mneme: I was experimenting with SU right before the tournament, but yeah, I just went with large/small because I kinda hate goldilocs starts and didn't want to give you a great headsteart, not really thinking about the fact that I was setting up SU as as a result.


7) Laurie_Menke: Build G1 Laurie_menke
	Laurie_Menke: Makes sense!

8) mneme: Trade B3 Y3 Mneme

9) Laurie_Menke: Build R1 Laurie_menke
	mneme: And yeah; playing slowly is fine; I mostly don't think about games when I'm not either making a move or reviewing the move I just made, so it doesn't bother me when the timing slows down.
	Laurie_Menke: Thank you! I should be good now for a while. I don't leave again until the 14th, and that's on vacation not business, so I'll still have time to play.  :)

19) Laurie_Menke: Move G1 Caliope Mneme

	mneme: Ack.  I don't know why I don't get reliable game updates, but its cost me games.  move was obv a g1 mneme
	Laurie_Menke: Alas... OK... Babamots... I think we just need to stick with the original results and say mneme won. We both know they're the better player and would have won eventually. Thank you both for giving this a second shot! Happy New Year!  :)
	mneme: Ug.  I'd be willing to give it a third try if you're game (prolly wouldn't take more than a day to set it up); that feels a lot less dirty than just calling the game for me despite my own timeout.  If I can also start a wil game, that should make it easier to maintain time.
	Laurie_Menke: I will leave that up to you and Babamots, but I really don't mind just saying we both know you would have won.
	Babamots: Would you guys like to play again with "soft" timers? I only put "hard time" in the tournament rules because I knew there would be flakey people. They forget that they were ever in a tournament, the game never ends, and the game list gets cluttered. I trust you two to not wander off.
	Laurie_Menke: I'm willing if you are, mneme! Thanks, Babamots!  :)
	Laurie_Menke: Hi Babamots (and mneme), I'm sorry to do this, but I'm just going to withdraw from the Homeworlds Tournament. I'm in last place anyway and I'm just not able to keep up with my travel schedule. Sorry for the problems I've caused. I'll email you this info as well, Babamots.  Thanks for all the fun, everyone!  :)
