Participants: bhorner (S), Felix (N)
Winner: Felix

1) Felix: Homeworld B1 R3 G3
	bhorner: If you miss your opportunity to move, we can just start another game.  :)
	Felix: We can keep going with this one, but would there be a good time this week to knock out a large number of moves? I am in GMT-5 time (Eastern time in the United States) and my schedule is pretty flexible.

2) bhorner: Homeworld B2 R1 G3

3) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	bhorner: I think that rushing things would significantly affect my chances.  :)
	bhorner: (I'm in Pacific time U.S. which is GMT-8)

4) bhorner: B G1 Bhorner
	Felix: Well, I'm okay with drawing it out, but the instructions for the bracket games said to try to finish them within one week...
	Draw5PlayAll: One WEEK?!
	bhorner: The time controls didn't change did they?  I never saw the part about finishing w/in a week.

5) Felix: Trade G1 B1 Felix
	bhorner: I think you must be referring to the "Remaining Active" section.  It doesn't say you must complete a game in 7 days, just that you remain active, and the first way to remain active is:
"You will be considered active for the following seven days if
you are currently in at least one game that is part of the tournament"
That let's the time controls kick in.
I'm not trying to draw it out, not trying to bore you into a mistake.  I just like the game, and want to think hard, and take a couple looks at the next move before I go.  That's the thing about correspondence board games, they're probably higher quality due to the extended time per move.  Good luck to you!

	Felix: You're right. I think I just misread the rules for the bracket portion of the tournament. I have no problem drawing it out and didn't mean to rush you! :) Good luck.
