	dlwillson: From last game: The "gun" rule: When the other "goes for his gun", go for yours. When he gets a red ship, you get one, too.
	dlwillson: Also from last game: Each ship is worth roughly the number of it's pips, plus one for each step toward the opponent. So, a big in his orbit is worth 5, approximately.
	dlwillson: Also, also from last game: If the opponent will have two or more turns to recover from the kicking you're about to give him before you can give him another kicking, don't overspend on this kicking.

17) dlwillson: Build Y3 Field
	wil: yiikes

	dlwillson: I know, right. The last few moves have been bad for you, and I don't see an easy way for you to have gotten out of it. At least now the pressure's off for one move. Maybe two...
	wil: oh crap it is all over....   so where did it all go wrong...  I almost switched out before the Y3s so to put a Y1 in the way
	wil: embarrassing loss....wow
	dlwillson: That'll be another good one to replay. You let me run the bank in my favor.
Incidentally, I didn't see the end coming. Did you resign over the material advantage I had?
	wil: I had no green, could not do anything anywhere....couldn't change back, you move in with your red and it is over..
	dlwillson: You could've moved your Y3 from argh to wil and turned it green, I think. It would've cost you two turns, and I probably might've been able to build the y3 away from you, so it wasn't going well. Feel free to start another, if you like. If you're learning, but you don't feel like you're going to get a win, feel free to start an un-rated game.
	wil: heck I don't care what my ratings look like...i really appreciate the game and the lessons....it looked like I was gonna be a step behind and my mistakes would be more likely than yours...   I don't feel right running in circles wasting time of better players...
