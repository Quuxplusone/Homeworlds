Participants: Steele (S), Felix (N)
Winner: Felix

1) Felix: Homeworld B3 Y2 G3

2) Steele: Homeworld G3 Y1 B3
	Felix: Welcome! First game? Have fun!

3) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	Steele: Yeah, first game of homeworlds ever, but it looks like a cool game.  It looks like I game I will quickly fall in love with.
	Felix: I'm sure you will! I fell in love with it myself last year and it is my favorite game of all time now. I hope you have fun. Let me know if you have any questions and I'd be happy to help you learn the ropes.
	Felix: But the best way to learn is to make mistakes, so I won't take it TOO easy on you :) Some of the other players on here are brutal! I'll try to give you tips along the way if I think of them.

4) Steele: B B1 Steele
	Felix: One quick tip to start with: you don't have to type out the full word of the commands. You can just type "b b1 steele" instead of "build b1 Steele". Saves a bit of time!

5) Felix: T G1 B1 Felix
	Steele: Good to know!  Also good to know it won't let me make invalid moves (because the first two attempts weren't valid).  :)
	Felix: Yeah! The system will only let you make valid moves, which is a great way to learn the rules

12) Steele: Discover G1 Steele B2 Alpha

13) Felix: Discover B1 Felix G1 Orpheus

14) Steele: B Y2 Steele

15) Felix: Build Y2 Felix
	Felix: I recommend trying to get a blue ship in your home system. It can cause a real color clog if you don't, since you can't trade any of your colors for others. It may have been a mistake to trade your B3 ship away at the beginning without building another blue first. If you had built a small blue and THEN traded your large blue away, you would still have the capacity to build blue and to trade in your homeworld, but now you have a difficult situation in your home system...

16) Steele: Build G1 Alpha
	Steele: Yeah, I noticed that as soon as I did it.  Now I'm trying to use the blue star to fix it :)

17) Felix: Move Y1 Felix Orpheus

18) Steele: Build G2 Alpha

19) Felix: Build Y3 Orpheus
	Felix: Yeah. It's going to cost you a few turns to fix things, though, and momentum is crucial at this point in the game!

	Felix: Now you're in better shape. Nice use of the factory!

30) Steele: Discover Y2 Steele R2 Beta
	Steele: Thanks, I wasn't sure if I was doing that right - but I like the effect.  Now to get myself out of this yellow catastrophe threat you have me in...

31) Felix: B B3 Orpheus

32) Steele: Discover Y2 Beta R1 Gamma
	Felix: Good catch. And watch out with all that green you've got at home too...
	Steele: Yep, not sure green was a good homeworld choice...

33) Felix: Sacrifice Y3 Orpheus

34) Steele: Sacrifice Y3 Alpha
Move Y1 Alpha Gamma
Move Y1 Gamma Felix
Move Y2 Gamma Felix
Catastrophe Felix Yellow
	Felix: Putting green in your Homeworld can definitely make things more difficult. The main problem is that it makes it hard to set up a factory there. Of course, it's always possible to try to set up a factory in another system instead. If you can accomplish that, it can actually be a good homeworld color to have because it forces your opponent to potentially use green as an invasion color, and it's usually a tricky color to invade with.
	Felix: On the whole, I think the most effective starting homeworld is blue and yellow with a large green ship. This comes down to preference, though. I know a player who always starts with blue and red, with a green ship, and he wins often. As a beginner, it will also help you to start with the "banker" homeworld (a small and medium star).

35) Felix: Sacrifice Y3 Mikal
Move B1 Mikal Steele
Move B1 Felix Steele
Pass
Catastrophe Steele Blue
	Felix: Now things might be a bit tricky for you :/ But not impossible to recover from!

	Steele: I was wondering if you could double move the same ship or not.  Looks like you can - so I gave it a go too ;)
	Felix: Absolutely. You can even triple move a ship. Nice move! But it has also left you vulnerable to my own counterattack!
	Felix: Nicely played! I hope you learned some things. I have an open challenge on the challenges list so feel free to challenge me again and we'll have a rematch :)
	Felix: It can be really satisfying to destroy half of your opponent's homeworld, as you did to mine, but you also need to have a plan in place for finishing the job, or you may leave yourself vulnerable.
	Steele: Learned a ton and I will definitely be starting a rematch soon!
