	jrandom: Well, you've got me addicted now.
	wil: Cool.  So you've started with Fortress...you get out of your homeworld with one pip pawns...they disappear early so a long game makes it harder for the other side to get in... Folks believe the best start is banker, because my moving out greens you can sacrifice the investment later and build a queen star...  I am taking goldilocks...because it isn't right for me to take that start...

	wil: a.  I like the speed of your play...makes me gotta watch so I don't delay you (I've had some games take months as people are so slow to respond)  b.  I am making a 'b' line to corner a commodity  (it is always what I attempt...if I can't do it I simply switch to building and trying to be the first in larger pyramids in any situation.  c.  is this your first pyramid game?  do you own and physical Looney Pyramids?

11) jrandom: Discover G1 Jrandom G1 Connery
	wil: one of the problems with having a green in your homestar is the fact that you cannot create a factory at home...always at risk of catastrophe
	jrandom: I've actually ordered a pile of Looney Pyramids.  This is my second game of Homeworlds.

31) jrandom: Pass
	wil: the power of the factory cannot be overlooked... once the Gs are out...a G3 and any other G is a factory...sacrifice the G3 rebuild it right back where it was, and then build two more ships wherever you can..
	wil: risky in that I've got 3 Ys and two of them Queens...but they are two star systems away..so you have to sack a y2 to hop a y1 one in to catastrophe...leaving you with only one y...and I have the ability (thru B monopoly and factory) to grow faster.
