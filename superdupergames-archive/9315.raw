9) scottobear: Build Y1 Scottobear
zoltar: I usually use red/blue homeworlds, because I don't have to worry about not having a red ship and having my homeworld invaded -- it always has defense abilities to capture an invader -- and I can build more greens and yellows without worrying as much about catastrophes, so if I build a 'factory' (when all the greens are used and I have a G3 and another green ship in my homeworld and can sacrifice the green and immediately rebuild it and get two more grow turns at once) a single green ship won't be able to blow up my factory.
scottobear: sounds like a good strategy! i'm still developing mine..I'm new!

zoltar: Time to send in a jihadist!

27) scottobear: Discover R1 Scottobear B1 Monkey
zoltar: Building the Y3 in your homeworld would have been much better, as I would have to sac my Y3 in my homeworld to send my y1 into your homeworld to blow up the yellow ships, and then forces would remain equal. In this case, however, I got to sacrifice only my y2 to take out your Y3 and blow up the entire system, leaving me with two large ships to your one after the simplification.
zoltar: And you're welcome -- I love discussing this game, as it's the most interesting new game I've discovered in years -- and I live just down the street from the designer/author of the game.

scottobear: am I missing something, it says I'm out of actions.

43) scottobear: Trade B2 R2 Scottobear
zoltar: Yes, you can't both move and attack in one round. If you sac a Y2, you get two movements. If you sac an R2, you get two attacks. But you can't sac a Y2 (nor an R2) and get one movement and one attack. So you can't both move your R3 and then attack my Y3 in the same turn.

zoltar: Obviously you don't want to simply move your R3, as I can now capture it. So click on undo and find another move, but be careful, as the software only lets you undo your move once per turn.
scottobear: thanks!

zoltar: Hey, I invited you to my Zendo game, because one of the players never showed up yet, and I saw that you've signed up for a couple of Zendo games. Zendo and Homeworlds are now my two favorites.

zoltar: Btw, I live in Greenbelt, close to the Looneys as well, and down the street from John Cooper (aka Gort here), the author of Homeworlds.
scottobear: Very keen... I'm in north beach - I go to work in greenbelt every weekday!

#Catastrophe Scottobear R

zoltar: Though actually, this move is cuter, as it puts you in what chessplayers call "Zugzwang", which means that every possible move spells doom for you.
scottobear: that's no moon!!
