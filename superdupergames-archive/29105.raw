	wil: This system is too pollutes from uae of fossil fuels and refi ing waste from petroleum products... We are moving on to a clean one rather than take care of our own..you may have it...it is now a superfund site
	Felix: I suppose I will just stay and clean up this mess. Another controlled burn ought to do it. It's unfortunate you were unable to evacuate your small construction vessel, but the loss will benefit the greater good of the galaxy's stability.
	Felix: Frankly I'm surprised my risk paid off. I thought I was done for!
	wil: This is where I wish we could backup.to move x and retry various endings...gg
	wil: Good job cleaning up the mess.,.now the debris is propelling itself through the galaxy
