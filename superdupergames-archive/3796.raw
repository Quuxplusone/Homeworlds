27) zoltar: Discover Y2 Zoltar B3 Blueridge
zoltar: Well, I lost three or four moves: you have an extra 2-pip ship, you have two more ships moved out of your homeworld than I, and it's your move -- I've still yet to do that well in the openings -- I thought my sack would put me up, but it seems to have cost me a couple of moves instead.
zoltar: I'm doing very well in my games, in fact, except in the opening -- where I often tend to end up playing catch up.
zoltar: I'll have caught up if I can grab that huge yellow ship before you do.

65) zoltar: Move Y1 Greenbelt Moon
jeep: ?? That seems quite rude. I printed out the game and was looking at it throughout the day and now I come in to find that you undid a day after you made the move? Nice.
jeep: FWIW, my opinion is that undo is fine if it happens relatively soon... but it shouldn't take a day to undo your move.
zoltar: Sorry, I guess you're right -- I didn't realize you were looking at it, and figured you were out of town, and then thought, hey, that looks cooler. Sorry about that. I'd undo it and do the other move now, but it won't let me do it again.
jeep: Apology accepted. I wasted quite a bit of time yesterday, though. I often print out my homeworlds games in the morning and check in on it when I have time. I then try to make my moves after work.
jeep: Well, I suppose it doesn't really matter since I now have no shot because of the missed catastrophe (which I still think I typed in).

66) jeep: Trade Y2 G2 Jeep

67) zoltar: Trade R3 G3 Moon
zoltar: That sucks about the catastrophe -- it's too bad there isn't an option to undo several moves and go on from there. Though it's cool you actually print out the games -- I didn't realize anyone was so dedicated! That's great.
