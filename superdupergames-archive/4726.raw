Homeworlds Online (SDG# 4726)
Started: 2006.12.7, Ended: 2007.1.11
Participants: Lexicon (S), DavidF (W), tcerier (N), Uglyfoot (E)
Winner: Uglyfoot

1) Uglyfoot: Homeworld B3 Y1 G3
	DavidF: Hello All - I've played Homeworlds a number of times in the materail world, but never in Cyberspace before, so please be frogiving in my awkwardness with some of the movement of pieces. Also, in the material game a key element to the fun is the desgination of players being either "good" or "evil". I'm not seeing anything like that here. Am I missing something?
 

	Lexicon: Wow, I didn't even notice this game had started.  Wonder where tcerier is.  Anyway, DavidF, this variant is Last Man Standing, so you have to kill everyone else.  There is also the sinister variant, where you have to kill the player to your left.
	Lexicon: Anyway, tcerier isn't around anymore, so I'm just going to resign him.

2) Lexicon: Homeworld B2 Y3 G3

3) DavidF: Homeworld G3 B1 Y3

4) Uglyfoot: Build G1 Uglyfoot
	DavidF: Can someone give me lesson on how to submit orders? I can't seem to find any better reference than what's on this page. I've tried a number of variations but keep getting "nothing left in stash" messages. Here's what i most recently typed: Homeworld (G3, B1, Y3)
	Lexicon: no parentheses or commas.  every command on a separate line.  so your first command would be
homeworld g3 b1 y3
	Lexicon: And actually, you just have to type the first letter of each command, so "h g3 b1 y3" would work.  A lot of stuff about homeworlds here is discussed in its wiki, which is linked at the top of the page.  

5) Lexicon: Build G1 Lexicon
	DavidF: Thanx

6) DavidF: Build Y1 Davidf

7) Uglyfoot: Discover G1 Uglyfoot B2 Welcomemat

8) Lexicon: Trade G1 R1 Lexicon

9) DavidF: Discover Y1 Davidf G2 Yorn

10) Uglyfoot: Build G1 Uglyfoot
	DavidF: So how do i create a new systme called Yorn? I've tried different perambulations of  "discover y1 DavidF g1 yorn" and i keep being refused? Help?
	Lexicon: You can't move to a size 1 system, only a size 2.  So try "d y1 DavidF g1 yorn"
	Lexicon: ack.  I mean, 'd y1 DavidF g2 yorn"
	DavidF: I tried that. I geta "these systmes aren't connected message." I'm confused; I'm trying to create a new system.
	Lexicon: Hm.  if "discover y1 DavidF g2 yorn" doesn't work, I don't know what to tell you.  Your system is definitely connected to a g2, but not a g1.

11) Lexicon: Build G1 Lexicon
	DavidF: thanx again, Lexicon. i think i'm beginning to understand, although i've never played this way. i've always played with the direct capacity to send a ship and create whatever size system, without taking into consideration the size i'm sending from. an interesting difference in rules. 
	Lexicon: If the last time you played was with the older version rules, then you have a lot to learn.  I did the same thing; it was quite confusing for a while.

12) DavidF: Build Y1 Davidf

13) Uglyfoot: Trade G1 R1 Uglyfoot

14) Lexicon: Discover G1 Lexicon Y1 Hydrogen
	DavidF: UglyFoot and Lexicon - i'll be out of town 5-6 days and at house with no computer. There's a chance i can get to mysister's computer but not definite. Might be a slow go as well until i'm back.
	Uglyfoot: no problem.  I'm on vacation but with ready access to computers.  I'm a member of a really geeky family...   :>

15) DavidF: Trade Y3 R3 Davidf
	Lexicon: My family's geekiness did not extend all the way to grandma's house. Sorry to be late myself. :)

36) DavidF: Attack Y1E Davidf
	DavidF: Lexicon, I probably should have asked for a rules clarification before my last move, but i was needing to get some stuff done around here, work, etc. So, does a little red ship in Uglyfoot's system enable Uglyfoot to attack my R3 with his Y3? If so, that would be a good move on his/her part and not good news for you either. If so, sorry and good luck
	Lexicon: That is correct.  He will own your R3.  Feel free to undo your move and try something else, as far as I'm concerned.
	Uglyfoot: DavidF, Please go ahead and undo that.  We can continue from there...
	DavidF: UglyFoot, that's very generous of you. It would make the game more interesting, particularly for me, but it's a moot point now, it seems. I have lost the 'undo' move function. I tried to call an administrator, to have it reinstated but the operator has timed out. Uglyfoot and lexicon, i suggest we go ahead, and i'll chalk this up as an aflo (another frigging learning opportunity).  
	DavidF: Okay, I clearly don't know what I'm doing.An administrator e-mailed back, and so I'll send this out, with another Administrator call. 
	DavidF: Administrator - we are all agreed, Lexicon, Uglyfoot and myself, for me, DavidF, to undo my last move. Could you reinstate my "Undo Last Move" button?
	DavidF: Thanks for the offer, Uglyfoot. I cannot connect with the administator. If someone else is willing and wanting me to undo my last move, please feel free to contact the Adminsitrator. I'm okay with proceeding. 

37) Uglyfoot: Sacrifice R3 Uglyfoot
Attack R1W Davidf
Attack Y1W Davidf
Attack Y1W Davidf

38) Lexicon: Build G1 Hydrogen
	DavidF: Do either of you know a better command for attacking the y1 ship in my system. a y1 DavidF doesn't work and i suspect the presence of two y1 ships in the sytem is complicating things.
	Lexicon: read the little text below the command list.  a y1e davidf
