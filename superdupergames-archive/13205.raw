Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2009.4.1, Ended: 2009.4.8
Participants: TwoShort (S), jeep (N)
Winner: TwoShort

1) jeep: Homeworld R1 B2 G3

2) TwoShort: Homeworld R1 B3 G3
	jeep: pass first build
	jeep: Heh, that was supposed to be a note.  I think that your flip to red strategy can be worse.   You can actually take a R3 ship, grow, then flip the large on turn 2.  Not sure it is any different than your way, but it sure feels worse to be locked out first turn.
	TwoShort: I need green and blue, so if I take the red ship, I have need to grow twice to get both 1s, so it's the same.

3) jeep: Pass
	TwoShort: For maximum pain, I probably should have made a small universe...

4) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

5) jeep: Build G1 Jeep

6) TwoShort: Trade G1 R1 Twoshort
	jeep: Wow, we have a lot of spectators.

7) jeep: Trade G1 Y1 Jeep
	TwoShort: Oh, that's just my adoring fans; they follow me everywhere :)  Actually, I don't think any of them are there.  Once you start "watching" a player, it takes an actual action to stop, so if they don't come back to the site, their ghost haunts me forever.  Notably, only a couple of the names do I even vaguely remember as someone I might have played once.  Also I periodically say "Hey, spectators, if you're really there PM me!" and they never do.

8) TwoShort: Build R2 Twoshort

9) jeep: Build G1 Jeep
	jeep: Wow... I don't even know how I'm going to deal with this.  ;)

10) TwoShort: Trade R2 Y2 Twoshort
	jeep: I'm now a man with a plan.

11) jeep: Trade G3 R3 Jeep
	jeep: Yeah, small universe would be tough here.

12) TwoShort: Discover R1 Twoshort G2 Noescape
	TwoShort: So this will get you out if I don't do something extreme, but knowing I was going to play this way, would you still play Banker, or would you go to fortress to avoid it?
	jeep: Fortress is better in this case.
	TwoShort: Well in any case, time to try something extreme :)


13) jeep: Build G1 Jeep
	jeep: How is that extreme?  Pretty rough on me, though.  Have to think a little more than the 5 min while compiling.

14) TwoShort: Build R2 Noescape

15) jeep: Discover G1 Jeep R3 Onlyhope
	TwoShort:  I was thinking the straight forward thing for me to do there was to build the r2 before moving out which would let you build an r2 and break the monopoly, and we'd emerge from the early game with me at a clear advantage, but the game still in play.  This is the first step of a more extreme plan, which if it doesn't work, I'll be in a tough spot.  But I think now it will work, and you'll be inescapably doomed :) 
	jeep: Yep, the switch to red was bad.
