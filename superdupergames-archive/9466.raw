	stoneaxe: Hi There.  I see you are the current highest ranking Homeworlds expert.  I'm a newbie, so feel free to impart some galactic wisdom!  Just getting into this game... there is a lot of strategy to it!!!

6) TwoShort: Trade G1 Y1 Twoshort

7) stoneaxe: Build G1 Stoneaxe
	TwoShort: Hmmm, there is definitely a lot of strategy to it; as far as galactic wisdom:  In the early game, don't get locked out of a color and don't let me get more 3 pointers than you.

8) TwoShort: Build Y2 Twoshort

9) stoneaxe: Build Y2 Stoneaxe

10) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort
	stoneaxe: I need to learn better when to sacrifice ships to do something else.
	TwoShort: Sacrifices are somewhat rare;  you might sacrifice a 1 or 2 if you need to use that color in different system and it's just worth the cost.  If you sacrifice a g3, you generally want to be growing a new 3 pointer as part of the action; the most common sacrifice is a g3 that lets you regrow the very same g3 (plus two other things)- we call that the factory.  Sacrificing a yellow 3 should mean you're going for the kill.

11) stoneaxe: Trade Y2 B2 Stoneaxe

12) TwoShort: Discover Y1 Twoshort G3 Grogar

13) stoneaxe: Build B1 Stoneaxe

14) TwoShort: Discover G1 Twoshort Y3 Yolonda

15) stoneaxe: Discover G1 Stoneaxe G2 Bespin

16) TwoShort: Build Y2 Grogar
	TwoShort: As long as I'm throwing around advice, that's a bit of an odd move; you won't really be able to do much with that ship or star in the future.  I do essentially that move from similar position, but the point is to suck up the g2 in order to affect who gets a chance to grow 3 point greens, and that doesn't currently apply.  It might have been better to move to a different color, so you'd have more options, or to move out a y or b, neither of which can grow further in your homeworld without danger.

17) stoneaxe: Move B1 Stoneaxe Bespin
	stoneaxe: I see.  Thank you!  Keep the advice coming!  

18) TwoShort: Discover Y2 Grogar B2 Bluestar

19) stoneaxe: Build Y2 Stoneaxe
	stoneaxe: I feel like if I MOVE pieces, then i'm not building pieces, so I'm probly falling behind.  Well, I should've planned it better.  

20) TwoShort: Sacrifice G3 Twoshort
Build Y3 Bluestar
Build Y3 Twoshort
Build G1 Yolonda
	TwoShort: I know the feeling, but I think the key realization for the early game is that it doesn't really matter too much if you fall behind in 1s & 2s, the key is the timing on building the 3 points.  So you want to have a safe place to build any color that's getting close, and to set up your opponent to build the last 2.  Alternatively, you can set up several places to safely build a particular color, so that you can sacrifice a g3 to build the last 2 pointer of that color yourself and immediately plow into building the 3s.

21) stoneaxe: Move Y2 Stoneaxe Bluestar
	TwoShort: Hmm, I'm not sure if you realize that lets me move my y2 in from BlueStar to blow up half your homeworld, or if you just don't se a better option (which there may not be)   In any case, you'll get away with it for a turn at least, because I think the grow more firmly ensures my victory :)

22) TwoShort: Trade Y3 R3 Bluestar
	stoneaxe: I did not realize that, but I see how now... you would've moved in and caused catastrophe on yellow.

23) stoneaxe: Trade B2 R2 Stoneaxe
	stoneaxe: Its probably dumb, but I will threaten to do the same thing in BlueStar.  Should I have done something else?  You will probably sac and still catastrophe Y in my homeworld, right?
	TwoShort: You didn't have great options, because I'm winning :)  You might have moved the y2 out to a new star, but I'm saying that knowing what I'm going to do this turn. It's easy to think an extra move ahead if you wait a turn to do it :)  I could still blow up half your homeworld, but it would be expensive, and I have no immediate threat vs the other half.  By flipping my y3 to red, you must spend next turn turning something red or lose, so I can take your y2 the turn after that, then you still won't be able to safely grow the y3, so I'll probably get that back too.

24) TwoShort: Attack Y2N Bluestar

	stoneaxe: I sense my destruction is near!  (didn't see any way out)  Good game!  I feel like I learned a lot in this game.  Also read some of your Archive games.  Thanks for all the tips.  Can you play another?
	TwoShort: Thanks for the game!
	TwoShort: I'll be happy to play another...
