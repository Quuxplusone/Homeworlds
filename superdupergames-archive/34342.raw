	mneme: mate in 2.  Well played.
	Babamots: Am I right that this was a tournament game? It looks like it was reported at the end but not at the beginning.
	Trydnt: Yes you are correct. Neither of us put it in at the beginning but should be in there now
	Babamots: Thanks!
	Babamots: Wait, I just noticed that, at the beginning of the game, mneme said in the comments that this is NOT a tournament game. I'm going to delete it from the record unless mneme wants to count it.
	Trydnt: That is true. Mneme did we have another game running that was a tourney game?
	mneme: Huh.  I'm not sure.  It was playing it as if it were a tournamnent game, but it clearly wasn't -- the setup didn't match the tournament approach, which was why I put that note in the beginning.
 
Almost a shame, since I think we were both playing it with intent, but that just makes it good practice.
