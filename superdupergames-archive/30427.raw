Homeworlds Online (SDG# 30427)
Started: 2016.12.18, Ended: 2017.1.28
Participants: Babamots (S), Draw5PlayAll (W), Felix (N), mi_spero (E)
Winner: Babamots

1) Felix: Homeworld R2 B3 G3
	mi_spero: Good luck and have fun! 
	mi_spero: Hi, Draw5. :) Can teammates coordinate via pm?
	Draw5PlayAll: Hold on.
	Draw5PlayAll: (Apparently the times were rounded.)
 
Ok, so this is an unofficial team mode, So it is Felix & MiSpero vs Babamots and me.
 
Yes, PM communication is legal. However, we have a more pressing issue: Babamots has not signed in for the last seven weeks. I have a trick to try to spur action, but I do not know if it will work. If this fails, we can scrap this game and try to find a more active player.
	mi_spero: @Draw5PlayAll feel free to invite me if we're remaking.
	Draw5PlayAll: The call admin thing was designed to just do that, but nowadays Aaron is busy and we use it to send emails to all players in the game.
	Draw5PlayAll: Oh, and make sure we actually give Babamots a chance.
	mi_spero: Ok. And nice exploit with the call admin! It's always fun to figure out ways to use things in ways they weren't originally intended. :D
	Babamots: I'm not a great player, but I don't think I'll totally bore you either. I will have less time to play while I'm traveling for the holidays, but I won't time out.
	Babamots: I'm not a great player, but I don't think I'll totally bore you either. I will have less time to play while I'm traveling for the holidays, but I won't time out.
	Babamots: I'm not a great player, but I don't think I'll totally bore you either. I will have less time to play while I'm traveling for the holidays, but I won't time out.
	Babamots: I'm not a great player, but I don't think I'll totally bore you either. I will have less time to play while I'm traveling for the holidays, but I won't time out.
	Babamots: Thanks for letting me stay :-).
	Felix: Cool! Have fun all! MiSpero, feel free to message me so we can coordinate our plan of attack!

2) mi_spero: Homeworld B2 Y1 G3
	mi_spero: @Felix, I think I'm with Draw5.
	Draw5PlayAll: I originally intended opposite sides to be teammates, so yes, MiSpero is with Felix.
	Draw5PlayAll: Belay that! I was looking at the clocks, not the positions. Yes, MiSpero *is* on my team.
	mi_spero: Ok; that makes sense. :D That would be how I would intuitively interpret it too.
	mi_spero: So its me and Felix vs Draw and Babamots. Gl hf!

3) Babamots: Homeworld G3 Y1 B3
	Draw5PlayAll: No, Felix and Babamots are on a team. Felix is north and Babamots is south.
 
I got confused by the clocks.
	mi_spero: Oh, ok.
	mi_spero: Well, now that's sorted out. :D

4) Draw5PlayAll: Homeworld R1 B2 G3

5) Felix: Build G1 Felix

6) mi_spero: Build G1 Mi_spero
	Felix: Good luck!

7) Babamots: Build B1 Babamots

8) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: I wish I knew if Felix and Babamots were planning anything through secret messages...

9) Felix: Trade G1 Y1 Felix
	mi_spero: :D
	mi_spero: Well, I think it would be GTO to do so, therefore if we act as if they are and play in a maximally exploitative way, which will also be GTO, they can therefore not gain any advantage by deviating from the GTO which we assumed they were enacting. :D So we don't need to know. :D

10) mi_spero: Discover G1 Mi_spero Y3 Tarci

11) Babamots: Build B1 Babamots
	mi_spero: "tarci" ['tar-she] means: "x1 is a star/sun with stellar properties x2." in lojban.
	mi_spero: so "ta tarci lo pelxu" would mean "That star/sun has stellar property 'yellow'" or "That star is yellow".
	mi_spero: I think. lojban grammar is hard.

12) Draw5PlayAll: Trade G1 Y1 Draw5playall

13) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: vIH ma'eH!
	Babamots: Iä! Iä!

	mi_spero: @Babamots Is that Na'vi?
	Babamots: That's the cheer of Cthulhu's worshippers.

14) mi_spero: Build G1 Mi_spero
	Felix: I sprek engrish.
	Draw5PlayAll: We all seem to be speaking different languages. Literally.
	Draw5PlayAll: 
	Draw5PlayAll: Well,  more like writing or typing.
	mi_spero: go'i (literally repeats the last statement in the conversation)
	mi_spero: And pronounced "'Go-he". (It's lojban)

	mi_spero: what?

	Draw5PlayAll: Is that the Ferengi from Star Trek TNG?

21) Felix: B B1 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: ...keep forgetting I have a 1-2 when I have a 1-3 in every other active game (except one 2-3).
	Babamots: Ferenginar is in fact the Ferengi homeworld. It rains almost everywhere almost all the time.

22) mi_spero: Trade G1 B1 Mi_spero
	Babamots: Happy holiday(s) everyone! Travel safe if that's what you're up to!

39) Babamots: Build B1 Ferenginar
	mi_spero: lookup bandu on vlasisku if you're curious about the name.
	mi_spero: I wanted to say "bandu zo'e la fileks", but there wasn't enough room.
	Draw5PlayAll: Another gimsu? I hope I spelled that correctly...
	Draw5PlayAll: One thing I hate about Klingon is how hard it is to get a noticeable ' sound without sounding too obvious.

40) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall
	mi_spero: In lojban the ' character makes the English h sound and the . makes the Klingon ' sound, while the x makes the Klingon GH sound.
	mi_spero: Gismu.
	Draw5PlayAll: Oh no. Lojban has that thing too?

41) Felix: Sacrifice Y1 Felix
Move G2 Threat Tarci
Catastrophe Tarci Green
	mi_spero: @Draw5PlayAll yep. Glottal stop, velar fricative, the works. :D
	mi_spero: And it occurs pretty often. .i (glottal stop, i as in eel) denotes the beginning of a sentence. :D

42) mi_spero: Build G1 Bandulami_spero

43) Babamots: Move B1 Ferenginar Kesprytt

44) Draw5PlayAll: Build Y1 Draw5playall

47) Babamots: Build B1 Kesprytt

48) Draw5PlayAll: Discover G1 Draw5playall B3 B3'
	Draw5PlayAll: MiSpero please... ugh. We need blue and red, but it is harder for me to get blue.

49) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	mi_spero: Considerations like that are not even on my radar, sorry. I can kindof sortof handle that sort of thing in two player games, but I've messed it up in like every game I've played.

50) mi_spero: Build G2 Bandulami_spero

51) Babamots: Sacrifice Y2 Ferenginar
Move B1 Kesprytt Mi_spero

53) Felix: Sacrifice Y2 Felix
Move G1 Felix Mi_spero
Move G3 Felix Mi_spero
Catastrophe Mi_spero Green
	Draw5PlayAll: Oh no.
	Draw5PlayAll: Hmmm... counting on Felix not giving up his only large ship to destroy mi_spero.

54) Babamots: Build Y1 Kesprytt

55) Draw5PlayAll: Trade G2 B2 Draw5playall
	Felix: Shrug. Risky, but probably worth it! Sorry mi_spero! Go get him, Babamots!

56) Felix: Trade R1 G1 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: I think I will destroy Felix, but then Babamots wilL destroy my own homeworld.

57) Babamots: Move Y1 Kesprytt Ferenginar
	Babamots: That would be kind of convenient since the system will only know that the game over when one player is left. If two allies were left, I guess we'd have to time it out or resign.

58) Draw5PlayAll: Move B2 Draw5playall Kesprytt

59) Felix: Build Y2 Felix

	Felix: Yay!

78) Babamots: Move Y1 Ferenginar B3
Catastrophe B3 Y
	Babamots: I kind of wanted to finish a game without getting a green ship, but that's probably not the best strategy.

79) Draw5PlayAll: Trade G2 R2 Draw5playall

80) Felix: Build G2 Felix

81) Babamots: Trade Y2 R2 Bandulami_spero

82) Draw5PlayAll: Build G2 Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: I just hate how seats are alphabetical, not random. It is annoying in Sinister and 2v2.
	Felix: You should suggest it for SDG 2.0

83) Felix: Discover G1 Felix B1 Spindar

84) Babamots: Attack G1E Bandulami_spero
	Babamots: Really? Seating isn't random? That's a major flaw, especially in sinister.

91) Babamots: Trade R2 Y2 Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: I hate that my teammate got booted so early.
	Felix: "Give in to your hatred. It will only make you stronger." - Emperor Palpatine.
 
Such is the nature of 2v2. 

92) Babamots: Attack R2W Draw5playall

	Draw5PlayAll: Why did my R2 need to be overtaken?
	Babamots: I don't know. The system said it was my turn, so I took a turn. I had hoped I could just keep playing with no opponents and use up all the pieces.
	Felix: Good game all! Pleasure being your teammate Babamots!
