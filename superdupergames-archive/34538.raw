	mneme: I'm not quite sure where you're heading here mentally, but I'd be willing to accept a draw here.  It feels to me like most aggressive actions are likely to disrupt the attacker much more than the defender.
	Babamots: I thought I was about to make a very good move, but you have a tricky response that actually makes it terrible.
 
I know what you mean about it being super hard to attack, but I'm not quite ready to call it a draw. I've got a few ideas of how I may yet get an upper hand. I'm afraid I don't have any idea how you might get ahead, though :-P.

65) mneme: Move B2 Orion Mneme
	Draw5PlayAll: What move?
	Draw5PlayAll: Maybe answer in a PM and link to this position in the archive,
	mneme: There are a few ways.  Mostly through your making a mistake, but not entirely.

	Babamots: Wow, very good game! So many games end because of a blunder, but you played well every step of the way.
	mneme: The same.  If you'd ever let me have a y2, much less a y3 before you were all set up, it would have been a very different game!
