	Draw5PlayAll: (if the game does not end next move please send response via private message)
	deanthebean: Well played ajo! @Draw5PlayAll: ajo's plan is to sacrifice one of their g3s to build 2 fleets in deanthebean and thereby send it supernova. I couldn't find a defence. Can you?  
	Draw5PlayAll: sac Y3 Venus
d G2 ipo B3 Denial1
d G2 ipo B3 Denial2
d G2 ipo B3 Denial3
	Draw5PlayAll: (I did not see the green sac at first, but when you said the plan I immediately thought of discovering all the blues)
	ajo: Hmm, true, I didn't see that, and it would have worked... at least as a delaying tactic. And maybe it would have forced me to retreat, since the focus would then shift to red. Well, I'm glad neither of us saw it! ;)
	deanthebean: Yeah. Nice spot! Shame I didn't see it because it would have kept the game interesting though I'm probably losing in any case.
