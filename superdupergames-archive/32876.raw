Homeworlds Online (SDG# 32876)
Started: 2017.8.4, Ended: 2017.8.24
Participants: MobyNostromo (S), Helix (N)
Winner: MobyNostromo

1) Helix: Pass

2) MobyNostromo: H B1 G2 Y3
	Helix: Hi. I'm trying this games which looks very complicated.
	MobyNostromo: Yes. This one is a very complicated one, but it seems to have the depth of Chess or Go. I've played this about ten times now, and I am now starting to feel the incredible possibilities. You're not going to understand it this time or maybe the next couple of times, but you will soon find a strategy you might want to use, and then the game will slowly start to make sense. Be patient.

3) Helix: Pass
	Helix: Could you show me an example of first move (how to write it)?
	Draw5PlayAll: The homeworld move is: homeworld [star] [star] [ship] e.g. homeworld B3 R1 G3.
When it comes time to build your second ship, use:
build G1 Helix
(Or B1, Y1, or R1... the same color as your initial ship.)
	Draw5PlayAll: Oh, and there should not be a period in the homeworld command.

4) MobyNostromo: B Y1 Mobynostromo
	Helix: Sorry, I saw your answers after I moved.

5) Helix: Homeworld B3 R1 G3

6) MobyNostromo: B Y1 Mobynostromo
	Helix: Thanks to Draw5PlayAll
	MobyNostromo: Me too. Thanks to Draw5PlayAll.
