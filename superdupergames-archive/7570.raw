	TwoShort: OK, now I'm just stalling...  Excellent game, well done!  I'm not sure whether you're even aware of my "ZPIP Challenge", but this makes you the probable winner... (My game vs. Keith started before this one, but I'm pretty confident I'll win that one.)
	MikeYarrum: Cool, thanks! As you probably figured out, I learned almost everything I know about Homeworlds through trial and (mostly) error on SDG, so it's cool to finally see myself making a bit of progress.
 
It's funny how zoltar has warned me about playing against you, when I've yet to win a game against him. 
 
And a quick Google led me to a blog which I guess is yours. Good job on those zero pointers! I'd make some myself, but I'm not ready to butcher my 3-pointers.
