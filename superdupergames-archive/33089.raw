	Remneb: I try to do the same and the program told me that the rule was to choose a small yellow firts !
	mneme: If you sacrifice your g2 at Rob, the pieces ather (y1, g2) go back to the bank before you start doing grow actions--so you end up not being able to reach the y3.  This was why I set up the grow in the first place--with your only g2 on a lone y1 system, you didn't have time to reach it first.
 
I'd try to play out some endgames were I you, rather than resigning when it seems hopeless. The endgame is probably the toughest part of the game, and many, many games turn on an endgame being bungled resulting in a game turning around.
 
Obviously, if I had an unblockable lethal, it's different, but with your having r2s, that wasn't going to happen quickly unless I could trigger a catastrophe in your home system.
