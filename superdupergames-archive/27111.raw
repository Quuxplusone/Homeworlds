Participants: Takvorian (S), wil (N)
Winner: wil

1) wil: Homeworld Y3 B1 G3
	wil: welcome back!

2) Takvorian: Homeworld B2 R1 G3
	Takvorian: Hello again! Hopefully I will perform a bit better than in our last game.
By the way, I entered the Homeworlds ladder and already won my first game. After two moves my opponent was timed out...
Probably he had to think too long because of my clever moves ;)

3) wil: Build G1 Wil
	wil: lol....  now ya got me scared...  played snake oil the other night... have you seen that game?  too much fun!
	wil: But ya done goofed up on this opening...taking a b1 when I already did leaves one in the stash...I trade my g1 for a b1 and you are aced outta blues from the get...if you want to retract and pick adifferent start...

4) Takvorian: Build G1 Takvorian
	Takvorian: Thanks for the hint. You see, I am still as bad as before. I just didn't think that the first move is already so important...
	wil: Yes, you'll develop your favorite opening moves (mine is a form of banker...but banker seems to be a slight advantage(not confirmed due to better players simply choosing it)) So as an intragalactic warlord training a young starship captain is is only appropriate that I not take banker...(I should start with fortress as I soooo dislike it and should be practicing) and yes..you can lose the game in your first move (making a bad choice of a homeworld and ship)

5) wil: Trade G1 R1 Wil
	wil: I do see an exploit here though....red.. while convention has it that having red in your homeworld is advantageous (protection) I also find it tough when I can move and you can't...should be interesting.  (and when I say you can lose on an opening move, you can still win, but you have to find mistakes to take advantage of...a bad opehing move and you have an uphill battle until you do)

6) Takvorian: Trade G1 R1 Takvorian
	Takvorian: Thanks for your comments, trainer. These are really helpful for me, because this game is still a mystery for me.
	Takvorian: What abaout choosing the same sizes as your opponent and making the universe smaller this way. Do you recommend this?
	wil: we hate that...a short universe changes soooo much.   I don't know if anyone does it intentionally....usually a mistake (be worth considering though)

7) wil: Build R2 Wil

8) Takvorian: Build R2 Takvorian
	Takvorian: in our last game I took a y here and got in severe trouble without any r, so let's see what will happen now...

24) Takvorian: Trade Y1 R1 Takvorian

25) wil: Discover R2 Wil G2 Gee2
	wil: Okee dokee...figuring out attacks is a tough one sometimes...everything is a move...so you have to have the jump.  I can right now attack your r2 you moved in.  I will sacrifice an r1 in my homeworld and attack your r2 (turn it around to be mine) should I proceed or would yoiu like to back up?
	Takvorian: omg, I really suck...
So I did take back my stupid move.

	wil: lol...oh crap...I didn't really look!! You did what I was gonna do next...before I mentioned it...sheesh...nice move!
	Takvorian: You expect too much from me, I don't know what you plan.
