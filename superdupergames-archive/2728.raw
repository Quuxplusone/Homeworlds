	TwoShort: Sometimes doing something that seems obviously bad (like letting you monopolize yellow) is secretly brilliant...  I wish I thought this was one of those times.

	TwoShort: I love these simple, straight-forward games, without too many peices in play all at once...
	jeep: Me too... I mean it must be simple, right?  Only two pyramids in the stash, how many options can there be?
	jeep: Yeah, this is a thinker.  I'll have to set it up, I think.  It's hard to keep scrolling.
	TwoShort: I've taken to copying the tough ones into MSPaint and pushing them around there...
	jeep: You have more numbers and better position.  I have more large ships.  You have a complete monopoly on G and I have most of Y.  Tough game.
	jeep: Sorry this is taking so long.  Just leting you know I'm thinking about it.

55) TwoShort: Move Y3 Grogar Bellina
	jeep: Pshew... again, I'm hoping I didn't screw up.

56) jeep: Move B3 Thumb Stage
	TwoShort: Nice to hear you're worried, since I feel like I'm trying to find a way to make a comeback.
	TwoShort: Sorry about that, but I just noticed a possibility... gotta take a look through it...
	TwoShort: OK, figured out why my idea was dumb, back to plan A

	jeep: Sorry... I found a note I wrote and am trying to deciper it.  I have lousy hand writing... but it says to do something if you give up the Y3 like that.

	TwoShort: "Take it" one assumes :)
I figure I'm better off with two two pointers in this case, and my green advantage only helps if there is stuff in the stash...  But your now 5-2 advantage in 3 pointers is not very pleasing to me.
	jeep: I'm beginning to regret not blowing up Y in your homeworld now.  Seemed like I wanted to hold the near monopoly, though... NOW it doesn't seem that way...
	jeep: You do have a 13-8 advantage in ships... and a factory going.  So I'm not feeling like my 5-2 (effectively 5-3) advantage in 3-pointers is that huge.

	TwoShort: Oh, I'll agree that this game is reasonably even; which is interesting to me since my usual rule is that 3-pointers and yellow are what matters.  You have, of course, found a way to prevent my recovering the B3, which was my next plan.
	TwoShort: Push my strength I guess...

	jeep: Not sure if you saw my post in the forum... I have company until Wednesday, so will be slow.  This game is likely the one hit hardest.  I feel like I'm on the downward spiral onw, though.  :(
	TwoShort: Don't worry about being slow; I understand there's more to life than homeworlds.  I am now feeling pretty good about this game; as strategies go, "Take all the peices" seems not so bad :)

	jeep: I think I was in command when I could have destroyed one of your stars, my hesitation probably cost me the game.  :(

90) jeep: Attack Y1N Jeep
	TwoShort: I know I was feeling pretty backed into a corner when you had almost all the yellow and more 3-pointers; classically the things that matter.  But having a factory going when you didn't was sure nice; whatever sacrifices, catastrophes etc. I felt threatened by, I could just make sure I'd be able to mop up the peices afterwards.  Anyway, it was quite interesting and challenging.  Thanks for a good game!
