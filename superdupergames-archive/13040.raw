pedrop: Thanks for the game. It was realy interesting. Cheers.
Mouce: What a wacky game (and ending!); I really enjoyed it! I'm glad that i could introduce to you a different play-style. This game has a surprising amount of depth (I feel that I am scratching the surface as yet), and seems to have been well-honed on this server. I hope we will play again in the near future!
