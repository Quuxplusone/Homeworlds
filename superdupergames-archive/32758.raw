	wil: Cause my guns are bigger than your guns
	wil: Gg
	elrac: I'm surprised it would let me kill myself
	elrac: GG
	elrac: Hmm, I wonder what would have happened if I had caused that catastrophe in your system instead.
	wil: Lol......you would a won !
	wil: No lost, no mutual destruction
	elrac: If I had done that I should have lost, since the game should end when I sacrificed the y3 in elrac, but I wonder how the site would have handled that.
 
Actually, reading the rules, "You are never allowed to take an action or trigger a catastrophe that causes you to own no ships in your Homeworld at the end of 
your turn. You may temporarily abandon your Homeworld during your turn, as long as you own at least one ship in it at the end of 
your turn." I don't think it would have been a legal move, but neither was the move I made.
	elrac: I may send that as a question to Loony Labs.
	elrac: Ah, found that question here https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/991015/what-if-both-homeworlds-destroyed-end-turn-win-los
it would have been a tie.
	elrac: either way, GG
	wil: first time I won a hw game by intimidation!
