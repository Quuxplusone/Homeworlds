Winner: Jesse

1) Jesse: Homeworld B3 R1 G3
wmreed: Hello! I'm pretty much a newb at Homeworlds, but I love it. Do you mind if I ask you questions as we play about strategies, or why you made certain moves?
Jesse: Not at all. Have a good game.

2) wmreed: Homeworld B2 G1 Y3

3) Jesse: Build G1 Jesse
wmreed: You, too! okay, first question: when sacrificing a piece, does that sacrificed piece become available for use ON that turn? In other words, if I sacrifice a G3 piece, can I build that same G3 piece as one of those builds? Is there any difference between the face-to-face implementation and the SDG implementation of that rule?
Jesse: Yes, the sacrificed piece becomes immediately available. The G3 sacrifice you mention is a particularly common example known as the factory. If you sacrifice the last ship in a star system, that system's marker likewise becomes immediately available. SDG's implementation of this is correct.

42) wmreed: Build Y1 Wmreed
Jesse: I think you will find that, although you did knock out half my homeworld, without being able to follow it up to finish the job quickly, you've hurt yourself more than you have me.

43) Jesse: Build G3 Jesse
wmreed: Yes, I was woried about that, but I can't yet see more than one or two moves ahead in Homeworlds. Not seeing where else to go, I decided to try and press.
Jesse: It's often difficult to see very far ahead in the middle game, even for me, but I know it's especially difficult for new players. It is also typical for new players to try to attack when they don't know what else to do. Attacking is difficult and costly in Homeworlds, though. It is usually better to build your forces. Have your red pieces poised? Start building blue so you can hit me with an unstoppable 1-2 smash. Have a numerical superiority in red? See if you can cause a red catastrophe or force a sacrifice that reduces me to one red ship, while you retain a few, and try to increase that advantage. If I have more large ships, you should probably be trying to get more of them yourself, rather than sacrificing them.

46) wmreed: Sacrifice R2 Logan
Attack R3 Wmreed
Attack Y3 Wmreed
Jesse: Another thing that new players often seem to overlook is the ship capture strategy. I find it's often easier to drop a bunch of large ships into the opponent's home system and capture all his defenders than it is to destroy both his stars. It doesn't work if the defender has a large red he is able to sacrifice to capture all my attackers in one shot, though.

47) Jesse: Sacrifice R3 Blarg
Attack R3 Wmreed
Attack R3 Wmreed
Attack Y3 Wmreed
wmreed: If I had sacrificed the R3 in wmreed, is it correct that I would not have been able to attack your large ships?
Jesse: Yes. After the sacrifice, you would have no ships large enough to make the captures.

Jesse: You played a pretty good game, really. You had a strong opening, taking control of red, and kept your homeworld protected. The g2 sacrifice to restore a large ship to your homeworld and simultaneously keep me from it was particularly nice. Trading the R3 for a Y3, letting me build another R3, was not so good though. It would be better to save that for a time when it was difficult for me to build a red ship.
