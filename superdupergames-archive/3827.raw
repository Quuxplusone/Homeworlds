	zoltar: Wow.  I totally missed your last move, Aaron.  This game is fascinating, and the most interesting and complex homeworlds game I've played to date.  We almost exhausted the stash of pieces before I (prematurely) went bananas and started sacking things.  I've recently learned and now have won a few games, even racking up an upset victory against a good player who played too fast, but I still can't even see one move ahead sometimes.  You play lots here: what are your favorite games?  This site is fantastic, and I ought to learn more of them.  I play japanese chess (shogi) and this reminds me of it.  I have even come up for a model of shogi that uses looneylabs pyramids, 4 stashes exactly, for a shogi set, which I think is preferable to the originals with japanese characters.  Do you know how hard it would be to add a pyramid game like that on this site?  It would use a 9x9 board.  As in this game, you can capture pieces and use them as yours, and the orientation of the piece determines to whom it belongs.  
	Aaron: Homeworlds is one of the most difficult games to to wrap your head around.  This is one of my worst games, actually, but I do enjoy it occasionally.  I've been watching your winning streak and am most impressed.  You have done remarkably well, especially now that I know you are just learning.  One day you'll have to have a go against AndyLooney, the creator and almost undefeated Homeworlds champion.  My favourite games would have to be Cannon and Alien City.  I do play often here as I am the site creator and maintainer.  I am very pleased that you are enjoying yourself.  That was the goal =)  I am always looking for new games to add and would be happy to have a look at your Icehouse Shogi.  Send me the rules if you can.  If you program in Perl, you can also have a go at it yourself by visiting the wiki and the API page.

	zoltar: I will take at Canon and Alien City.  I plan to take on the champ Andy Looney soon.  Andy taught me the game in person, insisting that my chess and shogi enthusiasm would spill over to homeworlds;  I lost every game easily, and then came here to play and study the game.  Only after setting up a board and going over all of Andy, Jesse, and TwoShort's games did I start to win, so I'm almost ready to try taking on Andy Looney again.  Btw, while Andy Looney is the creator of the Icehouse pyramids, I just won a game online against the actual creator of the Homeworlds game itself, John "Gort" Cooper!  As for Shogi, I don't program in Perl, so you or someone else would have to do all the hard work, but I'll send you an email with the rules and my mapping of icehouse pieces to shogi pieces. I think it would be perfect for this site.

	Aaron: *sighs*  I am so blind sometimes =/  *ponders deeply...*
	Aaron: Nope.  If I had one more yellow piece I'd have had a chance.  Very well done, zoltar!  You remain SDG's uber-champion =)  Thanks for the game!
