	OnePageWars: I've got a 4 player game available for joining currently. It has the sinister variant, so we'll see how that goes with the adjacent homeworld problem and stuff. :)
	wil: yes, I learned I so disliked the adjacent...I've only got involved with threes since.   and have run into a couple of binaries that were short uni's and that drove me crazy...but if you don't fill it...maybe I'll play if you don't get anyone soon....sinister means you only attack left??

8) OnePageWars: Build G1 Onepagewars
	OnePageWars: yeah. The more I think about it the more I'm tempted to cancel the game and create one that's identical except for 3 players. Acutally, I'm going to go do that now if no-one has joined.
	OnePageWars: My intent was to set it up for three players with one of them being you if you wanted and the other being random? Is that what was created or was a 1v1 challenge inadvertently created?

	OnePageWars: It's only a gun if there's a red with it. :) I'm a peaceful civilization before I start attacking. :)
	OnePageWars: PS - I know that you know the rules of the game, my previous comment was not meant in any way to imply ignorance on your part (which would be an incorrect implication, btw) but rather as a lighthearted joke.
	OnePageWars: I hope I didn't give the wrong impression. Sorry if I did.

	OnePageWars: I'm thinking I should resign this position. I don't see much in the way of not losing, lol.
	wil: You've got a point...I intend on growing big blues and swapping them out for big guns of all colors until I control the Universe bwwahhhaaahhaaa.....but that being said...I've stayed involved under dire straights before, because powere does go to ones head....and the lesser can often tempt the greater and take advantage of their size.  One or two catastrophes and their is a completely new game...  your choice though
	OnePageWars: I think I'll keep going, then, if only to learn how you close out the game so that I can improve. :)

33) wil: Sacrifice G3 G3
Build B3 Wil
Build B3 G3
Build Y2 Wil
	wil: that is what I did....lost dozens of games....and way too many of them the same way....but after a while you begin to see it coming and learn how to defend against it.  look up bluebird and doomsday they are often used.

36) OnePageWars: Build R2 Starcraft2
	wil: this is the risk of leaving your homeworld without a big gun...   Once you did it, I began setting up for this opportunity.... I laid a trap that I hoped you could not resist in blowing up my homeworld...that system was toxic...we were leaving it anyway...since you left, we like what you've done with the place....we think we'll take it.
	OnePageWars: interesting; I think you had me beat just in the economy.

37) wil: Sacrifice R3 Y1
Attack R1 Onepagewars
Attack G1 Onepagewars
Attack R1 Onepagewars
	wil: to me the game is a series of tipping points, I can't always identify them...which move caused it to tip in who's favor....to me the tip was you moving your gun out, it changed my focus...there were a number of moves better than that one at that juncture...if you had a specific intent, it didn't play out. ....observation not condemnation...i am learning as well.
	OnePageWars: No offense taken. I appreciate the constructive criticism. We're both learning. :)
