	wil: Lol, good luck!
	wil: Just tell me how much info you would like.. And if you want me to give you a chance to take back moves I see as terrible...or only report after the fact.

4) wil: B G1 Wil
	RedMerlin: Haha thanks, I'll probably need it... And I think reporting after the fact is helpful enough, unless it's like a game losing mistake

5) RedMerlin: Trade G1 B1 Redmerlin
	wil: I'll do my best to shorten the curve and reduce the number if times you touch the stove... (Unless it contains s valuable lesson)
	RedMerlin: Thanks so much!

6) wil: T G1 B1 Wil
	RedMerlin: Did it matter if I traded for a blue or a yellow there? And if so, which was the better option (taking into account only having 2 B2s and 3 Y3s)?

16) wil: T Y2 R2 Wil

17) RedMerlin: Trade B2 R2 Redmerlin
	wil: Exactly right... Onen thing to keep in mind when this happens is knowing you have a 2 you can trade some time as well...you only get outrun when you don't have the same size

	RedMerlin: That sounds very ominous...
	wil: Crap... I should a let you change that move...sorry...  Next game.
	wil: But that is how a red sacrifice works...
	RedMerlin: Ohhhhh.....

	wil: Yez...everything sacrifices... And next move was in!
