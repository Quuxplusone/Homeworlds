	benji_stein: Fast moves, these. It's great when the opponent happens to be at their computer and we can hammer out a bunch at once. Then again, the early moves don't require as much thinking. ;)
	benji_stein: Ha. Murphy's law. Right when I comment, you go off. *sigh*

14) benji_stein: Sacrifice G2 Benji_stein
Build Y1 Benji_stein
Build B1 Benji_stein
	TwoShort: I'm at work, so when the email comes in, if I've got a second and the move is clear, I'll make it.  It means you don't get so much in the way of strategy advice though.
	TwoShort: Anyway, the general strategy advice is in the early game, focus mainly on trying to get more 3 pointers than the other guy.
  Tactics-wise, sacrificing a g3 such that you regrow the same piece you sacrificed is called the "Factory", and can be devastating if I can keep doing it and you can't.  Also note that by growing that 3rd G in your homeworld, you have no place to  build another G so I was free to leave the last g3 available.
	benji_stein: Ouch. You're right; I'd missed that move. Very nice. Makes sense about work, I do the same, though I try not to check my personal mail too often.
 
The advice is always appreciated, but I do understand being busy. I probably shouldn't do this, but at least it prevents you from getting the final green so easily...

15) TwoShort: Trade G2 Y2 Bluonia

16) benji_stein: Discover G1 Benji_stein B1 Retch

17) TwoShort: Discover G2 Bluonia Y1 Yolonda

18) benji_stein: Move B1 Benji_stein Retch

19) TwoShort: Build G2 Yolonda
	TwoShort: Forgot you were playing a 2-3 Homeworld.  FYI, conventional wisdom holds that 1-2 is the best...

20) benji_stein: Build G2 Retch
	benji_stein: No problem. I often play a 1-2, but they all have advantages. With a 2-3, I can lock you out of a large piece, plus it's harder to reach my homeworld if there aren't many small pieces left in the stash.

21) TwoShort: Sacrifice G3 Twoshort
Build G3 Bluonia
Build G3 Twoshort
Build Y2 Bluonia

22) benji_stein: Build B2 Retch
	benji_stein: I know you're about to use your factory to get the last two greens, but there's nothing I can do to stop you. swapping a green out only cuts me out of it entirely, and building a green just lets you get something of a different color as well (probably yellow)

23) TwoShort: Trade G3 B3 Bluonia
	benji_stein: aww, screw it. I can't afford to only have one green ship. *sigh*

24) benji_stein: Sacrifice Y1 Benji_stein

Catastrophe Bluonia B

27) TwoShort: Move G2 Yolonda Benji_stein

28) benji_stein: Trade B1 R1 Benji_stein
	benji_stein: Ha. I knew there was a reason I was keeping a y1 around - I can't easily get into that system.
This is probably a really bad idea, but I feel like that system is just too powerful to pass it up.

29) TwoShort: Sacrifice G3 Twoshort
Build G1 Benji_stein
Build Y2 Twoshort
Build G3 Twoshort
Catastrophe Benji_stein Green
	TwoShort: Yeah, giving up your 3 point pretty much spells doom;  it means my 3 is invulnerable to red, so I can win if I take a red and march the three to your Homeworld without your getting a 3 of blowing mine up.  In this case, I'm going to start by shortening the march :)

30) benji_stein: Sacrifice G1 Retch
Build R1 Benji_stein

31) TwoShort: Trade Y2 R2 Twoshort

32) benji_stein: Trade R1 G1 Benji_stein
	benji_stein: Yeah, I figure it'll be difficult, but I think if I hadn't done it I would have been doomed pretty quickly, as well.
	benji_stein: crud. I knew there was a reason I'd wanted to swap the green one. I switched it to the 1-pointer so I could keep my green in case I wanted to build several ships at once. *sigh* 

33) TwoShort: Move G3 Twoshort Benji_stein

34) benji_stein: Build R1 Benji_stein

	benji_stein: Yeah, it's yours. I thought I could stave it off a little longer, but you just sac your red ship to take both of my reds. I build another green, and you blow them all up with the g1 from your homeworld.
 
Interesting game, though I must say it was pretty miserable on my part.
