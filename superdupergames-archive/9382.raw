1) MikeYarrum: Homeworld R3 B2 G3
	MikeYarrum: Okay, here's your training game. Pardon me if I go over something you already know.
 
The most important thing is picking a good Homeworld. If you don't have any green technology to start with, you'll either have to trade for it (and waste a valuable turn). It's also good to start with blue, or you'll be stuck with only one kind of color in your Homeworld, unless you waste turns moving different colors back to your Homeworld.
 
For beginningers, a Homeworld of one small and one medium is recommended, with a combination of yellow-blue-green technology. Some advanced players, myself included, prefer a large-medium Homeworld with blue-red-green technology.
 
You can pick whatever size ship you'd like to start with, but there's no reason you'd want to go with anything except a 3-pointer.

2) wyons: Homeworld G1 B2 Y3

3) MikeYarrum: Build G1 Mikeyarrum
	wyons: thanks that is all just the help I need
	MikeYarrum: Okay, but if you have any questions at all, feel free to ask. =D

4) wyons: Build Y1 Wyons
	wyons: --I wasnt saying that was enough - I was saying it was good. :) please keep going. :)

5) MikeYarrum: Trade G1 Y1 Mikeyarrum

6) wyons: Discover Y1 Wyons G3 Spinach
	MikeYarrum: Oh, my bad! I'll keep going.
 
Well, right now my red technology isn't helping, which puts you at the advantage. You'll want to build as many yellow ships as possible, to keep me from getting any. But I took the first opportunity I had to trade an extra ship for yellow (again, some new players will waste time trading instead of building - but this was a good time to trade). Now, it wouldn't be wise of you to build another yellow ship, because that puts you at three yellow ships in your Homeworld - if you built any after that, I could catastrophe and destroy all of your ships. Plus, I could build a 2-point yellow if you took the last 1-point yellow.
 
So, this gives you several options. You could trade your 1-point yellow for a blue or a green, but you already have those technologies in your Homeworld (it's always wise to have ships of different colors, but one-pointers of colors you already have don't help much). Also, trading for red at this point might not be a good idea, since you wouldn't have any use for it yet.
 
I'd recommend discovering a 3-point Green system with your one-point yellow. This not only takes away a 3-point Green that I would definitely want to build later in the game, but gives you another place to safely build more yellow ships (that's the big reason to discover new systems - room to build).

7) MikeYarrum: Build G1 Mikeyarrum
	wyons: OK, that all makes sense.... I shall certainly take your advice!

8) wyons: Build Y1 Wyons
	MikeYarrum: Besides discovering a new system like you did, I can only build another green ship. I could trade it my next turn, or maybe use it for discovery later. Keeping at least one green ship around also allows me to have a "factory" later in the game (which means sacrificing a green 3 pointer, building twice, then re-building the green 3 pointer I just sacrificed). Naturally, I can only do this much later in the game - otherwise, I'd be forced to build the smallest green ship available, which would usually mean losing my 3 pointer.
 
This puts you in a tricky situation - You're in a much better position to build yellow ships than I am, because you already have two systems to do it in. However, building any more yellow ships would mean I get first chance to build a 2-point yellow.
 
Let's just see how it plays out. =D (make sure you play against other people - my strategy isn't the only one you can use!)
	wyons: if you sacrifice a yellow two pointer can you hop from system a to b to c (assuming they are connected)?

9) MikeYarrum: Build Y2 Mikeyarrum
	wyons: OK so I am going to allow you a two pointer yellow because I dont really see how else I can develop effectively...   :)
	MikeYarrum: Yes, that's right. Also, because you can only attack ships that are the same size or smaller, larger ships mean you have more opportunities to attack, but can more easily defend.
	MikeYarrum: Oh, and don't forget - it's entirely legal (at least in the SDG system) to "discover" a system, then abandon it the same turn. So, for example, you could sacrifice your 3 point yellow, "discover" a 1 point system, then move directly into my homeworld in one turn, abandoning spinach and the 1 point system in the process.
 
Not that you'd want to, but if a similar situation comes up...

10) wyons: Build Y2 Spinach

11) MikeYarrum: Trade Y1 R1 Mikeyarrum
	wyons: thanks, I hadnt realised that and it is a useful tactic. 

12) wyons: Trade Y1 R1 Wyons

13) MikeYarrum: Discover G1 Mikeyarrum B1 Ena

14) wyons: Build Y1 Wyons

15) MikeYarrum: Build G1 Mikeyarrum
	MikeYarrum: Oh, by the way, I noticed how you traded that one point yellow away - that's always a good tactic to keep the higher-pointers away, if you didn't already know.
 
Doesn't work later in the game, when there's barely anything to trade for, though.

16) wyons: Trade Y1 B1 Wyons
	wyons: hmm , I've let you get a nice line in green..

17) MikeYarrum: Build G2 Ena
	MikeYarrum: Yes... apparently, this wasn't the best strategy for you.
 
Unfortunately, I seem to run into a similar problem in my games against zoltar - we get into a game of "chicken" about giving the other first crack at the big pieces, and he always seems to come out ahead. So I really didn't have much advice about the situation - try playing against some others. ^_^
	MikeYarrum: *by "others", I mean both more games, and against other people.

18) wyons: Move B1 Wyons Spinach

19) MikeYarrum: Trade G2 R2 Ena
	wyons: I am playing several other games.... :) And I am also not sure now about the wisdom of building a green star in the home world. I'd rather have a green ship and a red and blue star. A green star means you also have to have a green ship in order to build green- and that opens you up to easier attack. :)
	MikeYarrum: True, but usually you build whatever color ship you started with, then discover either blue systems to either trade for green or green systems.
