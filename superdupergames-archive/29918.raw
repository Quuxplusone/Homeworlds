2) Draw5PlayAll: Homeworld R1 B2 G3
	Felix: RAWR!!!!

3) Kalimantan: Homeworld B3 R1 G3
	Draw5PlayAll: I was actually predicting a me-Felix-someone setup, where the someone was "likely Steele, unlikely ts52"...

4) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	Felix: Interesting that everyone chose the same colors as me! Looks like we'll be fighting for yellow :P

5) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall

7) Felix: Trade G1 Y1 Felix

8) Draw5PlayAll: Trade G1 Y1 Draw5playall

10) Felix: B G1 Felix

11) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall
	Felix: The first few moves are typically the same, but the possibilities become endless pretty quickly :)

12) Kalimantan: Discover Y1 Kalimantan G2 Dagoba
	Draw5PlayAll: Well, with a finite number of pieces and a finite number of possible positions....

13) Felix: Trade G1 R1 Felix

14) Draw5PlayAll: Trade G1 B1 Draw5playall

22) Felix: Build Y2 Felix

23) Draw5PlayAll: Discover G1 Draw5playall B3 Traderpool

24) Kalimantan: Build Y2 Kalimantan
	Draw5PlayAll: I see you two have been throwing your Y and R ships at green planets, while I send a green ship to a blue planet.

25) Felix: Move Y1 Felix Rim

26) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Traderpool

27) Kalimantan: Trade Y2 R2 Kalimantan

30) Kalimantan: Move R2 Kalimantan Dagoba

31) Felix: Move R2 Rim Heh

32) Draw5PlayAll: Sacrifice B1 Heh
Trade Y2 R2 Draw5playall

33) Kalimantan: Move R2 Dagoba Rim
	Felix: *cue Jaws music* :)

34) Felix: Build R3 Rim
	Draw5PlayAll: See, *THIS* is my problem. I get my development too slow and I end up behind the race for the large ships, particularly yellow.
	Felix: It can be hard to keep up, especially in a 3p game. But it's arguably more important to develop red when your opponents do. That way you at least will be less likely to lose ships.

35) Draw5PlayAll: Trade G1 B1 Traderpool

36) Kalimantan: Build R3 Rim
Catastrophe Rim R
	Draw5PlayAll: I cannot resist!!
	Draw5PlayAll: Darn, I wanted to explode the reds at rim, but I cannot. Oh well, TraderPool needs support.

37) Felix: Build Y2 Felix

38) Draw5PlayAll: Build B1 Traderpool

39) Kalimantan: Build G1 Kalimantan

40) Felix: Trade Y2 B2 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: This is safe because I have control of the blue economy.

41) Draw5PlayAll: Trade B1 R1 Traderpool

42) Kalimantan: Trade G3 R3 Kalimantan
	Felix: Not any more :)

43) Felix: Build Y2 Felix

44) Draw5PlayAll: Discover R2 Draw5playall Y3 Port

45) Kalimantan: Build G1 Kalimantan

46) Felix: Build G2 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: I think I was playing ts52 or someone and I discovered two yellow stars as a plot to destroy the other guy's homeworld. I named them "Port1" and "Port2", so now "Port" is my name for any Y3 star system.

47) Draw5PlayAll: Build G2 Traderpool

48) Kalimantan: Trade G1 B1 Kalimantan
	Felix: Sounds like a plan. I shall name all my red ships "Port Destroyer" then ;)

49) Felix: Discover Y2 Felix B1 Ice
	Draw5PlayAll: This game (With 3P) has a lot of diplomacy. If Felix got too strong, the other two players can agree to each send a ship of the same color into his homeworld, which prevents the need for sacrificing while still attacking the enemy.
 
Perhaps that game was with Simon or nycavri...I do not think it was ts52.

50) Draw5PlayAll: Trade G2 Y2 Traderpool

51) Kalimantan: Move B1 Kalimantan Dagoba

52) Felix: Sacrifice G3 Felix
Build Y3 Felix
Build Y3 Rim
Build Y3 Ice
	Draw5PlayAll: Next blue planet should be Icehouse...

53) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall

54) Kalimantan: Sacrifice Y2 Kalimantan
Move Y1 Dagoba Ice
Move Y1 Dagoba Ice
Catastrophe Ice Y
	Felix: That would be clever :) 

55) Felix: Sacrifice Y1 Rim
Move R2 Heh Dagoba

56) Draw5PlayAll: Build G2 Traderpool

57) Kalimantan: Build G2 Kalimantan
	Draw5PlayAll: I wish I could sac my G1 and build the G2 before the G1 is returned to the stash

58) Felix: Build G3 Felix

59) Draw5PlayAll: Sacrifice G3 Draw5playall
Build G3 Draw5playall
Build R2 Port
Build Y1 Traderpool

60) Kalimantan: Build G3 Kalimantan

61) Felix: Attack B1S Dagoba
	Draw5PlayAll: I really need to get some of my ships off of TraderPool before it goes supernova!

62) Draw5PlayAll: Discover G2 Traderpool B2 Icehouse
	Draw5PlayAll: That is also a good move.
	Draw5PlayAll: I would not be surprised if Felix sacrificed his Y3@Felix to send his G2@Felix to Kalimantan, exploding your army. Which would only help me.

63) Kalimantan: Trade G2 Y2 Kalimantan

64) Felix: Build R3 Dagoba
	Draw5PlayAll: I tried to distance my ship from the evils that await in the direction of Polaris. It was a choice between sending a blue to a green system (which would not work) or a green to a blue system.

65) Draw5PlayAll: D R2 Port Y1 Port5

66) Kalimantan: Discover R3 Kalimantan Y2 Yarvin

67) Felix: Trade R3 Y3 Dagoba

69) Kalimantan: Discover R3 Yarvin Y1 Hoth
	Felix: About time to attack :)

70) Felix: Discover G2 Felix B1 Flip

71) Draw5PlayAll: Move B1 Traderpool Port5
	Draw5PlayAll: Well, I do not like this... But I have a plan.

72) Kalimantan: Build G3 Kalimantan

73) Felix: Sacrifice Y3 Felix
Move G2 Flip Dagoba
Move G2 Dagoba Kalimantan
Move Y3 Dagoba Kalimantan
Catastrophe Kalimantan Green

74) Draw5PlayAll: Discover R1 Traderpool G1 Treehouse

75) Kalimantan: Move R3 Hoth Felix

76) Felix: Sacrifice R1 Felix
Attack Y2S Kalimantan
	Felix: *spaceship noises*
	Draw5PlayAll: This only helps me.

77) Draw5PlayAll: Sacrifice Y2 Traderpool
Move R1 Treehouse Felix
Move R2 Port5 Felix
Catastrophe Felix R
	Draw5PlayAll: The thing about a 3P battle is that here Felix sacrificed many resources to bomb Kalimantan, meaning I will have an edge. However, the Kalimantan system is now like a second homeworld, because the star is intact.
 
A quick pip count shows that I have 22 pips of ships while Felix has 17. Notice that he has more larges (but I can craft larges easily)...
 
Interesting game.

78) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	Draw5PlayAll: I wonder if anyone caught my reasons for the name Treehouse. Apart from being a green planet, of course.

79) Draw5PlayAll: Sacrifice G3 Draw5playall
Build G2 Traderpool
Build G3 Draw5playall
Build B1 Port5
	Felix: Sorry about that, Kalimantan. That's just how it goes sometimes! And I'm guessing you named it because of the other looney pyramid game, Treehouse?
	Kalimantan: Well gg. Let me know if you guys do a 3p again. I want in. Is 4p offered at sdg? Anyway 3p and up I definitely want to participate.  Thanks for a grest game.

80) Felix: Sacrifice Y3 Kalimantan
Move G3 Felix Draw5playall
Move G1 Felix Draw5playall
Move B2 Felix Draw5playall
Catastrophe Draw5playall Green
	Draw5PlayAll: Note to self. Be careful.
 
I like the spite/revenge move that Kalimantan did.
	Draw5PlayAll: 4P is offered, but I do not like it because it creates sizing problems.

81) Draw5PlayAll: Sacrifice G2 Icehouse
Build Y1 Draw5playall
Build Y2 Draw5playall

82) Felix: Trade B2 Y2 Draw5playall
Catastrophe Draw5playall Yellow
	Draw5PlayAll: I think when I built a G2, my mind assumed I had reinstated the factory...

	Draw5PlayAll: Hahaha you do not have enough red!!
	Felix: Who needs red? :)
	Draw5PlayAll: Do you think I had any way out? It did not look like it.
	Draw5PlayAll: Good game though.
	Felix: I didn't see any way out for you. The move you used was probably the best you could have used, but unlucky for you I had a blue ship so I could trade it for the color your had! Great game.
	Draw5PlayAll: Oh, I was predicting some freak move with sacrificing a large yellow and then taking over. You could have preserved my base, at the cost of Kalimantan's.
