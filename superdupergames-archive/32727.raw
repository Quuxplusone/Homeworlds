	Ausmuh: Usually at the beginning of the game it's building and trading. I'm not totally sure you needed to move to a red planet. I'm two moves away from that planet and I don't have any move myself so me attacking you is not a threat.  Just a thought. If Draw5 is watching, maybe they'd like to give a pointer or two also.
	Draw5PlayAll: I am watching. I usually prefer to start with green as the ship instead of the star. I consider green and yellow to be important colors and I like the chance to have them in my homeworld without fear of a catastrophe of my stars.
 
At Corneria, you have no ability to build or trade. However that system CAN be useful if you manage to get a green there.
	AcetyleneLamp: Thanks for the advice. I don't really know what I'm doing, as you may have guessed.
	Draw5PlayAll: Ausmuh undid their last move and has not made a new one.
 
Acetylene, you should probably build another Y1 and then trade it for a green. And for future reference you may want to look at this game: http://superdupergames.org/main.html?page=archive_play&gid=32306 (in progress as of now). My opponent played with a G1 star and has since gotten no green ships at all.
	Ausmuh: Thanks and sorry!! 
 
Busy at work but I'm back!
 
It's ok to not know what you're doing yet. We can cruise around space getting our bearings.
 
Normally I'd trade My small blue for a small yellow. That way when you build... It would have to be a small yellow too. Then I'd get to grab a medium first. If you follow that.
 
Instead I'll just take another blue. You definitely want to get some build to Corneria soon.
 
Let me know if you're having trouble following!

14) Ausmuh: Move Y1 Ausmuh Zog
	Ausmuh: Nice. Now you have a little outpost (Corneria). To be connected to my homeworld you will need to move out from a 3-pip planet to a 1-pip planet. You're also spread out a little so acquiring new ships will be easier without being afraid of Catastrophe.
 
We have also opened up 2-pips in the bank. Collecting a 2-pip ship or two can be quite useful.
 
As it stands, no one has build an attack ship. You usually don't need to collect attack, but if your opponent arms themselves, you will want to do the same. 
 
This is where the game can get overwhelming sometimes so don't hesitate to ask questions and always take what I say with a grain of salt - there are many better players then me. :)

15) AcetyleneLamp: Trade Y2 R2 Acetylenelamp
	Draw5PlayAll: Also I am disinterested in the result and Ausmuh is not.

	AcetyleneLamp: Was afraid my red pieces at Corneria were going to get catastrophed, after I made my last move, I check the rules again and saw that four pieces (either stars or ships) of the same color are enough for a catastrophe, I initially thought it was just ships.

33) AcetyleneLamp: Attack Y1 Zawg
