I thought you would sac the y2 to stand up the last b2, then build a b3 on your next turn. I am still not sure who wins this.

40) wil: T B1 R1 G3
	dlwillson: Yuck. Should I have resigned, instead?

41) dlwillson: Sacrifice G1 Wil
Build R2 Wil
Catastrophe Wil R
	wil: What situation?
	wil: Oh the back and forth?
	wil: If I had moved blues in younkust needed tonturn blue...yeah wild end
	wil: Ties are so rare
	dlwillson: That game could have ended in an eternal tug-of-war over the green, but you invoked a ko rule on yourself that doesn't exist anywhere in the actual rules. I do the same, and I try to avoid the situation to begin with, but I wish there were an actual rule, or at least a formal protocol.
	dlwillson: I think you could have pulled ahead at "2018-08-14 11:23:47" if you had sacrificed your Y2 ship to discover the last B2 from the bank using any ship from the G3 system. I wouldn't have been able to swap to blue, and you would have been able to build a B3 on your next turn.
