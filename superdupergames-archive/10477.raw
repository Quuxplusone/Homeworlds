sordros: Hmm... definitely need more practice, didn't see that coming :-)
sordros: Thanks for the game.
Keith: It was the small universe. We were only two apart rather than three. Where three of a color are easily threatend with a y3, here, two of a kind are easily threatened if one ship is one away.
Keith: It was heavier handed than I like, however, it is in keeping with the ladder system. I am available for a less heavy handed unrated game if you like.
sordros: Ok, let me finish up some of my unfinished games and I'll start one up. I think I can learn a lot from playing with you :-)
