	Draw5PlayAll: For some reason it always takes me way longer than I want to win... maybe because I am always afraid of letting the opponent come back.
	capi3101: Well, the material advantage you've got at this point is impressive, to say the least. You're one move away from being able to pull off a textbook direct assault unless I'm very much mistaken.
	capi3101: I'll play on for now. If I've learned anything, it's that this game is incredibly unforgiving of mistakes and even the most experienced players can still commit them.
