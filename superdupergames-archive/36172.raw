Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2020.3.16, Ended: 2020.3.16
Participants: Babamots (S), Pib (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) Pib: Homeworld B1 G1 Y3 *

2) Babamots: Homeworld B3 G3 Y3 *
	Babamots: I recently learned that SDG allows a player to abandon their homeworld (and lose), but ONLY IF there is no enemy ship there.
 
This is an experimental game to test whether SDG allows TEMPORARY homeworld abandonment when an enemy ship is present.

3) Pib: Build Y1 Pib

4) Babamots: Build Y1 Babamots

5) Pib: Move Y1 Pib Babamots

6) Babamots: Move Y1 Babamots Pib

7) Pib: Sacrifice Y3 Pib
Move Y1 Babamots Pib
Move Y1 Pib Babamots
Move Y1 Babamots Pib

	Babamots: SDG DOES allow you to temporarily abandon your homeworld, even if an enemy ship is there.
	Draw5PlayAll: Wait... so what happens if I leave my homeworld empty for a moment, but then try to return?
	Babamots: I've tried that in other games. SDG allows you to leave you homeworld totally empty and then returning a ship to it. Pib's back-and-forth move would also have been possible if I had not had a ship at their home.
