	Jesse: Hello, bennyb.  Played much Homeworlds?

4) Jesse: Build Y1 Jesse
	bennyb: no first game :)  I've got no idea what I'm doing ;)

	Jesse: Okay, the first thing to do is look at the tips for new players on the wiki.  (There's also a good exposition of basic strategy at the icehousegames wiki.  There's a link from the SDG wiki page.)
	Jesse: Then, my personal recommendation would be to switch your r3 for a y3.  Or, you may prefer to switch the r1 for a y1.  But one way or another, you need to (a) diversify and (b) move out to other systems.  Not necessarily immediately, but soon.
