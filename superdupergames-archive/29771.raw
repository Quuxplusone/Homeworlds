Winner: Felix

1) Felix: Homeworld B3 Y2 G3
	Felix: Hi! First game? Hope you have fun. Let me know if you have any questions.

2) dijek: Homeworld G1 Y3 B3
	dijek: Yes, I thought this game looked interesting, although it seems fairly simple.

3) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	dijek: Is there any limit to the number of systems, other than the size of the global stash?
	Felix: No limit. There can be as many as the global stash will allow!

4) dijek: Build B1 Dijek

5) Felix: Trade G1 B1 Felix

6) dijek: Discover B1 Dijek R2 Galois
	Felix: The game seems fairly simple, but I assure you it is anything but. It becomes incredibly complex, and the strategy is very deep and takes many games to truly figure out. 
	dijek: Yes, I only meant the rules seemed easy enough to understand. The strategy of easy to learn games is often quite fun and complex. :)

7) Felix: Discover B1 Felix G1 Littlewood
	Felix: True! Yes, I think that's what makes a game great. Easy to understand rules, but depth of strategy. Hive is another favorite of mine for that reason.

8) dijek: Build B1 Dijek
	dijek: I am not endangering Golois for next turn, I think, because although you could build a b2 in littlewood now, you could not yet move it.
	dijek: Oh, but you could attack even with the smallest ship size; it is greater than or equal to.

9) Felix: Build B2 Littlewood
	Felix: Right. I can't move my ship there right now without a yellow. And even if I could move it there, I can't move and attack on the same turn, so you could just attack my ship as soon as it arrived. I would want to move a bigger ship into your system if I wanted to attack.

10) dijek: Build B2 Dijek
	Felix: The early game is usually more focused on just building up your fleet as quickly as possible. Blue is a good color to go for at this point, as you can see I'm doing. And spreading your blue ships out to green planets is useful so you can keep building faster.

	dijek: I can't stop it

41) Felix: Sacrifice Y1 Littlewood
Move G1 Othlorien Dijek
	Felix: I'm afraid I do :) Sorry...
	Felix: Except I can't get it yet.... if I did, it would leave me open to a counterattack by you that could take out all of my green and destroy me. So I must be patient...

42) dijek: Trade G3 R3 Dijek

43) Felix: Build G2 Dijek
	Felix: Ooh, nice one.

44) dijek: Build R1 Dijek
	dijek: Are you supposed to be able to trigger a catastrophe during the middle of your turn? The rules here say the end, but those on the looney labs site say any time.

45) Felix: Build G3 Dijek
Catastrophe Dijek Green
	Felix: There's always been some confusion over that. You're right about the rule difference between here and Looney Labs. In my opinion, Looney Labs has the rules correct, and I play that way when I play real games, but yeah, unfortunately the implementation of the rules on here only allows you to catastrophe at the end of your turn. I wish it were different, as there have been opportunities where it could have been really handy!

46) dijek: Trade R1 G1 Dijek
	dijek: I guess it would change the strategy, especially since it stops you from doing multiple catastrophes at once.
	dijek: I guess it would change the strategy, especially since it stops you from doing multiple catastrophes at once.
	dijek: Oh wow, this attack is really good

47) Felix: Build G1 Felix

48) dijek: Trade B1 Y1 Galois
	Felix: Thank you! Yeah, I hadn't thought about being able to do two catastrophes in one turn, but that would be awesome if you could pull it off!

	Felix: I got utterly destroyed the first 20 or so games I played on here, so don't be discouraged!
