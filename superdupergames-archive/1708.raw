	SYSTEM: Yobi resigns.
	Lexicon: Hmmm.  Seems to have skipped me.
	ts52: That's really odd. I wonder why that happned.
You man want to point this one out to Aaron. I'll hold off doing anything for a while if you want. Or maybe I can just pass, I'll check.

4) ts52: Build Y1 Ts52
	ts52: Aha, it did let me just pass. Now you should be able to establish a homeworld.
	Aaron: Thanks for passing, ts.  I have had problems with the resignation code from the beginning.  I *think* (again) that I have fixed the problem.  We will see when this situation recurs.  Thanks for your patience!
	Lexicon: Thanks guys. :)  

5) Lexicon: Build Y1 Lexicon

6) ts52: Build Y1 Ts52
	ts52: No problem. I don't think the game rules allow passing, but it's nice that it's there so we can work around glitches like this.

	ts52: Ack! I just realized we're now playing a 2 player game with a 4 pyramid economy. This changes everything! :)

7) Lexicon: Trade Y1 G1 Lexicon
	Lexicon: This should be interesting.  I haven't played by these rules but a couple times, so I wasn't any good at the shortages anyway, though they totally shaped the game.
	Lexicon: My friend group managed to totally misread or make up the rules to this game and didn't realize it for quite a while.  Have to make sure someone else reads the rules next time. ;)
	ts52: Best of luck to you. Feel free to ask me questions and -pass- to get my attention. Then I'll pass back to you.
