andylooney: man, I should not have let you get those 2 yellows. I think I'm going to lose this one.
andylooney: You're already ahead and I can see where this is going, and I'm not happy about it. I'm thinking about just resigning now...

27) Jesse: Sacrifice G3 Clampett

Jesse: I must say, I'm relieved by your response here. I woke up in the middle of the night suddenly worried you would simply move one of your r1s out to littleblue. That would have given you a huge production advantage in red.
Jesse: But you're right; things got harder for you once I got some yellow ships to go with my factory.
