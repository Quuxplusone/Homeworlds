Homeworlds Online (SDG# 16714)
Variants: "No undo, Sinister"
Started: 2010.6.22, Ended: 2010.7.6
Participants: zara2stra (S), goulo (N), AdamBadura (E)
Winner: AdamBadura

1) goulo: Homeworld G3 B2 Y3

2) AdamBadura: Homeworld B1 G2 Y3
	goulo: I'm playing my first game in the Homeworlds Ladder and it turned quite strange/interesting. I killed his 3-ship soon, which I thought would give me a quick win afterwards, but now he has several pesky 1-ships like annoying mosquitoes at my homeworld which I can't capture safely or easily. :)
Join the ladder and we can meta-compete to see who of us can get the highest. :)

3) zara2stra: Homeworld Y3 G1 B3
	AdamBadura: How to join it? How does it work? What is it that ladder?

4) goulo: Build Y1 Goulo
	goulo: See the link "Ladders" at top of page: http://superdupergames.org/?page=ladders
 
Basically you can challenge someone up to 5 positions higher than you, and if you lose, nothing happens, but if you win, you move up to their place.
 
I advise clicking user info to verify that the person is active recently. Some people haven't logged in for months or over a year, so I assume there is no use in challenging them...

5) AdamBadura: Build Y1 Adambadura

6) zara2stra: Build B1 Zara2stra
	AdamBadura: I did.
	goulo: Great! In the forum I requested that a Branches ladder be created, but so far there was no reply. So I am currently in the ladders for Homeworlds, Alien City, and Mirador (a cool abstract 2-player connection game)
	goulo: Sadly we still don't have 6 in the Mirador ladder to activate it. So feel free to check out Mirador and join it if you like the game. :)
	AdamBadura: This system sucks. From 5 available (to challange) players two are already in play (you and the other), two didn't log in for 2 weeks and 1 for over a year.
	goulo: So challenge one of the 2-week people. Or wait a day or so and I'll probably (incredible to me - it's a good lesson!) lose my ladder game soon (where I killed his 3-ship and now I'll probably lose, so weird!!!).

7) goulo: Discover Y1 Goulo G1 Smeraldeto
	zara2stra: Sorry again for the time it took me to get to SDG - I'm having a real hell at where I work

8) AdamBadura: Trade Y1 R1 Adambadura
	goulo: No problem! Good luck with it!

9) zara2stra: Build B1 Zara2stra

10) goulo: Build Y1 Goulo

11) AdamBadura: Build R1 Adambadura
	goulo: By the way, I totally lost that ladder game. Very surprising interesting lesson for me! Killing the enemy 3-ship too early can be fatal if you yourself have to sacrifice too much in the process of killing their 3-ship.

12) zara2stra: Trade B1 R1 Zara2stra
	AdamBadura: I have seen that game (in the logs) and trace it move by move. (It was a quick one.)
 
I don't think that killing 3 ship was to much to early. There was just "bad luck" that you hadn't any R ship in your homeworld and he was able to reach it within a single move (with sacrificing). If you wouldn't destroy his 3 ship the same might have happened.
 
I think you mistake was hope that you will cope with the problem. You were afraid of loosing your 3 ship in a catastrophe so you lost the game instead. You should have acknowledge earlier that your 3 ship is lost and accept catastrophe. (Its not your first time - you already lost in that way with me once.)
 
What I concluded from that game is that in 2 player game it seems extremely important to constantly keep R ship it your homeworld even at the beginning of the game. 2 player games are far more aggressive because there is much less back-watching. With 3 players if I attack my left opponent he will go into defence and make it easier for his left opponent. But his left opponent is my right one and he will use that occasion to press my stronger and so I will have to retreat. The cycle closes. With two players it is far easier.
	AdamBadura: By the way I am now fighting with him/her. I hope I will do better.
 
One catastrophe was already there but I make it better for me (after catastrophe I hade 3,1,1 ships while he had only 3,1 and I had one of those ships in a different system so it was like 2 moves advantage).

13) goulo: Trade Y1 R1 Goulo
	goulo: I also wasted 2 moves at a critical moment after the catastrophe, changing my y3 to r3 and then having to change it back to y3 when he built a 2nd r1. I think I should have instead immediately moved my other y1 to a green world to start building elsewhere.

	AdamBadura: I managed to regain our honour by defeating shmil1.
 
It was an even quicker game than yours (around 20 rounds). We lost 3-size ships quite soon (I put myself in risk of catastrophe but it could be done only by him sacrificing his own 3-size ship so I took my chances and he decided to sacrifice).
 
In general I think he made 3 major mistakes during the game and the last one costed him the game. HE possibly knew that his last action was bad but he was already in such bad possition that all he could count for was either my mistake or his quick and painless death. So I became the Grim Reaper. :)

	AdamBadura: By the way I climbed up 5 steps in the ladder. But in an unsatisfable manner. The game was ended (automatically) because player did not make his setup move after requested time. But I hope people in higher parts of the ladder tend to play more.

	goulo: Yay! I wasn't eliminated! :)
 
Now you should learn Alien City to celebrate your victory...
	AdamBadura: Interesting game. Somewhere in the middle of the game I though I will lose as my position was worse they yours and I had no idea what to do. Then goulo prpared to destroy B star in my system. But this acutally I considered an advantage. It made a direct connection from my system to zara2stra's so I could keep 3-size ships in my system to protect it while being still able to move to zara2stra in a single move.
 
All would be fine if goulo would indeed destroy B. But he waited. And my position was becoming worse as I could build much and zara2stra was nearing goulo's destruction. So I made a B ship in my home worldd to lure goulo. And it worked. I lost B. But it costed goulo one lestt B ship. And it was a B3 ship. So I still could not make the prepared attack because goulo in respons would invide my own system and conquere it faster.
 
So I waited for some mistake or a bit of luck. And after the catastrophes period I come out stronger. It seems to me I lost less the you, or at least less in key positions which I needed to attack zara2stra.
 
Anotherone for me. :) A good one - thanks!
