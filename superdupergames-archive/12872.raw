	zoltar: Well, you did it again -- I'm already lost this early in the opening -- I'm locked out of the reds and I don't see anything I can possibly do.
	TwoShort: Hypothetically, if I saw something I thought you could try, I might decide I was better off not saying anything about it, particularly since I might be missing some obvious reason it couldn't work in any case.  Potentially.
	zoltar: Well, I set up the position and studied it, and I can only conclude my position is hopeless.  I'd rather resign and start over where I have a chance! 
	TwoShort: Fair enough.  I also set up the position and tried to figure out what you should do. The only option I was hinting at as build at greenbelt, sac the y1 to move to a b2, sac the green to build all the remaining blue, sac a b2 to flip the 3 pointers to red and green or yellow.  Everything else I saw for you was doom, I probably could have figured out how to stop that, I just hadn't yet...
 Anyway, that's the first time I've ever tried a red lock-out; I sort of backed into when I didn't see anything else good.
