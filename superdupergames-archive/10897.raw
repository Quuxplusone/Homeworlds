	JJ12121616: I am fairly new to the game. Don't go light on me, though. Might I ask why the red homestar?
	MikeYarrum: No problem. It's something I picked up here from advanced players - it makes it really difficult to attack my homeworld. Combine this with the fact that it will also be difficult to attack later in the game when 1 point pieces will be rare (2 and 3 point homestars).
 
It does put me at a slight disadvantage early in the game, as I have to trade for a yellow ship ASAP. But it tends to pay off later.

8) JJ12121616: Build Y1 Jj12121616

9) MikeYarrum: Build Y2 Mikeyarrum

10) JJ12121616: Build Y2 Jj12121616
	JJ12121616: I understand. Basically I'm going to have to sac Y1's to get to your home. Your going to lock up all the small pieces all over the smalls, and just move a fat attacker out and dominate.
 
I don't mind my setup. I've used it the most. Just make dudes and catastrophes, getting all the 3's to use.
 
This could be interesting. I'll end up locking up the 3's and you locking your home world entirely.
