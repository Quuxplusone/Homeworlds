	Draw5PlayAll: I knew it was bad to blow your B2 star without a plan to take out the Y3, but I had no choice really. I was just hoping that maybe you would mess up and I _would_ get a shot at your Y3.
	ts52: :) Yeah, it's always risky blowing up half a homeworld before you have a plan for the other half. Good game!
	Draw5PlayAll: Was there anything else I could have done?
	ts52: Not sure. At some point I need to spend time studying homeworlds end games.
