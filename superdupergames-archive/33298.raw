	wil: I'll stop it and you can challenge me when available
	wil: Holler I'll.check with babamots...don't wanna spoil the tourney
	Babamots: If you can't play this many games at once, you can pause the game timer by clicking the "Call an Admin" link at the top (I've never seen a site administrator actually respond, so pausing the tier is all it does). I didn't put anything about this in the rules, so I think it's OK as long as you don't pause all your games and slow down the tournament :-).
	wil: I am noe in half a dozen games and just got to play 3 or 4 of them back and fourth turn after turn for 20-30 minutes...it was glorious.
	jeep: I'm okay with playing this. One of my others is a losing battle, so doesn't take much time.
