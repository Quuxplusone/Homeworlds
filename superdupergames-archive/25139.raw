	zoltar: I think I finally have compensation for the extra large ship, though I've been wondering just how many extra smaller ships do I need to make up for a large one. 

39) Aristos: Move R2 Spark Shine
	Aristos: > just how many extra smaller ships do I need 
> to make up for a large one
 
Typically, a lot, though I've never been sure why. I just know that when I've gotten behind with other players, it goes badly, but that could just be a reflection of me playing badly in the first place and then continuing to do so. Correlation does not equal causation. :-)

40) zoltar: Trade G3 Y3 Bluecheese

41) Aristos: Trade R3 G3 Blaze

42) zoltar: Build R3 Blueberry
	zoltar: The best player I know, Andy Looney, said that your side of the game he'd rather play (I showed him the position back when it was your G3 vs my 3 mediums and a small), because the game is about the big ships. One big ship can bully all the rest. Now you let me catch up by letting me get all the greens, so you couldn't move your g3 around without my blowing it up, and when you sacked it, you let me get two big ships as well the next move, so I've equalized now, but if you'd got more greens, I think you could have kept the advantage and pressed it.
	Aristos: I realize that now... I thought that by popping it to pick up more of the red that I'd be able to threaten you the way you were threatening me. 
	Aristos: I've definitely lost that momentum now.

	Aristos: Well done. I see the end. 
	zoltar: Thanks. Interesting that neither one of us ever got a blue piece. I hought about it, but never had the time. At the beginning I had no time to waste stopping you from getting all the yellows, and even so I let you get the extra large piece, and after that it always seemed better to grow new pieces on blue stars rather than get any blue pieces. In fact all the starts I created were blue. And at the end I realized if I could just trade and get yellows I would have a winning attack, so again I didn't need blue, and didn't care if you get the r3 and g3 I was trading in for the Y3s.
