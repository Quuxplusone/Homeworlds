7) tesla: Build Y1 Tesla

8) zoltar: Discover G1 Zoltar B2 Blueridge
	zoltar: btw, moving your 3-sized piece away from your homeworld is very dangerous. The reason is that if I move a 3-sized ship into your homeworld, you cannot capture it, even if you have red ships there, unless you have a 3-sized ship in your homeworld defending.  So later in the game, having an opponent get a large ship into your homeworld which you cannot capture usually is fatal. In this case, I can't do anything for several moves, but when I get some pieces built and moved out,  you will have to waste a move moving your Y3 back, unless you can quickly build another 3-sized ship there before I can threaten to move a big piece in.

20) zoltar: Attack Y1 Tesla

	tesla: ok, I think we finished the game
	zoltar: I sacrificed my Y2, and that sacrifice gives me two yellow powers, or two moves.  If I sacrificed my G3, I could then make three grows at once.  That's why I was saying that you had to return your 3-sized ship to your homeworld before I build some ships.  Moving your Y3 out was terrible, and every move after that, moving your Y3 (or R3) back would have been the best move.
