21) Babamots: Trade Y3 G3 Babamots
	Babamots: I think yellow is the worst to get frozen out of. Then red, green, and blue. It's not usually too hard to go a whole game without getting any blue ships (unless you end up needing them for a home catastrophe).

	Babamots: If you trade a ship at your home for a green, it will take me one extra turn to fire my weapon.
	Babamots: If you trade for green and I charge ahead with my plan, when our homes become connected, you could cause a green catastrophe at my home. I'll need an extra turn to avoid that.
