Variants: "Sinister"
Started: 2005.11.20, Ended: 2005.11.28
Participants: Personman (S), Jesse (N)
Winner: Jesse

1) Jesse: Homeworld B1 G2 Y3
	Personman: I accepted this challenge without knowing what sinister is, so I'm hoping i don't regret it :) oddly, the rules for this option are not in the wiki or on the wunderland page. I am about to go google it, but if i find nothing i will be wanting to know what it is...
	Personman: oh. um, correct me if i'm wrong, but isn't sinister entirely irrelevant in a two player game
	Jesse: Yeah, there's no functional difference between regular and sinister two-player homeworlds.  I was just feeling a little evil when I set up the game.  Also, I was curious whether the system would allow it.

2) Personman: Homeworld B3 G1 Y3
	Jesse: Here's a tip: If you want a brief description of the game variants, you can click on "New Challenge" on the challenges page.  The new challenge page always has a brief description of each variant.
	Jesse: So, have you played Homeworlds other than a couple of games on this server?
	Personman: nope! but I've played it a couple times on the server, and I love it so far. If I'm ever in the same room with other gamers and an icehouse set, i'll probably make them play it.

3) Jesse: Build Y1 Jesse

4) Personman: Build Y1 Personman
	Jesse: Okay, I'll try to teach you a thing or two while we play.  Let me know if there's anything you're unsure about.

5) Jesse: Discover Y1 Jesse G3 Fresh

6) Personman: Build Y1 Personman

7) Jesse: Build Y2 Jesse
	Jesse: That's not so good, because it gives me the first shot at a medium.

8) Personman: Discover Y1 Personman G2 Tazenda

9) Jesse: Trade Y2 G2 Jesse

10) Personman: Build Y2 Tazenda

11) Jesse: Build Y2 Jesse

12) Personman: Trade Y1 B1 Personman
	Jesse: Be careful, you don't want to build right now.  I can fly the y1 at Fresh into either Tazenda or (with a sacrifice) your homeworld.

13) Jesse: Trade Y2 R2 Jesse
	Jesse: Good choice.

14) Personman: Move B1 Personman Tazenda
	Jesse: You usually don't want to wait too long after your opponent takes red before you get into red yourself, though you're not in immediate danger this turn.

15) Jesse: Discover G2 Jesse Y3 Belly

16) Personman: Trade Y2 R2 Tazenda

17) Jesse: Build G1 Belly

18) Personman: Build R1 Tazenda

19) Jesse: Build G1 Belly

20) Personman: Move R2 Tazenda Belly
	Jesse: You have the advantage in red and blue right now, but I'm hoping to make up for that in the long run by freezing you out of green ships.

21) Jesse: Sacrifice R2 Jesse
Attack R2 Belly
Pass
	Personman: Just so you know, I'm not saying anything because i have nothing to say, not because i'm ignoring you. I apprecaite the advice a lot, especially coming *after* my moves as it does. It's a good way to learn. Thanks a lot. 
	Jesse: Great, glad to help!
	Jesse: Don't forget that I can sacrifice my r2 to attack.  It's not ideal here, since there's only one ship I can nab, but I have no problem sacrificing an r2 to take an r2.

22) Personman: Build B1 Tazenda

23) Jesse: Discover G2 Belly B2 Bork

24) Personman: Build B2 Tazenda
	Jesse: I'm thinking about building g3s and swapping them out for b3s to really mess up your plans, but I'm not sure I can do that successfully.  There's a danger of you sending over blues to destroy Bork itself.  Another possibility would be to just build the two g3s and send them into your home system to blast you.

25) Jesse: Build G3 Bork

26) Personman: Trade Y3 G3 Personman

27) Jesse: Sacrifice G3 Bork
Build G3 Bork
Build Y1 Fresh
Build Y2 Jesse
	Jesse: There is a significant danger to switching to a green ship like that.  It's your only ship in the system, and it's the same color as one of the system markers.  I could sacrifice a y2 or y3 to send two green ships in to blast you, except that the only one I have is also the only ship in my own home system.

28) Personman: Trade G3 R3 Personman
	Jesse: This maneuver is called the factory, since it allows you to build ships much faster than normal.  Unfortunately for you, it takes two green ships, or you won't be able to rebuild the g3.
	Jesse: Also, note that it's not possible for me to blast your homeworld without abandoning my own, so you need to defend by either changing the g3 to another color, or recalling a red, blue, or yelow ship from Tazenda.

29) Jesse: Build G3 Bork
	Jesse: Heh, excuse me.  I meant "it's now possible", not "it's not possible".  I suppose you probably figured that out, but it's best to be clear.

30) Personman: Build Y2 Tazenda
	Personman: yeah, i noticed that. :)

	Jesse: Since you don't have any green ships, I'm fairly safe doing this.  I have two large ships within range of your homeworld, and could put them both in there at the same time using a y2 sacrifice.  Think about how you might defend yourself against that.

31) Jesse: Build R1 Belly
	Jesse: One defense against attackers is to attack them and make them your own.  But with two of them in your system, simply attacking one of them would leave the other free to capture two ships with an r2 sacrifice.  If you had an r2 to sacrifice, you could capture both g3s at once, so I would be very cautious about sending them in.
	Jesse: The other way is to destroy them by causing a catastrophe.  In this case, that isn't possible because you don't have any green ships, and there aren't any available for you to switch any of your ships.  Besides, that would destroy half of your system anyway, and presumably you don't want that.
	Jesse: Okay, since you've already moved, I'm going to go a little easy on you right now to give you some more time to process it.

32) Personman: Trade Y2 R2 Tazenda
	Jesse: (The things I'm *not* doing here are using my factory, switching a g3 for a y3 or a b3, invading your homeworld, and spreading out my yellows so I can build that y3 as soon as you build the y2.)

33) Jesse: Move Y1 Fresh Bork
	Jesse: Yeah, that will be safer.

34) Personman: Move B1 Tazenda Fresh
	Jesse: So, now I'm spreading out my yellows, as well as giving my g3s more mobility.

35) Jesse: Sacrifice R1 Belly
Attack B1 Fresh

36) Personman: Discover B2 Tazenda Y3 Toosk
	Jesse: Now I have a blue, though it's debatable whether it was worth sacrificing my r1 to get it.

37) Jesse: Trade G2 R2 Bork
	Jesse: Good choice!

38) Personman: Discover B2 Toosk G2 Plover

39) Jesse: Trade G3 Y3 Bork
	Jesse: Ooh, another good choice!

40) Personman: Build B2 Plover

41) Jesse: Build G3 Bork

42) Personman: Trade B2 Y2 Plover

43) Jesse: Sacrifice Y3 Jesse
Move G3 Bork Personman
Move G3 Bork Personman
Move Y3 Bork Personman
	Jesse: I should point out that with me having three large ships on your doorstep now, you're in a very dangerous position.  If I send them all in at once, you won't be able to capture them all in one turn.  You could really use another large ship at home, or another r3 anywhere that you could sacrifice.  Unfortunately, it's very hard for you to get them, right now.  You're pretty well on the ropes facing four against one large ships.
	Jesse: In fact, I think sending my ships in now is a finishing blow.  There doesn't seem to be much point in dragging this out, so I'll go ahead and do it.  Let me just say you've played well without any direction these last few turns, you were just in a very difficult situation.  I think the main lesson of this game may be this: Be wary of your opponent freezing you out of ships of any given color.  Once I got ahead in green, and built a factory, I had much better production capacity which allowed me to get ahead with other things as well.  Except blue.  Making a run on blue ships was a good idea, but you don't want to do it at the expense of being frozen out of something else.

44) Personman: Sacrifice R2 Tazenda
Attack G3 Personman
Attack Y3 Personman

45) Jesse: Sacrifice R2 Belly
Attack R3 Personman
Attack Y3 Personman
	Jesse: Right, that's your best delay tactic.

	Personman: Alrighties. Well, I can see my doom quite clearly at this point, so I won't make us go through the motions. Thanks for a great game and advice. Perhaps we shall play again someday. 
	SYSTEM: Personman resigns.
