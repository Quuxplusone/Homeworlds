19) dlwillson: T B2 R2 Dlwillson

	Felix: Great move! I knew that attack was doomed to fail.

35) dlwillson: D B1 Nicetry G2 Field
	dlwillson: Good game so far! Fun and fast!
	dlwillson: That was a really good attack. It cost me a lot to escape.

36) Felix: Attack B1 Forest
	Felix: Thank you. I do like to keep the pressure on whenever possible, because I have found that if I let it become a resource management game (that is, a game dominated mostly by fleet building and denying pieces to the opponent), I usually lose. My hope is that pressuring the opponent to make rash decisions (or even better, choose between 2 potential threats) and hopefully make a mistake :)
	Felix: This has definitely been a fun one!
	Draw5PlayAll: "My hope is that pressuring the opponent to make rash decisions... and hopefully make a mistake" is awkwardly written.

37) dlwillson: Build B2 Nicetry
	Felix: "My hope is that pressuring the opponent to make rash decisions will cause him or her to make a mistake."
	Felix: "My hope is that pressuring the opponent to make rash decisions will cause him or her to make a mistake."

	dlwillson: I think you're one short of a win, but I guess we'll see.

44) Felix: Trade Y2 G2 Felix
	Felix: I think you're right, but it will be fun either way :)

	Felix: Hold on, I just thought of something. Let me make sure I want to do that :P

45) dlwillson: B B1 Dlwillson
	Felix: Heck, let's try something even more fun...

46) Felix: Build Y2 Felix
	dlwillson: I may have been mistaken. :-)

47) dlwillson: Trade G1 R1 Dlwillson

48) Felix: Move Y1 Felix Lapiz
	Felix: That's not at all what I expected (and secretly hoped) you'd do! And sorry to keep undoing. That time I typed in the wrong color!
	Felix: And nice use of the catastrophe during the turn instead of at the end. I'm so glad they opened up that feature, since it adds so much strategic depth. I often secretly hope that my opponent doesn't realize it's an option ;)

49) dlwillson: B B2 Dlwillson

50) Felix: Discover Y1 Felix B3 Soak

51) dlwillson: B B3 Nicetry
	dlwillson: There's another thing that's a surprise. Home systems can be completely abandoned mid-turn without returning to the bank. You still have to be back by the end of the turn, though.
	dlwillson: I didn't do that this game, obviously. I did it in another game.

52) Felix: Build G1 Felix
	dlwillson: Sorry about that. I suddenly realized I'd put myself in checkmate.
	Felix: Oh, interesting! I knew that was possible in the real game rules, but I didn't know it was implemented on here. I haven't had a situation yet where that's necessary, but I can see how it could be in a pinch. Thanks for the tip ;)
	Felix: And I honestly never have a problem with undoing if you catch yourself and want to change it before I make my next move 
	Felix: Although in this case I would have preferred you to make the mistake :P

53) dlwillson: T B3 Y3 Nicetry

54) Felix: Sacrifice Y2 Felix
Move Y1 Soak Dlwillson
Move Y1 Lapiz Dlwillson

55) dlwillson: M Y3 Nicetry Felix
	dlwillson: It seems like a bug to me. Where do you see it in the real rules?
	Felix: There's a line about it in the Andy Looney rules and also in the version on John Cooper's website.
 
Looney rules: " It's OK to temporarily abandon your Homeworld as long as you have a ship there again by the time your turn is over."
 
Cooper rules: "You may temporarily abandon your Homeworld during your turn, as long as you own at least one ship in it at the end of your turn."

56) Felix: Sacrifice G1 Felix
Build Y2 Dlwillson
Catastrophe Dlwillson Yellow
	dlwillson: Huh. I've seen that rule, but I just now realized that I've been assuming that someone else needs to have a ship in the system to hold it down.

	Felix: Thank you! I was scared you'd notice the threat and trade for an R2 during one of the last few turns. That was a very fun and interesting game, especially when we both had zero large ships. I look forward to the next!
	dlwillson: Meanwhile I was scared you'd get a blue and go bowling.
	Felix: There were several ways I could have kept you on the wrong footing, I suppose. As ill conceived as my earlier attack was, it all worked out in the end :) I honestly hadn't planned beyond the initial attack.
