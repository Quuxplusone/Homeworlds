	Draw5PlayAll: For the record, I think tournament game clocks have to be 7/2/7 but ladder games are 3/3/10, so a game cannot really be both at once...

	Laurie_Menke: Sorry... forgot what I was doing for a minute...

	bhorner: No worries, that's why the option is there.  :)
	Laurie_Menke: ::sigh::  I'm sorry, bhorner. I know that's not how you wanted to win. I had really hoped to finish this game before going off grid for 10 days for Burning Man, but the week before that got extremely busy and I didn't even have time to warn you I'd be gone. I'm extremely sorry. :(
	bhorner: Oh burning man, that's cool!
No worries, it happens, we'll play in the tournament later.  :)
	Laurie_Menke: :) Thank you!
