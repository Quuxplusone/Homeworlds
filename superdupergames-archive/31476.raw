Homeworlds Online (SDG# 31476)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2017.2.20, Ended: 2017.3.19
Participants: Draw5PlayAll (S), bhorner (N)
Winner: bhorner

1) bhorner: Homeworld Y1 B1 G3 *

2) Draw5PlayAll: Homeworld B3 Y3 G3 *
	bhorner: Here we go.  Planning on repeated sacs of g3, to speed it up, we should help each other keep the. Available in the bank.  Also, probably won't want to do this again, so I made small small to get all the biggest into a single system elsewhere...  Maybe we should do it in one our homes?  You could go big big to make it more crowded.  :)
	Draw5PlayAll: Homeworld systems accept up to 16 ships and peripherals accept 24. We should first pile everything into the homeworlds and then try the peripheral systems.

3) bhorner: Build G1 Bhorner
	bhorner: How did you find out about the limits?  Those aren't part of the game... just this implementation?  Is the code open source or something?

4) Draw5PlayAll: Build G1 Draw5playall

5) bhorner: Build G1 Bhorner
	Draw5PlayAll: Also, for extra fun, let us at the end try to make us both lose at once.
	bhorner: Yes, and also at some point try for a catastrophe of all pieces of a single color.  (Or 2 in one turn even...?)

	bhorner: They're filling the border, that's probably not random.
	bhorner: OK, 16 for the outer ring, and it must be 8 for an inner ring.  We should put all the bugs in yours sincerely you have big big.
	Draw5PlayAll: "The ship could not be moved" when I tried to invade your homeworld.
	Draw5PlayAll: Please move one blue into my homeworld, unless you want to try to do something else.
 
I believe that homeworld systems reserve the inner 9 squares of the 5x5 grid for the stars. It seems like they could use less space, especially after 1 star dies, but then again the highest amount of ships that could "safely" enter a system is 11 (3 of each color, but one is the star.)

	Draw5PlayAll: I intend to end this game with both homeworld systems destroyed.
	bhorner: That sounds like a good idea, but first, I'd like to fill your homeworld with bigs, and then mediums until it's full, and see what happens when no more will fit.  Then I'd like to do the same with a non-homeworld...  are you on board with that?
	Draw5PlayAll: Sure, let us flood a peripheral system. Call it something nice and simple.
	Draw5PlayAll: I noticed that the positions of the stars keep changing. Sometimes they are diagonal, sometimes orthogonal...

25) bhorner:
Build G3 Draw5playall

26) Draw5PlayAll: Pass
	bhorner: I missed some of your comments before my last move, that's what I get for playing on my phone.  I also noticed the stars orientation changing.  I bet that when a single star is left, the inner ring of 8 can also be filled, like a non-homeworld.

31) bhorner: Build G3 Draw5playall
	bhorner: If you want to help me fill your homeworld with all the bugs, that would make it go faster, then we can flood a secondary system (I vote small system).  I was just thinking, I don't think both players can die at once, it would be against the rules to call the killing catastrophe on yourself...
	Draw5PlayAll: I saw a white ship for a second... probably a blur of the Y2 and B2.

32) Draw5PlayAll: Build R1 Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: I vote medium.
	bhorner: Hm, an impasse...  Just kidding, I don't really care.  :)

54) Draw5PlayAll: Build Y2... R2
	bhorner: Since we can't kill both players at once, I vote we kill as many pips at once as possible in a single turn.  This would mean filling the r2 system with all the bigs, then all the mediums, then smalls for whatever room is left.  I assume this would leave at least 4 of each color there.  Then in one turn you could call catastrophes on all 4 colors in a single system (I guess for full glory, you'd want to save the color of the system itself for last).
	Draw5PlayAll: I want to try to kill both at once.

55) bhorner: Sac Y2 Bhorner

	Draw5PlayAll: It let me lose as long as I did not eliminate you.
	bhorner: Oh, nice.  That's actually against the rules but I imagine it doesn't come up in standard play much.  :). That was interesting, thanks!
	Draw5PlayAll: It is within the rules to annihilate both players (creating a tie) but not to self-destruct. On SDG it is the opposite!
	bhorner: "You are never allowed to take an action or trigger a catastrophe that causes you to own no ships in your Homeworld at the end of 
your turn."
	bhorner: That's from the 2nd to last paragraph of this:
http://superdupergames.org/rules/homeworlds.pdf
	Draw5PlayAll: ...but Andy said you can cause a tie, in some BoardGameGeek page. The Homeworlds rules are sort of messed up, with at least 4 different sources (Playing with Pyramids, your link, Pyramid Arcade, and SDG's rules from ginohn.com)
	Draw5PlayAll: Wait, your link was SDG's / John Cooper's. I meant www.looneylabs.com/rules/homeworlds
	bhorner: Oh no, pyramid arcade is yet different?  I just got that, and have all the print (and electronic) versions I'm aware of.
	Draw5PlayAll: Well, I know Arcade has more content... not sure if there is any functional difference.
