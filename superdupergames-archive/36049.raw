	Babamots: GG! Thanks for the game!
	Draw5PlayAll: I guess my biggest mistake was letting you blow up my R3?
	Babamots: Losing your R3 was important because it gave me a large-ship advantage, but it was never convenient for me to actually invade your colonies with a large. I think your lack of red ships in the last half of the game was a bigger problem. My final invasion wouldn't have worked if you had had an r2 ship anywhere. Trading y2 for r2 on your 13th move would have been pretty good.
	Draw5PlayAll: I never understand how it is not convenient for the opponent to simply send an R3 in and force me to sacrifice a medium to scatter my other pieces.
	Babamots: It might have been better for me to move my r3 from Risa to earth (on my 14th move for example), but 1) I was worried about you getting too far ahead on yellows and 2) I was hoping that you would present me with an even more attractive target (more ships in one system, preferably without yellow). I think I was also worried about my r3 being stranded on earth and needing an extra turn or sacrifice to turn it back into an active threat.
