JimTarnung: It's my first game of Homeworlds. I hope i don't suck too hard. I'm quite sure that I understand the rules, as I translated them to German.

7) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

8) JimTarnung: Build Y1 Jimtarnung

9) TwoShort: Discover G1 Twoshort B2 Bluonia

10) JimTarnung: Trade Y1 R1 Jimtarnung
TwoShort: I usually try to give new players a few strategy pointers, but be aware that by the time I figure out what pointers to give, it's usually to late to use them :) For example, I'd generally reccomend starting with a green ship.

11) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

12) JimTarnung: Build Y1 Jimtarnung
JimTarnung: Sacrificing a big green surely seems very powerful. I guess I'll learn by doing. Don't hesitate to give advice as you see fit. Even if it is to late..

13) TwoShort: Build G2 Bluonia
TwoShort: Well, as far as too late advice... don't take a red before there is any threat of your using it. It's not hurting you, but you could have done something better with that turn.

14) JimTarnung: Trade Y3 G3 Jimtarnung
TwoShort: "The Factory" - sacrificing a g3 to grow 3 ships including a replacement g3, is definitely a key tactic. If your opponent gets that set up and you don't, you'll have a big problem.

15) TwoShort: Sacrifice G3 Twoshort
Build G2 Twoshort
Build G3 Bluonia
Build G3 Twoshort
TwoShort: That will get you a factory, but note that it's only safe because I can't get a green to your Homeworld for a catastrophe. If I took a y2, you'd need to move a green out, and wouldn't be able to use the factory without moving your 3 out.
TwoShort: But for this turn at least,I'm more interested in using the factory myself...

16) JimTarnung: Build Y1 Jimtarnung
JimTarnung: Oh no! I didn't realise that you can rebuild the ship you just sacrificed. I traded for a big green to avoid that you get two big ones in one turn. Well, I learned something new again..

17) TwoShort: Trade G3 Y3 Bluonia
TwoShort: Yes, sacrificed ships go tot the stash imediately. The same is true of abandoned system markers; so if you sacrifice a green that was alone at a star, you can grow the star as a ship.

18) JimTarnung: Discover G1 Jimtarnung Y3 Yello

19) TwoShort: Trade G2 R2 Bluonia

20) JimTarnung: Build Y2 Jimtarnung

21) TwoShort: Discover G2 Twoshort B2 Blitzen
JimTarnung: Yellow catastrophe? Are you willing to do it?

22) JimTarnung: Trade Y1 B1 Jimtarnung

23) TwoShort: Sacrifice G3 Twoshort
Build G2 Bluonia
Build G3 Blitzen
Build G3 Twoshort
TwoShort: The yellow catastrophe would have cost me a y3 & y1 for your y2 and 2 y1s, which I'd rate as a big loss for me. My super-crude rule of thumb is a 2-point is worth 3 1-points, and a 3-point is worth 3 2-points. So I'll pretty much never give up a 3 without getting one in return.

24) JimTarnung: Move B1 Jimtarnung Yello

JimTarnung: Thank you too. I learned a few basic moves, but there's a long way to go. This won't be my last time playing..
