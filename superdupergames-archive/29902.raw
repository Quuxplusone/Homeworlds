	Felix: Hey there! First game? Hope you have fun and let me know if you have questions!

4) Felix: Build Y1 Felix
	Skully: Oh hey. It actually is my first game. Hopefully i wont make it to easy for ya :)  
	Skully: To be sure, the only way to get the bigger size ships is if there arent any smaller ones left, correct?
	Felix: Hey, no worries. I'm happy to help you learn the game, but I won't take it TOO easy on you. The best way to learn is to make mistakes against a better player. That's how I learned and am still learning!
 
And yep, you're right. You cannot build a bigger ship until the smaller ones are all used up. You also can ONLY build a ship of a color you already own in that system. You cannot use the star's color(s) when doing this, but you can only use a ship color you already own. For instance, I can ONLY build yellow in my home system right now, not green or red until I trade for one of those colors (but I have no blue, so that will be tricky!)

	Felix: I just need to try to get a blue ships somehow

	Skully: Haha yeah  i know tryed to stop you but cant now.  Well played. I had heard the majority of players use blue and red as thier stars. Or atleast have blue and red in the mix between ship and stars. I personally hate when people implament a metta,  so i sat down and came up wit my combo to use against the Meta. To my suprise i find your combo, is this an experamentle  game for you?

20) Felix: Trade Y2 R2 Rim
	Felix: Interesting. Yes, some top players incorporate red and blue into their home stars. My preference is usually to use a yellow and blue star with a green starting ship. Yeah, this is a bit of an experimental game for me. I'd be happy to try another with my traditional starting colors, though!

	Skully: I'd be happy to accept that challange once this match is over. Im glad to see that in my very first Home World match im playing against a non meta player. I have the feeling that we'll  be playing against each other many times. :)
	Felix: Sounds good to me! I have a few games under my belt, so I know some things, but I am definitely not a meta player haha. I'd rather have fun than crush everyone around me :P
