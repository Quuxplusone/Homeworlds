1) benji_stein: Homeworld Y3 B1 G3
	benji_stein: I'm not terribly experienced with homeworlds, but It's fun, and I'd like to get better. Feel free to point out my mistakes, so I can learn from them.

2) MatrixFrog: Homeworld G3 B2 Y3
	MatrixFrog: Sure. There seems to be a sudden influx of new Homeworlds players lately. It's great!

3) benji_stein: Build G1 Benji_stein

4) MatrixFrog: Build Y1 Matrixfrog

5) benji_stein: Build G1 Benji_stein
	benji_stein: Yeah. I love that I can play people online, instead of struggling to find others irl. Though it does make it a slower game.  

6) MatrixFrog: Build Y1 Matrixfrog
	MatrixFrog: It's also harder to keep track of multi-move plans. That's what the notebook is for, but it's just not the same.

7) benji_stein: Trade G1 Y1 Benji_stein

8) MatrixFrog: Trade Y1 B1 Matrixfrog

15) benji_stein: Move Y1 Benji_stein Upchuck

16) MatrixFrog: Build Y2 Beta
	MatrixFrog: You now have three yellow ships in your homeworld, and I have one only a step away from it. You probably didn't notice it moved because it's in the same place on the screen. Make sure you read the log if it's not obvious what happened.
	benji_stein: Wow. You're right. I'm not sure how I missed that - possibly I thought I had a 3/2 system as in a different game I'm playing. But it's still pretty bad of me to not notice. I'm guessing you've not moved yourself to let me undo it. Thanks!

Build G1 Hurl
Build G3 Benji_stein
Build G3 Hurl
	MatrixFrog: The system you've just created is not connected to anyone's homeworld. I guess this makes it a fairly safe place, but it will take two moves to get from it to my homeworld, or from your homeworld to it. Just checking...
	benji_stein: I realize, but thanks. I wanted to move to a new location, and wanted blue, which meant I either had to move to a b3, or move out my second-to-last ship in my homeworld to get to a b2. I suppose I could take an extra turn to get to it, but I thought I'd try it this way. Plus, it might be a good out-of-the-way place to store some ships to sacrifice.
	MatrixFrog: Okay that makes sense.

Catastrophe Matrixfrog B
	benji_stein: Can I ask what you're threatening here?
If it was to catastrophe yellow, you could have done that last turn instead of building the green. If it's green, you're destroying more ships of yours than mine. You have to sacrifice too much to destroy upchuck, and otherwise I'm not seeing it.
I can think of a variety of moves that could be useful, but I want to make sure I'm not missing something...
	MatrixFrog: I guess I didn't totally think it through... the advantage of a green catastrophe is that you have no green ships, so in order to build anything new will require an extra turn. It's probably not worth it, but I'll stick with it and see how it goes.
	benji_stein: I have a bunch of green ships in other systems, though. In fact, one of the moves I was considering was sacrificing my g3, rebuilding it, and causing the catastrophe myself, to prevent your doing the yellow one. I'll wait and let you undo it, if you'd like, since you let me undo a mistake of mine when you pointed it out. Your call.
	MatrixFrog: Okay, good point. Thanks.

	benji_stein: I guess you missed my blue ship in hurl threatening your homeworld. :(
	benji_stein: Good game. Care for another?
