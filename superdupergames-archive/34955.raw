	Draw5PlayAll: Psst psst lock felix out of red psst psst

20) Felix: Discover G1 Felix B1 Out
	Babamots: Early game "lockouts" don't usually scare me anymore. It seems like it's usually safe to trade your large for the color you're lacking and then build more.

21) Draw5PlayAll: Build R2 Draw5playall
	ts52: Nothing person, seems my choice was either take the red or get locked out of the red.

Build Y3 Babamots
Build Y3 Andoria
Build R2 Andoria
	Draw5PlayAll: What? I thought you used it as a blue!
	Draw5PlayAll: For that matter, why have I seen you use Wolf359 as a yellow when red makes more sense to me?

39) ts52: Move Y1 Ts52 Grover
	Draw5PlayAll: IMCAC Babamots gets a Y3 and then the other two probably trade out their lesser yellows to slow the Y3 rush.

40) Felix: Build Y3 Felix
	Babamots: Iconia is where they found the Star Trek equivalent of a stargate. Since it allows instant travel to far-flung places, it seems like a yellow world to me.
	Draw5PlayAll: Well, I could not think of any other blue Trek systems.
	Draw5PlayAll: Game 31346, you discovered Iconia as a blue.
	Babamots: I must not have cared about matching much that day. Ya got me.
For blues, I usually prefer Andoria or Bolarus. Both of their native races are blue-skinned.

41) Draw5PlayAll: Build Y3 Draw5playall

	Babamots: I remembered you asking for "no spoilers" before, but I supposed that meant you hadn't seen much of any series. I'm a TNG man myself. I've forgotten lots of what happens in the other series.

	Draw5PlayAll: Denied!
 
Actually, I should have made Felix lose first, out of revenge for destroying ts52 prematurely.
