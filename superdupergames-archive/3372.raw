Homeworlds Online (SDG# 3372)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2006.5.4, Ended: 2006.5.18
Participants: GeepaMoogle (S), TwoShort (N)
Winner: TwoShort

1) TwoShort: Homeworld Y1 B2 G3
	TwoShort: I figure it's more fun this way; I enjoy expounding on my homeworlds strategy theories, and the game could use more players, so I'd like to help you out, but in a rated game I don't want to help so much that I might lose...
	TwoShort: Anyway, lesson 1: Homeworld selection.  As first player, unless I'm trying a wacky experiment, I'll always go with y1 b2 g3.  Others like g1 b2 y3.  Either a yellow or green ship is reasonable, but I think the green is more straightforward.  You certainly want access to blue, so thats one star, and the other star is whichever of green/yellow you didn't take for the ship.  (As noted in our last game, I'm toying with the other-star-red theory, which is a fine example of the fact that strategies in this game are still in a pretty early stage of evolution, so don't take anything I say as gospel)

2) GeepaMoogle: Homeworld G3 B1 Y3
	TwoShort: So, as second player, the same advice holds, except that you presumably want to use different size stars than me, typically a 1 and a 3.  The thing to consider in star-size selection is what you'll be moving to.  Moving to 3s is nice because it makes it a bit easier to influence the availability of 3s in the stash.  Moving to 1s is not as nice, because they'll be gone fairly quickly and limit your options.
	GeepaMoogle: I knew there was some reason why 2/3 homeworlds weren't often used in Binary Homeworlds.

3) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

4) GeepaMoogle: Build Y1 Geepamoogle
	GeepaMoogle: We'll try starting with mobility this time.  Is there any advice on whether or not to match an exact piece in color/size combo?
	TwoShort: Not really; besides getting access to the colors you want, and having the two sizes you want, the only other consideration is what's left in the stash.  If you drain the little guys of a particular color, it will make getting to the bigger ones slightly easier, which might be good for your oponent (if you had taken a small green for example) 

5) TwoShort: Trade G1 Y1 Twoshort
	TwoShort: Stash management is really what much of the strategy is about.  Here in the early game, we'll be building a buch of small stuff, but mainly jockeying for the chance to build the bigger stuff.  If you build the last 1 pointer of a color, I'll get first chance to build 2 pointers, and so again with 3 pointers.  Before long we'll rip through one or more colors (most likely green and/or yellow) and at that point we both want to be the guy with more three pointers, or a monopoly on a color (particularly yellow).

6) GeepaMoogle: Build Y2 Geepamoogle

7) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort

8) GeepaMoogle: Trade Y2 G2 Geepamoogle
	GeepaMoogle: Was gonna do a trade for green to deny you a y2, but then I figured this way I get a y2 before I clear possible catastrophe in yellow.  Besides, either way next move is likely a swap for green.
	TwoShort: Yeah, the common way to lock the other guy out of a color is to take all the one points before he gets either that color or access to two points.  So that's probably not going to happen to either of us.

9) TwoShort: Discover Y1 Twoshort G3 Grogar
	TwoShort: A couple stratagems to be aware of-  
The Factory: If green is sufficiently depleted one can sacrifice my G3, grow twice, and re-grow the same G3 I sacrificed.  Technically, one can do this if there are two g2s left assuming one has room to grow that much green without a catastrophe.  Practically, I won't do it if it just leaves another G3 available for you to take.
The Investment: in this strategem, one moves a green to a Y3 system.  The other guy won't be able to get that y3 as a ship.  After all the yellow is gone, if that green is still alone at the system, you can "cash in" by sacrificeing the green, and growing the Y3.

10) GeepaMoogle: Build Y2 Geepamoogle

11) TwoShort: Build Y2 Grogar
	GeepaMoogle: Denying me a large mobile facoty, eh?

12) GeepaMoogle: Discover Y2 Geepamoogle B2 Alpha
	GeepaMoogle: Well, my thoughts are that I can use the yellow to get to another medium green.  Still not sure how to combat a factory.
	GeepaMoogle: Btw, been thinking of possible types of pieces that might be intersting..  Came up with 3 possiblilities.
 
1) Summon - Allows any ship in the system to summon any of their other ships of equal or lesser size to their side.  Potentially useful as a homeworld color, and may reduce the need for yellow (although yellow are still needed to discover and invade)
 
2) Explosives - Any ship in the system will self-destruct if captured, rather than converted.  When sacrificed, it gives 1 use per size, reduced by 1 each turn.
 
3) Stealth - Allows the use of any enemy technology in the system.  Of limited use as prolonged contact between any two sides tends to be short-lived.
 
Not sure how these would work out in actual play, but they could present some interesting possiblities.
	GeepaMoogle: Forgot to clarify.  Ship abilities can only be used by the owner.  Planet abilities could be used by anyone in the system.

13) TwoShort: Discover G1 Twoshort Y3 Yolonda

14) GeepaMoogle: Discover Y1 Geepamoogle B2 Beta
	TwoShort: Combatting a factory is tough short of having your own, which is one reason I like to play green :)  Come to think of it, it might be a reason not to start with a G3 in your homeworld.  But mostly with yellow you want to threaten catastrophes.  By sacrificeing a big yellow you can leap way across the galaxy, or move several ships all at once.  Not that you'll actually do it, but you'll constrain my options with the threat of it.  Note for example, that I can't grow in either of my systems this turn.

15) TwoShort: Discover Y1 Grogar G2 Gobble
	TwoShort: Note though, that while my having a factory might be a factor later, I can't use until those little greens are gone from the stash.  At best I could deplete in four turns, which is a long time, especially considering the only thing I'm focussed on for the next few turns is who gets the yellow 3 pointers.  (We each get one if neither of us sees a better move than I currently do)
	GeepaMoogle: Hmmm, choices..  Send the small yellow to a new b2 planet perhaps?  That would allow me some space to try and snatch the yellow, then try to build some greens afterward
	TwoShort: That's what I imagined you would do.  THen you're ready to grow that y3 if I take the y2, or even sacrtifice the g2 to grow both Ys.  I'll presumably split up my yellows next turn so I can cash in my investment at Yolonda once you take the yellows.  

16) GeepaMoogle: Build Y2 Geepamoogle

17) TwoShort: Build Y3 Gobble
	GeepaMoogle: And now a moment of truth.  I would sacrifice the green for yellow, but I have yellow covered well ehough, and need green more.  It isn't safe to spawn another at HQ, since there's a green at Yolanda in range.  Possibilities to look at.  {1} Shift the green to a safer spot.  {2} Go ahead and spawn a yellow to change into another color later, giving up the second y3

18) GeepaMoogle: Move Y2 Geepamoogle Beta
	TwoShort: Well, I think you should have sacrificed, and traded the y2 at aplpha for a g2 next turn.  3 pointers are just that valuable.  It's true that getting locked out of a color makes things difficult, but if that color isn't yellow it's not disasterous all by itself.

19) TwoShort: Sacrifice G1 Yolonda
Build Y3 Grogar
	TwoShort: So now I'll note that unless you move/trade one of those yellows, I could cause a yellow disaster in your homeworld.  Expensively for me, but if there is any move that leaves me with a 3 point, and you with none, I'll almost certainly do it.

20) GeepaMoogle: Sacrifice Y2 Alpha
Move Y2 Beta Grogar
Move Y1 Beta Grogar
Catastrophe Grogar Yellow

21) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort
	GeepaMoogle: I could take out Grogar, and lose Alhpa and Beta..  The result would be you'd be ahead, but it might mean I gain ground, and ruin whatever plans you might have.

22) GeepaMoogle: Discover G2 Geepamoogle B2 Alpha

23) TwoShort: Build G1 Twoshort
	GeepaMoogle: Almost forgot to trigger catastrophe

24) GeepaMoogle: Build Y1 Geepamoogle
	TwoShort: You lost two y2s and a y1 to take out my y3 and y2; definitely worth it from a material standpoint.  The downside is, catastrophes tend to simplify the game, which tends to favor the leader.  Still, I think it was the thing to do.

25) TwoShort: Discover G1 Twoshort B3 Bluestar
	GeepaMoogle: Well, it gives me a bit of a chance to try and regroup.

26) GeepaMoogle: Build G1 Alpha
	TwoShort: Certainly.  As I said, in this case I think it was the way to go.  I just mention it because  the debate on when to cause a catastrophe is one of the interesting strategic aspects of the game.  More stuff can mean more options, and more chances for the underdog to find something clever or the leader to do something dumb.  You can now fall back and build some more, but I'll build more and faster because I've got a head start.  But then you need to balance that against the pure material balance in the catastrophe.  I rate Y3s as so valuable that I think your catastrophe was certainly worth it on those grounds.   For whatever it's worth, I should note that every experienced player I've played says I'm way more eager to blow stuff up than they would be. :)

27) TwoShort: Move Y1 Gobble Geepamoogle

28) GeepaMoogle: Trade Y3 R3 Geepamoogle

29) TwoShort: Build Y2 Geepamoogle
	TwoShort: I didn't see this before just now, but here's a nasty little move you won't like very much...

30) GeepaMoogle: Trade G1 B1 Alpha
	TwoShort: Though it usually isn't there, that's the sort of move I look for every turn: one that does a couple things at once.  I get more options (room to grow yellow), and you get less. You basically have to spend next turn flipping your 3 point to red.
	TwoShort: Hmm... the more I look at it, I think that's the game. 
	GeepaMoogle: Plan on cattin the homeworld away, eh?  Just as I was going to try to do the same to you.  Where did I go wrong?
	GeepaMoogle: What if I flip my small yellow instead?
	TwoShort: I'll sacrifice my g3 to grow 2 Ys in your homeworld, (and one at gobble) causing the catastrophe anyway.  This will leave me with a 3 point and you without one, and unable to immediately build one.  Then I just need to make sure you remain unable to build one while I move mine in, turn to red, and take over.  Which is why I think you went wrong way back when you let me take the lead in 3 pointers...
	TwoShort: Note that when I say "I think that's the game" I don't mean you can't hold me off a little while longer.  Rather, I think what you'll need to do to hold me off in the short term will let me get enough of a lead that you won't be able to recover.
	GeepaMoogle: Aaah, well, it would seem I am doomed then.  Even with advice I am losing badly and quickly..  Believe me, from my POV  you are an expert..

31) TwoShort: Build Y2 Gobble

32) GeepaMoogle: Move Y1 Geepamoogle Gobble

33) TwoShort: Sacrifice Y2 Geepamoogle
Move Y1 Geepamoogle Gobble
Move Y3 Gobble Bluestar

34) GeepaMoogle: Build G1 Alpha

35) TwoShort: Build G2 Bluestar
	GeepaMoogle: My intentions are probably very obvious, but it's my hope to get you to back off.
	TwoShort: When I've got an advantage is when I tend to  try and push it.  I really should have just caused the catastrophe last turn.  Your intentions may be obvious now, but I didn't see that move last turn.  So now I'm forced to react; I can't let you catch my y3 in a catastrophe.

36) GeepaMoogle: Build Y2 Gobble
Catastrophe Gobble Yellow
	TwoShort: Not that I object to catching your only yellow in a catastrophe, of course.

37) TwoShort: Discover G2 Bluestar Y2 Yolonda
	TwoShort: build g2 bluestar

38) GeepaMoogle: Build R1 Geepamoogle

39) TwoShort: Sacrifice G3 Twoshort
Build G2 Bluestar
Build G3 Yolonda
Build G3 Twoshort

	GeepaMoogle: Sadly, at this point, the best I can do is to attempt to chase away the invader green.  Not really worth playing out.
