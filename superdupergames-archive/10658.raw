benji_stein: Nice. Didn't see that one.

21) Jesse: Trade G2 R2 Moooo

22) benji_stein: Trade Y2 R2 Benji_stein
benji_stein: Gah. I'm tired and can't count. Those should have been red, and it won't let me re-undo it. *sigh*
Jesse: Well, we can correct it. I'll go ahead and take my turn, then you can spend the next two turns trading those ships for red, while I pass. How's that?


23) Jesse: Pass

24) benji_stein: Trade Y1 R1 Benji_stein
benji_stein: Works for me. You're very kind. Thanks!

25) Jesse: Pass

26) benji_stein: Sacrifice G3 Benji_stein
Build G2 Benji_stein
Build G3 Benji_stein
Build B1 Upchuck

27) Jesse: Trade G2 Y2 Moooo
Jesse: No problem. It would be a shame for the game to be derailed by a silly technical issue like that.

28) benji_stein: Move G2 Benji_stein Upchuck
benji_stein: I agree, but it's still appreciated!

29) Jesse: Discover B1 Jesse G2 Oinkoink

30) benji_stein: Move Y1 Benji_stein Upchuck

31) Jesse: Trade G3 Y3 Jesse

32) benji_stein: Discover B1 Upchuck G3 Hurl
benji_stein: Sorry; I should stop undoing moves. I realize if I did that, you'd be able to sac a green ship to build a lot of big blues, leaving me unable to build a big green ship or blue ship for fear of your destroying them.

33) Jesse: Sacrifice G3 Jesse
Build G3 Jesse
Build R2 Moooo
Build R3 Moooo
Jesse: You're right that it's better practice to read the consequences of your moves before submitting, but don't worry about putting me out with undos. As for me building a bunch of blues, if I built two of them, I would have three in one system. Even if your yellow was still at your home system, you could sacrifice it to move one of your small blues to OinkOink and destroy my three blues. That said, moving out the little yellow is still better. You don't want three yellow pieces in your home system. (I don't want three greens for any longer than necessary, either.) You do want more mobility from Upchuck, and a place to safely build more yellow ships. And, it is usually preferable to build new ships, than to trade a ship for a color you already have in the system. (My move here will be an exception.) You should be wanting to spread out your reds and build more of them, as well.

34) benji_stein: Move R1 Benji_stein Upchuck
Jesse: I reduce myself to two greens in my home system, so I don't have to worry so much about my defenses being destroyed if you can get another green piece there. And since there are already two green pieces everywhere you have a green ship, you can't build the large green without bringing the total to three. (Notice that my medium yellow allows me to reach your home system with the G1 at Moooo.) You can't really afford to build it, so I expect to be able to build it on my next turn. I've essentially snagged a Y3 without having to exhaust the pool of smaller yellow pieces first.
benji_stein: Yes, I had noticed that, actually. It's a similar situation with blues, but not quite as beneficial to you. I had been thinking of doing it before your comment, but I like the idea of preventing you from getting the free green.

35) Jesse: Move R3 Moooo Hurl

36) benji_stein: Sacrifice G3 Benji_stein
Build G3 Benji_stein
Build R3 Benji_stein
Build R3 Upchuck

37) Jesse: Attack B1 Hurl
benji_stein: Out of curiosity, is it wiser to move out and threaten your three reds, or to sacrifice a green to build some bigger ships - probably the g3 (otherwise you get it), a b2 and b3, letting you get the final b3?
Jesse: If you'd built the blues, I would have had the opportunity to be first to move out a red in preparation for building more. I can't say definitively which is better, but I would prefer the move you chose, myself.

38) benji_stein: Trade R3 Y3 Benji_stein

39) Jesse: Sacrifice G3 Jesse
Build G3 Moooo
Build R3 Hurl
Build Y1 Moooo
benji_stein: That makes sense, and is probably why I liked it better. I realize the move I just made makes my reds vulnerable for catastrophe, but it was better than letting you get if cheaply, and you'll have to give up a y2 and r2 to destroy my r1 and r2, and the r3 which I otherwise got for free.

40) benji_stein: Move R3 Upchuck Oinkoink
Jesse: Taking out the reds at your home world is certainly a strong possibility, even though it weakens my position in yellow. On balance, I think I prefer this, though.

41) Jesse: Sacrifice G3 Moooo
Build G3 Moooo
Build B2 Oinkoink
Build B3 Hurl
benji_stein: Hmm. Interesting choice. I'm not sure I see the advantage. It lets you get a bunch of blues, but you could have done that before. I don't have any particularly thrilling moves. I think I'd like to move to a new system, but I can't do a whole lot in it for several turns unless I move a green, ewhich leaves my reds still exposed...
Jesse: If I'd built more than one blue before, you could have destroyed them all. This way, I have the advantage in how my blues are dispersed.

42) benji_stein: Sacrifice G3 Benji_stein
Build G3 Benji_stein
Build Y2 Upchuck
Build B3 Upchuck
benji_stein: Hmph. Probably shouldn't have told you I wanted to move out. You stle the last small piece. :P

43) Jesse: Sacrifice Y2 Moooo
Move B1 Oinkoink Upchuck
Move B2 Oinkoink Upchuck
Catastrophe Upchuck B
benji_stein: Gee, there are so many tempting moves. I was toying with blowing up your two big reds, but decided it was probably unwise.
Jesse: Yeah, that would have been very costly.
benji_stein: Yes, but it would have been two r3's of yours for a y3 and two r1s of mine. I'd still have an r3, and you wouldn't be able to swap them for other colors. In pip-count I end up a little ahead, but I'm not sure about positionally.

benji_stein: There was also the "build more stuff" move, but I think I'm getting a little cramped, and I wouldn't want you to destory my fleet too easily, and it lets you get to the big blues for free, since I'd have to build the medium one.

44) benji_stein: Sacrifice Y3 Benji_stein
Move G2 Benji_stein Upchuck
Move G2 Upchuck Moooo
Move G2 Upchuck Moooo
Catastrophe Moooo G

45) Jesse: Sacrifice Y1 Jesse
Discover R3 Hurl Y1 Meow
benji_stein: Yikes. Sure is getting crowded in this galaxy. I don't think I've ever seen so many pieces in use before!
Jesse: Well then, let's clean it up a bit.

46) benji_stein: Move Y1 Upchuck Oinkoink
benji_stein: Yikes. Excellent move. I'm having a hard time coming up with what to do for mine.
benji_stein: The one thing that I think this system could do with is a before/after picture. Or specify what ships get destroyed in catastrophes.

47) Jesse: Trade B3 Y3 Hurl
benji_stein: In the end I was torn between destroying your reds in hurl, or your green in Moooo. The latter was a lot more expensive for me, but you now have only a single g1).

benji_stein: Out of curiosity, what would you have done? A different choice from my final two is also a fine answer.

48) benji_stein: Build Y2 Oinkoink

49) Jesse: Build Y2 Hurl

50) benji_stein: Move R3 Oinkoink Upchuck
benji_stein: I'm confused. What are you threatening, here? You don't have enough greens, blues or yellows to catastrophe my star, and blowing up the reds hurts you more than me. You could potentially move in a couple of big ships, but I could sacrifice an r2 or r3 to capture them at the same time.

benji_stein: I guess I'm just not sure how to respond or plan... :(
Jesse: It's not necessarily an immediate threat. I want to have my R3s separated, to protect them. I want a foothold adjacent to your homeworld, so I can attack eventually, and to keep the pressure on. Trading for the Y3 is to make sure you can't take the advantage in yellow, increase my maneuverability, and improve my rebuilding (medium ships).
Jesse: It does become difficult to plan at this stage of the game. Beginners especially have difficulty figuring out what they should be doing. With both sides having solid positions, it can take a while of jockeying for advantage before either side gains a position to strike a decisive blow.

51) Jesse: Trade R2 G2 Moooo
benji_stein: OK. That makes sense. I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't missing something critical.

benji_stein: Feel free to point out whatever you think migt be useful. I don't normally get to this part, since the other people I play with are beginners as well.

52) benji_stein: Move R3 Upchuck Moooo

61) Jesse: Build Y3 Moooo

62) benji_stein: Move Y2 Upchuck Benji_stein

63) Jesse: Discover Y1 Moooo G1 Neigh
benji_stein: Ick. I botched that one up. I thought I had blue somewhere else... gave you a free 3-pointer. *sigh*
Jesse: One option would have been to use it as a system marker, but that has its own issues.

64) benji_stein: Discover Y2 Benji_stein R1 Retch

65) Jesse: Build G2 Moooo

66) benji_stein: Build G2 Benji_stein

67) Jesse: Move B1 Hurl Neigh
Jesse: Why did you move that to your home world, rather than discovering a new system?
benji_stein: Hmm. I'm not entirely sure. I undid the blue move because if I left two yellows in both systems it allowed you to do the swap-yellow+rebuild from the previous two turns. There hadn't been much that I'd wanted to remove from the stash, since taking a blue, or green would give you access to the bigger ships. But you're right, I should have seen your move coming, so I effectively wasted a turn.

68) benji_stein: Move B1 Benji_stein Retch

74) benji_stein: Move B1 Retch Hurl
Catastrophe Hurl B
benji_stein: I feel like that was probably not a great move, but there's not much better I can do, I think.

75) Jesse: Move G3 Moooo Upchuck

80) benji_stein: Discover Y1 Oinkoink B3 Barf

81) Jesse: Move B3 Neigh Benji_stein
benji_stein: Ouch. I saw that coming, but there wasn't a whole lot I could do. I felt the threat of blowing up my greens was worse. *sigh*

82) benji_stein: Attack B3 Benji_stein
benji_stein: Hmm. Seems like the backend system could do with a little work in organizing the stars.
Jesse: Yeah, it just sorts them in alphabetical order, which is almost never what you want. And the systems could be shown with much less space, and the ships organized within the systems, as well. Easy enough to do for binary games (my own software does a fine job of resizing things), but SDG needs to cope with 3- and 4-player games, as well, where the ideal organization is less obvious.

83) Jesse: Sacrifice Y2 Hurl
Move B1 Neigh Benji_stein
Move B1 Neigh Benji_stein
Catastrophe Benji_stein B
benji_stein: True, I'd forgotten about 3/4 player. 4 Would be odd, but 2 or 3 seems doable by arranging them so that the stars that are connected are nearest, in groups of the same size. So for this game, you'd have my homeworld, all the 1s, all the 3s all the 2s, and then your homeworld. Yes, the 1s connect to the 2s, but at least the groups are easily seen.

84) benji_stein: Build Y2 Oinkoink
benji_stein: *sigh* I think I know what you're about to do, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.
Jesse: Yes, that's exactly how we arrange the systems when we play binary face to face.

85) Jesse: Sacrifice Y3 Jesse
Move Y3 Moooo Benji_stein
Move Y1 Upchuck Benji_stein
Move Y1 Neigh Benji_stein
Catastrophe Benji_stein Y
Jesse: If you were expecting me to sac a Y3 and throw all the blues in at once, here's a lesson in resource conservation.

Jesse: Yes, it's expensive. Blasting someone's home system always is. That's why I prefer to capture their ships, if possible. Or, failing that, wait until I'm sure I can finish the job. Notice that by saving my Y3s, I now have 3 yellows adjacent to your world, and another Y3 ready to sacrifice.
Jesse: Good game. Do you feel like you're getting the hang of it?
benji_stein: Very nice. I saw the yellows getting close (why I'd moved a yellow out earlier), but I'd missed the threat of the third one closer once you'd catastrophed my blues.

benji_stein: I think I'm getting a little better (you would probably be a better judge), but I still don't have the middle game, as you mentioned. I felt like I was always struggling to respond to your moves, and not doing much offensively, myself. Particularly in those cases where I can see it coming (probably too late), but not do anything about it.

benji_stein: I'd be up for another if you'd like, but don't feel obliged if you're tired of it. I'm sure I'm not a terribly challenging opponent.
