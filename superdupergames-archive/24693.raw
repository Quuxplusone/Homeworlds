	Broccoli_Commander: Dear MJ, dreadful agent O,
 
I, the ever healthy Broccoli Commander, would like to express my greenest sympathy to you and your people. You see, with my fellow flowerheads, we had to face an intestine war. One of those that requires a mouthful of diplomatic fibers to settle.
 
Captain Lemon had always added a needed zest to our team. In fact he protected our little seeds and sprouts from the terrible vegan attack of last summer. We had to express our gratitude!
 
But captain Lemon went overboard this time. A rooting spot in the holy lands (with an endless supplies of bees!) was not enough for him. He drained all the cosmopropellant from the entire universe to make a fleet in his glory.
 
Do not worry for us, I think the old disputes have rotten now. But I'm afraid I cannot give you any access to cosmoprop tanks anymore. I can only advise you to stay away from Captain Lemon ships or he might unite his acids with his old pal the T to reduce you to ketchup.
 
Yours delicacy,
The ever healthy Broccoli Commander.
 
PS No seriously: All your base are belong to us. Surrender or tell your kids they gonna have to eat spinach!
	Broccoli_Commander: Hilarious:

	MagicJohn: Oh Czar of Zucchini,
Our heartfelt greetings to you and the Cumquat Queen. (Or vice versa, depending upon who's in charge)
We regret to hear how poorly your Captains obey orders. The insurrection and resulting anarchy must wreck havoc on your magnificent civilization. The stronger hand of the Federation could give you a welcome respite from your societal turmoil.
To prove our sincerity, we are preparing a nutritious compound of potassium nitrate and various other chemicals for your continued good health.
MJ       
	MagicJohn: Oh Pontiff of Peach,
We are sending an emissary to begin a peaceful dialogue and, hopefully, negotiate a lasting peace and mutual respect between our peoples. We trust that your cambium is as pure as one would expect from the leader of such an advanced civilization and our emissary will be safe and treated well.
May your pith forever prosper!
MJ

Our esteemed commander, Private MJ, has been called back to his home planet due to an impending death in his family.
As acting commander, I am organizing the delivery of nutritious consumables to your magnificent ships as quickly as possible. Loading will most certainly be complete in the current growing season.
May your bulbs always bloom.
Major Minor 

27) MagicJohn: Trade G1 B1 Magicjohn
	Broccoli_Commander: Dear Major Minor,
 
Thank you for your generosity, this is more than we would have asked for! We took the liberty of borrowing two of your ships to bring the cargo back to all of our ramifications. I'm sure you understand; rest assured we will return them briskly!
 
I hope Private MJ is alright, we had quite the fun with him. Transmit our condolences, may he not forget that one's soul harvesting leads to new germinations
 
Best wishes of peace, joy and chlorophyll,
The ever healthy Broccoli Commander
