	Draw5PlayAll: I think the issue was the factories. You got all the good stuff and I just got some smalls and mediums. Once you allow a "sac G3, build a bunch of 2's and 3's" move you are toast unless you can counter it.
	ts52: Factories are tough to defend against, but I think the issue this time was letting me get a monopoly on trade, which let me safely build up my large fleet. And also, not building up your own red supply as soon as I started. If you had even a medium red, you could've held me off for a while.
	Draw5PlayAll: Monopoly on trade? I had three blue ships and you never had more than one...
	ts52: Sorry, conflating different games.
