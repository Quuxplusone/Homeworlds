	speardane: For the tournament. Good luck!

6) speardane: Trade G3 R3 Speardane
	Draw5PlayAll: Oh... I did not know the tourney was still going on, nor that the spear Dane account was operational.
	speardane: @Draw5PlayAll: The two things are related. :) wil has three games left to play, and this is one of them.

	speardane: If I ever figure out how to make speardane run autonomously, I'll make it respond to challenges. As long as I'm running it manually, nah. If you have a C++ compiler you can download and play against it offline: https://github.com/Quuxplusone/Homeworlds
	wil: Speardane is an ai?

16) speardane: Build G2 Lebling

17) wil: T B3 Y3 G3

18) speardane: Trade G2 Y2 Lebling
	wil: If I am playing an ai, does it learn from play

19) wil: B B3 G3
	speardane: Tournament contestant "speardane" is an AI (written and operated by ajo). It doesn't "evolve" or "learn" from play; it's more of an expert system consisting of a bag of heuristics.

20) speardane: Build G2 Lebling

21) wil: T B3 R3 G3

22) speardane: Discover G1 Delos B3 Kotok

23) wil: T B3 G3 Wil

Build G2 Speardane
Build G2 Kotok
	wil: Ajo, have you learned anything from speardane?

25) wil: B B3 G3
	speardane: Not really. Speardane's heuristics reflect my biases when writing it, so I'm probably the person least likely to learn something new by playing against it.
	wil: I meant by watching its actions with others

26) speardane: Trade G1 Y1 Kotok

27) wil: T B3 G3 G3

28) speardane: Discover G2 Speardane Y1 Delos

Build G2 Kotok

33) wil: B G2 Y1

34) speardane: Trade G2 R2 Kotok
	wil: Cut and paste my action, c&p computer response?
	wil: What is the methodology you go thru?

35) wil: B R1 G3
	speardane: That's right. Minor reformatting, e.g. the AI will output literally "convert g2 to r2 at Kotok" and then I input that into SDG as "trade g2 r2 Kotok", but yep, the human is in the loop purely as a data-entry specialist. :)

63) wil: B G1 Speardane
C Speardane G
	speardane: Good game!
	wil: Did the computer pass, or you call it quits?
	wil: Must be tough to watch and not modify moves
	speardane: The AI says "pass" when it's checkmated: there's no move better than "pass" if they all lead to defeat.
	wil: Interesting, kudos on writing and playing!!
