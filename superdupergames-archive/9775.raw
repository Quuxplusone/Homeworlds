Participants: stoneaxe (S), Keith (N)
Winner: stoneaxe

1) Keith: Homeworld B1 Y3 G3
Keith: Hello again, This will ba a good game for asking questions or trying things. I will play to give you a challenge but not to overwhelm.

2) stoneaxe: Homeworld R1 B2 G3

3) Keith: Build G1 Keith
stoneaxe: Sounds great!
Keith: I have two questions for you. 1) have you read the SDG wiki on Homeworlds? 2) you seem to prefer a red homeworld. Why?

4) stoneaxe: Build G1 Stoneaxe
stoneaxe: 1) Yes, I have read the wiki and looked at some Archive games. 2) Seems like a strong defensive position and TwoShort does it! What are the considerations of doing this?

5) Keith: Discover G1 Keith Y2 Bend
Keith: TwoShort doing it is certainly a strong endorsement. I think I tried it a few times and decided it was an advanced technique I was not ready for that seemed to slow down my early game development.

6) stoneaxe: Trade G1 Y1 Stoneaxe

7) Keith: Build G1 Keith

8) stoneaxe: Build Y1 Stoneaxe
stoneaxe: For all I know, TwoShort does that just to make it more challenging for himself! Ha. I definitely need to guard against that pair of catastrophe that you got me with last game. Nice play, by the way!

9) Keith: Trade G1 B1 Keith
Keith: Thank you, I was given many hard lessons by Zoltar. Having three of a color at your homeworld is dangerous if the other player has a lot of mobility.

10) stoneaxe: Build G1 Stoneaxe

11) Keith: Move B1 Keith Bend
Keith: One possibility on your last move would be to take the last y1 making it harder for me to get into yellow. I could swap my g3 for a y3 but then I would fall behind a turn, two if I have not created another green ship in my homeworld first. It would leave you with 3 yellows in your homeworld but I don't have one to move in.

12) stoneaxe: Build Y1 Stoneaxe

13) Keith: Build G1 Keith
stoneaxe: I see. Ok, I will try that strategy on this move.
Keith: Well there is that. I am going to have to shut down for the day soon. 1:04AM here and I get up at 5:30AM.

14) stoneaxe: Discover Y1 Stoneaxe B3 Broke
stoneaxe: yeah, it was 1AM for me too. I signed off right after my last move and didn't see your last note. Hope you got some sleep that night.

15) Keith: Build G2 Bend
Keith: About 4 hours. The sleeping part was easy. Getting up though...
Keith: Bend, Broke. Ha ha. How do you decide on system names?

16) stoneaxe: Move G1 Stoneaxe Broke
Keith: This does give me a way to get into Yellow. To prevent it you would have to do something fairly extreme like sacrifice your G3 and build to Y2s in Broke and a Y3 in stoneaxe. Safe for the moment till I got a yellow.

17) Keith: Trade G2 Y2 Bend
stoneaxe: Awww shoot. I shouldve done what you said. But this way I'm threatening to fight you for some green , so which would be better? I Still think what you said wouldve be better.
stoneaxe: System names: I like names of planets or Star Trek worlds or making the first letter of the systems match their color, but then I forget and use a "G" system name on a yellow color and then I try to blow up that system just so I can rename it at the expense of losing the game. ;)
Keith: This is probably safer. If I did get a yellow you would really be in a scramble. Also, there would be the risk that I would dominate green. Though with your move I can't build a green in Bend without you moving a green in and causing a catastrophe.
Keith: I will keep your system naming strategy, and quirks, in mind. I usually pick a subject like Firefly, towns in Oregon, Japanese names.

18) stoneaxe: Build Y2 Broke

19) Keith: Discover Y2 Bend G3 Boring

20) stoneaxe: Build Y3 Broke

21) Keith: Build Y3 Boring
stoneaxe: Whoa! I can't do that! What was I thinking?

22) stoneaxe: Sacrifice Y2 Broke
Move Y1 Stoneaxe Boring
Move Y1 Stoneaxe Boring
Catastrophe Boring Yellow
Keith: I would have pointed it out and let you take it back if you had not noticed.

23) Keith: Discover G1 Keith B2 Prineville

24) stoneaxe: Build G2 Stoneaxe
stoneaxe: Was that dumb? Thats enough mental anguish for me for tonight. :) Goodnite! signing off, for now.
Keith: You blew me up! At least you burned 3 ships doing it.
Keith: It was as expensive as I could make it. Probably still worth it on your part. Good night.
Keith: Look at it this way. We both have 4 ships. You have two 3-pointers and two 1-pointers. I have one 3-pointer and three 1-pointers. I have some initiative because it is my move but it won't make up for the material difference.

25) Keith: Build G2 Keith

26) stoneaxe: Sacrifice G3 Stoneaxe
Build G2 Broke
Build G3 Stoneaxe
Build G3 Stoneaxe

27) Keith: Sacrifice G3 Keith
Build G3 Keith
Build B1 Bend
Build B2 Bend

28) stoneaxe: Trade Y1 R1 Broke
Keith: Very good. The absence of yellow ships on my part makes that a safe move.

29) Keith: Trade B2 Y2 Bend

30) stoneaxe: Trade G2 Y2 Stoneaxe

31) Keith: Build B2 Bend

32) stoneaxe: Move G2 Broke Bend

33) Keith: Sacrifice Y2 Bend
Move B2 Bend Broke
Move B1 Bend Broke
Keith: Do you see the threat I have built that uses blue?

34) stoneaxe: Sacrifice Y3 Broke
Move G3 Stoneaxe Broke
Move G3 Broke Bend
Move G3 Bend Keith
stoneaxe: I think I saw the blue threat: if I would've traded for blue in Broke, you would've moved in 2 more blues and cat'd, right?
Keith: You are on the right track. Though I could provide the fourth blue myself. Two on one turn and one on the next. You have partially diffused it by moving a ship out.

35) Keith: Trade G3 Y3 Keith

36) stoneaxe: Trade G3 R3 Stoneaxe
Keith: You have a number of choices here. You can make a sacrifice and capture my two blues but then I will move in another one and you would lose your y3. You can sacrifice the y3 to evacuate your other ships from Broke. Expensive. It might have been worth it if the g2 was still there. You can sacrifice the r1 and capture my other blue in Bend, though I could then build another one with a green sacrifice. You can run with the y3 and leave the others behind. Or you can sacrifice the y3 and...
Keith: I can build another blue with a green sacrifice and you wouldl lose your ships at Broke. Take it back and see what your best play is involving the Y3.

37) Keith: Sacrifice Y3 Keith
Move B1 Bend Keith
Move G1 Bend Keith
Move G1 Prineville Keith
Catastrophe Keith Green
stoneaxe: Thanks for the help! I'm still learning! This one seems like a better move, but?

stoneaxe: (signing off for tonight... until next time!)

Keith: Good night then.

Keith: You almost had it. The y3 sacrifice was right. But you could have moved the g1 in Broke to Keith and the g2 in Bend to Keith and catastrophied green in Keith and won the game. Though this still gives me a severe problem.

Keith: I ignored a general rule. If the other person pulls a gun (red ship) you had better pull one too.
Keith: If you sacrifice your r1 and convert my g3 at Keith then I am a gonner.

38) stoneaxe: Move G2 Bend Keith
Keith: Guess I am done for because blowing up Broke still leaves you able to move from Bend to Keith with that fourth green.

39) Keith: Trade B2 G2 Broke

40) stoneaxe: Sacrifice R1 Broke
Attack B1 Keith

stoneaxe: You were very generous in this game... Thanks for the help!
Keith: Your welcome. Hope you learned something and enjoyed it.
