	TwoShort: I can win right now if you do that, but it wouldn't not very satisfying, so I'd be happy to have you undo and try something else if you like.
	Subhan64: what is the win move?
	TwoShort: I can sacrifice my y2 to move one of the greens from yolonda all the way to your homeworld, and cause a catastrophe.
	Subhan64: ahh, I see.  I missed that one!  Thanks for the break!

	TwoShort: No problem; Leaving your homeworld vulnerable to a catastrophe is kind of the classic early-game mistake.  I've made it myself a few times.  But it's not all that fun to win that way.

	Subhan64: I think I'm pretty well licked here, good game!
	TwoShort: I'm not sure I'd agree, but OK
	Subhan64: well, what would you have suggested as a move?
	TwoShort: Either moving out or trading one of the greens at your homeworld would avoid the immediate threat. Trading the small to red would probably have been my choice.  To be sure, I had the advantage and your chances of staging a comeback were pretty slim.  But this game is full of surprises, and so I generally won't resign until I can see how my opponent can definitely force victory with a specific series of moves.
