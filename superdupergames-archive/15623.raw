	zoltar: You're in trouble in our 4-player Homeworlds game. Shmil1 can sacrifice his Y2 and move his two G1's into your homeworld and destroy your green star and your G3 and G2, leaving you crippled with only two Y1's and one star left.
	zoltar: In the 4-player game, you're probably going to have to sack your G3 for three Yellow ships to avoid such a disaster.
	mathochist: Oh frak...  that won't even protect me.  Getting rid of one green ship would still leave one green ship and one green star, and he can wipe those out.  I'm not sure there's any way out of that.  Ouch!
	zoltar: Well, if you sac your G3 for three yellows, including a Y3 in your homeworld and a Y3 in your outpost, he might not waste his resources to blow up a star and a G2, figuring that he weakens himself as well this early; but if you leave your G3 there, it's too much of a target to resist. Btw, this is why I start with red and blue stars and never green ones.

19) zoltar: Build Y3 Greenbelt
	mathochist: true.  and I usually don't start with green stars either, but I'm pretty new to the game and still experimenting (like with grabbing the reds early in this game so I could get to the medium pieces quickly.  I'm not sure it really put me ahead of where I would have been anyway, by a couple turns later, y'know?)

20) mathochist: Discover Y2 Mathochist G3 Greensun

21) zoltar: Move R2 Zoltar Greenbelt

22) mathochist: Move Y2 Redhat Bluemoon
	mathochist: well, at least I wound up with 3 large yellows (in the 4 player game).  if he destroys my star, I still have several large pieces and am not *too* badly off, considering.  but I can still hope he doesn't.

23) zoltar: Build R2 Greenbelt
	zoltar: I don't think he well, as you could sack one of your Y3's to move your two Y2's into his homeworld and blow up his star, so he probably doesn't want to weaken both of you by attacking so early. If he doesn't attack, you're in the best position by far.

	zoltar: I looked at the position several times over the weekend and I don't see any way to save my pieces, and sacrificing a Y3 just lets you build it and get an even bigger advantage. Well done, good game.
	mathochist: Thanks!  This was sure an interesting one.  At one point didn't we have all but 1 or 2 of the pieces in play?  Amazing.
