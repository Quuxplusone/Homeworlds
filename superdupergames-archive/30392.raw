	Draw5PlayAll: If you do not like time forfeits, use at least 5/3/7 as the time control. 3/1/10 rarely works.

11) Pheonixian: Trade G1 Y1 Pheonixian
	Draw5PlayAll: Hard time by definition is the variant in which a time forfeit immediately surrenders you. Perhaps sis is good if you find that your opponent moved before you even got to eliminate them.
 
All ladder games are hard time and 3/3/10.

An unexpected surge in energy consumption was experienced in conjunction with a surge in industry, resulting in a failure of temperature regulation and a pipe bursting due to freezing of dihydrogen monoxide. Personnel loss occured. Steps to prevent failure of this manner in the future have been taken.

	dragonlord: Captain's log 121: Increasing strength of Terrace. As said before, farming is taken very seriously on Dragonlord. All these wars cause so much starvation and we will keep everyone who fights for us fed, allies included.

40) Draw5PlayAll: Trade G3 B3 Draw5playall
	Draw5PlayAll: Ah, these intruders again. The ones with this "peace" scandal. Oh, I remember the day when they claimed the destruction of a planet was an "accident". Any reasonable starship captain should know that having a concentration of technology creates an inevitable disaster!
 
We are considering the most efficient way to delete the intruders.

	Draw5PlayAll: I should wait until these aliens fire Felix and appoint a new government. Sadly, I hear he is named "dictator for life and then some".

44) Draw5PlayAll: Attack G2N Draw5playall

45) Felix: Trade G1 B1 Draw5playall

46) dragonlord: Discover G1 Terrace Y2 Solblast
	Draw5PlayAll: I vote we cause a G catastrophe.
	Pheonixian: Where is it you are trying to cause this catastrophe?
	Draw5PlayAll: Ummm.. Uh... Felix or DragonLord's homeworld, obviously...
	dragonlord: I'll assist causing a catastrophe in Felix's homeworld.

47) Pheonixian: Build B2 Seraphim
	Felix: Ah, but may I point out that it is now much easier to cause a blue catastrophe in Draw5's homeworld? Dragonlord, I believe you need to eliminate said world, isn't that right? You know what to do...
	Draw5PlayAll: GAAH!! If you do then I will abandon my homeworld and you will have to defeat Felix instead!
	Draw5PlayAll: Felix, you are actually talking to Phoenixian.. and so am I. Phoenixian can knock out my blue star and ship in one move, and is the one who needs to destroy me.
 
However, if he decides to blow up my star and ship then I will resign the game and blast into hyperspace, leaving the remaining players. Then Phoenixian will have to destroy Felix instead. Muhahaha!

Catastrophe Pheonixian G
	Draw5PlayAll: Felix, if you rip apart my blue star then Phoenixian can have an easy attack... and you do not want him to win because then you lose.
	Felix: I thought whoever eliminated the player to their left just became the winner? In that case, Phoenixian will win if he destroys you. Not ideal...
	Felix: Hmm, but you have a point. Offense may not be the best defense after all.
	Draw5PlayAll: Well, if Phoenixian breaks down one of my stars then I will probably suicide so he does not get the win.
 
This variant is not broken but it seems like it is more last man standing than its intent.

51) Pheonixian: Trade Y1 G1 Seraphim
	Felix: I don't think the system allows you to suicide, but perhaps it does.
	Draw5PlayAll: Even then, I could set up a catastrophe and then tell Felix or DragonLord to finish me off. And they would, unless they WANTED Phoenixian to win.

	Draw5PlayAll: What happened??
	Draw5PlayAll: I really don't want ANOTHER time forfeit! Phoenix lost legitimately, dragon did not!

	Draw5PlayAll: Our people are watching the attack on their computer screens... and fake news about conspiracies and threats to our planet is swarming our communications!
	Draw5PlayAll: There is one too many red in the stash. I win. If Felix stacks, DragonLord can only discover three of them as stars, and if Felix discovers them then he loses ships as I get the first shot.

111) Draw5PlayAll: Trade Y2 R2 B1'
