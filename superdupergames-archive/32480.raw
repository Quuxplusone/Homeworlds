	ts52: I've been trying to decide when the right time was to pull that trigger. We'll see if I made the right call or not.

35) ts52: Attack B1 Forest
	Felix: I think the timing will work out for you, especially with that last move of yours, which was also good! I thought I could get the blue edge on you. I might still, but it will be tricky

	ts52: Thanks. We'll see if it's enough to turn the tide in my favor.

	ts52: I did not see _that_ coming.
	Felix: It took me quite a lot of brain power to come up with that as a possible move. I thought for sure I was a goner. It was you trading away that red that gave me the opening. Great game!
	ts52: Very well played. I look forward to our next.
	ts52: I figured I could get a little extra tempo by trading the red instead of the blue. That'll teach me. :)
	Felix: In any other situation, I think that would have been a great idea. But losing any attack power left you open to that little construction trick. I can't say there's much left of my fleet though! I've never had a game end with only one small left in my possession. Super fascinating game all around.
	ts52: Definitely one for the books. :)
