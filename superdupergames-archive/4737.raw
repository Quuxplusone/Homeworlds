32) Keith: Trade B3 G3 Centaur
	antihero: wow I'm getting destroyed here. This game is not going well.
	Keith: It does look bad for you, and yet it has been a struggle for me.  Your strong grip on the yellow supply and the threat of having that r3 prance through Centaur while it was chock full of my lesser ships has had me putting a lot of time into each of my turns because if my grip on blue falls apart so does my entire game.  

33) antihero: Discover Y2 Antihero B3 Ahhhh

34) Keith: Move G3 Centaur Keith
	antihero: If you wanna see something crazy check out my HW game with unic... (#5098)
	Keith: Wow.  All the 3 pointers makes a big visual splash.  The small universe it really going to change the game.  Any ship that moves out of your homeworld system moves further away from your opponent's homeworld.

35) antihero: Build R1 Forest
	Keith: That does put a nice dent in my recruit a 3 pointer every other turn program.

Move B2 Stopkeith Antihero
Move B3 Centaur Forest
Catastrophe Antihero Blue
	Keith: That was a good offensive and defensive move.  I was going to put a fourth blue and a fourth green in your homeworld.

45) antihero: Sacrifice Y2 Ahhhh
Move R3 Forest Centaur
Move Y2 Ahhhh Antihero
	antihero: It's 1 move a day, which is faster, but this setting means I will run out of time less I think. Do you mind?
	Keith: No problem.  I have not tried the console thingie yet.  Not that computer sophisticated.  I will click on the box in my console message.

46) Keith: Move G1 Keith Antihero
	Keith: I just learned that you can't execute any orders after a catastrophe.  I was going to sacrifice my Y3, move a B2 into your homeworld, catastrophe, then, with our systems one apart move in a green.

	antihero: yes it certainly is...
	antihero: that was my last turn, I believe. Do you see any move that gives me any longer life?
	antihero: The way I see it, I have two options to save my homeworld, both of which will fail:
 
1. Take your g1. Your response, m g3 keith antihero; catastrophe antihero green.
 
2. Move my g1 out of antihero. Your response: sac g3 keith; build g1 antihero; build g1 antihero; build g2 antihero; massive catastrophe antihero green.
	antihero: Good game. I'll have to remember that blue thing -- it really killed me here.
	Keith: You saw right that you were out of options.  I was headed for creating a green catastrophe regardless.  If your prior move had been to evacuate the r3 and the g1 then I think I would have gained material but not had a catastrophe threat going.
	Keith: I am not sure about the blue thing.  It seems to me that blue is a weak color.  The further dimished the stash the further dimished its power...
And yet in my last three games I have grabbed enough blue to at least prevent a blue catastrophe in my homeworld and sometimes to prevent any blue aqusition at all.  I have fallen way behind in yellow while doing so every time but held on to some.  It seems like a risky but viable strategy.
	antihero: when I say "the blue thing" I mean a grab for blue is *very* viable when both homeworlds include a small blue. If you are the first to trade for blue and your opponent doesn't have any medium pieces yet they will either have to trade their large for blue (slows them down some) or allow you to own blue.
