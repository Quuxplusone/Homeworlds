9) Aristos: Discover G3 Aristos Y3 Outlier

10) Danner: Move G1 Danner Outlier
	Aristos: I should resign now. I totally missed that the first move needed to be a trade to green. I've not seen the double-green opening trick before, and it's pretty devastating. I'm assuming the correct response would have been "trade y3 g3 Aristos" as my first move.
	Danner: Yes, that response seems to be correct.
However, you have seen this trick before. :)

	Aristos: Don't recall seeing it. Been too long I guess.
