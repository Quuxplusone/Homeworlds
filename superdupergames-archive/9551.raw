27) scottobear: Trade R1 G1 Monkey
zoltar: Well if you're gonna play THAT way, I'm gettin' me a red ship!
scottobear: sure, sure.. I see how it is!!
scottobear: hmm.. I'm trying to sacrifice my red in monkey to build 2 greens, but I can't seem to do it.. am I missing a rules point?
zoltar: Yes, two rules points apply here.
zoltar: First, you can only sacrifice red to attack, not to build; if you wish to build, you would have to sacrifice a green.
zoltar: Second, you can only sacrifice a 1-pip ship for 1 action, and a 2-pip ship for two actions, and a 3-pip ship for 3 actions.
zoltar: Hence, you'd need to sacrifice a green 2-pip ship to be able to have 2 grows. (In my 2-step 'factory' I've created, I sac my G3 for a B2, and 2 B3s, then sac the B2 to convert one of the B3s to a G3 and the other to either a Y3 or R3; the net result after two moves is an extra 3-pip ship built by my 'factory'.)
zoltar: Hope that answers your rule question.
scottobear: ohh... I was only totally confused there! thanks

scottobear: ok... is this right?
scottobear: sacrifice y1 monkey
scottobear: move y1 kingkong zoltar
scottobear: move y2 kingkong zoltar
scottobear: catastrophe zoltar yellow
zoltar: No. You would have to sac a y2 to get 2 moves; sacking a y1 only gets you one move. Hence, if you had a y2 in monkey instead of a y1, you could sack it and move the two yellows from KingKong to Zoltar and catastrophe the yellows. However, the only y2 you can sac is in KingKong, which is one of the yellows you wanted to move; so the action isn't possible.

zoltar: You could sac a g1 to build another y2 in KingKong, so that on your next turn you could sack it and send the other two yellows in KingKong to Zoltar. But -- seeing you were about to do that, I'd simply move my y2 from Zoltar to KingKong and catastrophe the yellows in KingKong first, so that my Y3 would remain and all of your KingKong yellows would go away, which would favor me (from the position as it is now, I'd lose a y2; you'd lose a Y2, a Y1, and a G1).

zoltar: So your best move might be to build a y2 in Scottobear and threaten to sack it next turn. This forces me to scatter my yellow ships.

Pass
zoltar: Yep, and indeed, while it was checkmate in 5 moves the other way, I think, now I have checkmate immediately.
zoltar: What I was going to do was move my B2 to a small star (in reach of your homeworld, then trade the B3 for a G3, sac the G3 for two blues and a red, then sack a Y3 and send all three reds in and blow up your red star, and the next move sac the other Y3 and blow up your blue star. That's called the "doomsday machine".
zoltar: But you saved yourself all the fancy fireworks by letting me do this cheap maneuver instead, knocking out the red star and slipping a 3-pip ship into your homeworld with my third movement so I can take all your pieces before you could get a red ship to defend. Play again?
