	Tank_7: since it was your turn first i should have gone different homeworld like B3 G1 instead.
	Tank_7: hmm better yet never use the 2nd Size 1 of any color for anything, homeworld or ship
	Tank_7: no wait i take that back, never use the 3rd Size 1... this was 2nd and you traded for 3rd locking me out from blue
	rootbier: you seemed to be there and then you got confusing. don't use the same size 1 in your homeworld build - makes for a good freeze out.
 
by the same token... yeah. if someone trades and grabs the second 1 of a color - as their first trade - try to grab the third so they can't freeze you.
 
maybe that is hard to communicate. just look out for it in the early steps of your next few games.

12) Tank_7: Discover Y1 Tank_7 G2 Kentares
