	papa_bear: If you choose to accept Castle Danger, it is unrated I have set it for you to play first player, which is a significant advantage. I am also prepared to suggest undos in case of serious mistakes, especially in the opening. Certain mistakes which are bad enough to ruin a game can nevertheless be difficult for new players to spot. If you accept it and prefer for me to keep my suggestions to myself, I can do that too :) Finally, if for any reason you'd rather not accept that challenge, there would be no hard feelings.
	MatrixFrog: I'm a little busy for a few days. I'll read the rules sometime this weekend probably and get that started.

18) MatrixFrog: Trade Y2 G2 Matrixfrog
	papa_bear: I'm afraid I'm unfamiliar with Honk. What is it?
 
I enjoyed The Matrix, although I thought the sequels left a bit to be desired. Great action and sound effects, but the story grew in disappointing ways in the sequels.
	MatrixFrog: It's a musical based on the Ugly Duckling.

19) papa_bear: Trade G1 B1 Papa_bear

20) MatrixFrog: Move Y1 Rix Papa_bear
	papa_bear: Ah... I must confess that musicals are mostly outside my familiarity. I did, in high school, participate in the "pit orchestra" for three of them. Apparently, shoving an adolescent marching band into a dark cave under a stage transforms them into an "orchestra" :)
	MatrixFrog: No, it doesn't. You also need to have music stands and pencils and wear black. THEN you're an orchestra.

21) papa_bear: Move Y2 Gimmel Rix
	papa_bear: Aha! I knew we weren't an orchestra. We didn't wear black.
 
Guys and Dolls, Anything Goes, Oklahoma. I've never actually seen any of them, because the view from the pit was no good.

	MatrixFrog: I think perhaps t y3 r3 matrixfrog is what I should have done.

27) papa_bear: Build B1 Matrixfrog
