	unic: By the way, if you fancy playing anything else besides Homeworlds, feel free to throw a challenge my way - I'm up for more or less any pure abstract (no luck, no hidden information, no simultaneous choices).

5) zoltar: Trade G1 Y1 Zoltar
	zoltar: Sure. That is an interesting distinction, btw. Having played chess since I was barely able to read, I have a special liking for pure abstract games; most of the game developers I play with at LooneyLabs however prefer games with some random chance mechanism or hidden information. I like both kinds. I have just learned Pikemen, and I know the developer of that game as well, Jacob Davenport. I won my first two games so far, which were against other beginners. I'll challenge you to that one.
