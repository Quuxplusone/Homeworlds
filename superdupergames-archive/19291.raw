	ts52: That's tough to say. Generally, if your enemy has a gun (red) you should have a gun. That's one good adage. Also, building up a doomsday machine (3 pieces of a color and large yellow) to use to destroy part of your opponents homeworld is another common strategy.

	ts52: Thanks for the game. I'd be happy to play again, any time.
	javico: thanks for teach me in this game, but i'm afraid that i didnt like it too much. In my opinion, it has too many restrictions and there is a moment in the game that you can make only a few movements.
	ts52: Fair enough. The simplicity of it is something I enjoy, but it's not for everyone.
