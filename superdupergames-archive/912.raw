2) Aaron: Homeworld Y1 B2 G3
	Pat: *YAY* Happy to play with you. I'm brand-spankin'-new to this game, so you're the one that sholdn't worry about any challenges. .P
	Aaron: Be sure to read the wiki.  There are lots of helpful hints there.

3) Pat: Build G1 Pat
	Pat: Well...it seems foolish to not have a yellow in my starting homeworld, huh.

4) Aaron: Build G1 Aaron
	Aaron: oh, and no blue either...aye, I'm afraid we will have to start again.  I don't see any way to get blue or yellow from where you're at.
