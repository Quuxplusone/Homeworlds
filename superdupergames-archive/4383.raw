Participants: mjbuyck (S), zoltar (N)
Winner: zoltar

1) zoltar:
Homeworld B3 Y1 G3
	mjbuyck: Well that had to have been the shortest game of HW ever... let's try that again.
I totally forgot that rule.
	zoltar: h b3 y1 g3

2) mjbuyck: Homeworld B2 G3 Y3
	zoltar: It takes a long time to get the 'feel' for this game (unlike say, Pikemen, where you can get most of the strategy after a game or two), but I think it is well worth it, once you figure out how to build and organize your pieces well.

3) zoltar: Build G1 Zoltar

4) mjbuyck: Build Y1 Mjbuyck

5) zoltar: Build G1 Zoltar

15) zoltar: Trade G2 B2 Blueridge

16) mjbuyck: Move B1 Mjbuyck Winterfell
	zoltar: Btw, just want to make sure you see the 'trap' here. If you build another blue ship right now in your homeworld, I can sacrifice my Y2 ship for two movements, and move my B2 ship into your homeworld : this would create a fourth blue so that I could blow up all the blue ships and your blue homeworld star.

17) zoltar: Discover B2 Blueridge G3 Greenhills
	mjbuyck: I understand that, but how? I would have only had three blues in the system then.
	mjbuyck: Oh, nm.

Catastrophe Mjbuyck Y
	zoltar: Ouch! Building a third Yellow when I could sack and blow them up was very bad, but having nothing but yellow ships in your system was fatal.  Sorry, I should have warned you and had you taken it back, but like the other game, it doesn't give me a choice now to take back my move once a homeworld has blown up. 
	mjbuyck: ah... I thought you couldn't put the fourth yellow in my system. I thought that the moving piece had to be in the same system. That'll teach me to read the rules better.
	zoltar: It's any 4 of the same color, whether your ships, my ships, or a star, and my sacrifice allowed me to to so. Again, I was playing fast jumping from game to game, and I forgot I should tell you this and have you undo it, which I would have done if I had taken some time. Don't get discouraged, though: it's a great game and I lost a bunch of games before I ever won one and got the hang of it.
	mjbuyck: That's what I meant, I knew what would happen if you stuck in a fourth, but due to a rule misconception I figured that it wasn't possible that turn.
