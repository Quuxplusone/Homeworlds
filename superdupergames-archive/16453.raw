	zara2stra: Just after ending the previous game I realized the flaw of this mod. Since you exactly know who you are after and who's after you, the third player can choose exactly the same planet sizes for his homeworld to draw himself near to his designated enemy. No, I didn't want to share it before the start of this game ;)
	AdamBadura: Yes. Indeed. In two players mode this is not a good strategy but in this mode it might be.

58) zara2stra: Move G2 Endymion Adambadura

59) AdamBadura: Attack G2N Adambadura
	AdamBadura: I wonder what zara2stra meant with this move.
 
I am eager to see but somehow command:
attack G2 AdamBadura
claims that:
"The ship G2 could not be found in the AdamBadura system."
 
What to do now?
 
And by the way: if both of you would have the same ship in my system how would I tell which one to attack?
	zara2stra: in the help, it says you should attack with a player designation so to attack my g2 you should attack g2n adambadura

60) goulo: Trade B3 G3 Arbeto
	AdamBadura: It helped. Thanks! I two players mode it allowed to skip player mark and so I didn't new it is required.

	goulo: Or 6, I forget how many exactly. :)

71) AdamBadura: Discover G2 Adambadura Y3 Endlessrage

72) goulo: Build G1 Hyperion
	AdamBadura: So as I see kill the one on your left was changed to kill AdamBadura... ;)
	goulo: No, just good old fashioned "hurt the guy with the most ships AND the most 3-ships". :) After that result, we all became more equal.

73) zara2stra: Sacrifice G2 Endymion
Build G1 Adambadura
Build G2 Adambadura
Catastrophe Adambadura G
	zara2stra: besides, as I see it, goulo needed the supplies in the yellow stash :P I see this as an opportunity to use a plan he thwarted few turns earlier

	zara2stra: The first time I tried it goulo took the last g ship from the stash

76) zara2stra: Trade R1 G1 Endymion
	AdamBadura: Now I have to twice that careful. The game really got complex with goulo attacking me instead of zara2stra ;) and now loosing one of my stars... :(
	zara2stra: But that was normal - your fleet heeded his way.
	zara2stra: I mean, most of the time players plot to get as close to their target with as large fleet as possible, occasionally thwarting plans of the player who tries to get them. 
	zara2stra: I mean, most of the time players plot to get as close to their target with as large fleet as possible, occasionally thwarting plans of the player who tries to get them.

82) zara2stra: Trade G2 Y2 Endymion
	AdamBadura: However I am afraid this might have allowed zara2stra to win.
 
So consider goulo securing me for some time. As stupid as it sounds keep in mind that I am an easy target now and if zara2stra wins you will not... ;)

Catastrophe Zara2stra R
	zara2stra: check
	zara2stra: ooops, should probably take that back - but in a live game I would really miss that possibility :(
	zara2stra: Ok, I take the last statement back - it seems that it was a good move after all :) 
	zara2stra: for several minutes after the last move I thought that goulo will be able to catastrophe me with red in my HS
	zara2stra: oh but he will - excuse me, I'm really tired ;)
	zara2stra: shitshitshit - ROTFL. I just explained how to win to my oponent. Note to self for future plays: do not make hasty moves after a several hour brake from analysing the situation.
	zara2stra: I just described my hilarious mistake on Blip. Folko sends his regards :)
	AdamBadura: Hmmm... I agree to undo your last move since you have seen it before I did and I guess befor goulo did as well. So if you still want to undo and goulo doesn't mind the do it. Otherwise let me know to continue.
	goulo: Ummm. what a strange chat sequence! I guess take it back, given our convention so far in this game. And perhaps next game we should simply play with the No Undo option to avoid these confusing dilemmas. :) 
	goulo: By the way, convince Folko to start playing at superdupergames! I told him about it, but he is lazy and distracted. :)
	zara2stra: naah, I won't undo it - that's exactly the kind of error that often happens during a live game. I'll try to talk Folko into playing here - I think he would like it:) And BTW - Homeworlds once more? or maybe something light like Blam! I would also like to try the online interpretation of Alien City, but it's two player only. 

	AdamBadura: So lets goulo finish the game properly.
 
I would gladly play another one. Also I want to play Skur√∞ir but they don't have it here.
	AdamBadura: By the way I wonder what did you intend to do now after moving those two B ships into my homeworld? Did you count on goulo to finish me off (as you already cooparted in the past agains me... :P)?
	AdamBadura: Sacrificing a G ship. Now I see it. Nice. A close game. Saddly not for me... ;)
	goulo: thanks for the game!
I will happily play this again, as well as Blam, Branches, Martian Chess, Subdivision, all of which are neat little pyramid games I've played in real life and here online. Adam, will you join us for Blam? And do either of you want to play any of the others as well?
 
I've never played Alien City but always heard it's good. Feel free to challenge me, zara.
	AdamBadura: I never played Blam. I don't know the rules so start without me if you want to as I don't know when I will read them.
	zara2stra: Ok, I'll challenge you during the weekend - I have a business trip to Pozna&#324; tommorow, so for most of the time I won't have access to a computer. As for Homeworlds and Blam, we can start today :) Thanks for the game.
	zara2stra: Adam, the rules for blam are easy - you place pyramids on a chessboard and all surrounding pyramids move away from the piece you place. The goal is for pyramids to fall from the board. You take your pyramids to use them again, and take any pieces from other players as trophies. that's all :)
	AdamBadura: Seems easy enogh. You may challange me as well... :)
