jerzy: Could you tell me more about openings, i.e., what are their names and what one should be doing after each of them?

4) jerzy: Build G1 Jerzy

6) jerzy: Trade G1 Y1 Jerzy
zoltar: Actually, openings are my biggest weakness! But I know the names. The strongest is "the banker" which is a small and medium star. It allows you to go to large stars first, and you can 'invest' in a large star by placing a g1 or g2 on it. When the color is used up, (e.g., suppose you had a g2 on a y3 star), you could sack the g2, and build the y3 somewhere you have a yellow piece, and rebuild the g2 at the same time, somewhere you have a green piece. Because large pieces are next to your homeworld and easy to 'invest' in, small-medium systems are called "The Banker".

zoltar: I'm playing "The Fortress" which is the best defensive position later on, because only small stars are connected to my homeworld, and you run out of small pieces in the middlegame, so it's harder to attack the homeworld. The disadvantage is that I have to use small pieces to expand, and my opponent can more easily calculate so that he will get the first middle-sized piece in a particular color.

zoltar: You're playing the third kind, called "goldilox" because your homeworld is adjacent to middle-sized pieces. Some players prefer this one most of all, but I don't know yet the advantages or disadvantages.

zoltar: The top player of all time, Andy Looney, swears that the banker is the strongest, and gives a strong advantage; the second best player in the world, who goes here by TwoShort, disagrees and doesn't think the banker gives anyone more than a minimal edge. However, the banker is the easiest for beginners, so I used it for all my first dozen or so games, and recommend you get familiar with it.

zoltar: Usually any ybg color combo is good to start, which ships usually being y or g, but recently the top players are using red stars. I'm trying them out (as in this game). It's harder in the opening, but later on, you have a strong defence, as you don't need a red ship in your homeworld to defend, but it is tougher for beginners because red is used least in the opening, so you have to build more ships before you can use the other three color powers, all of which are used in the opening.

zoltar: That's about all I know about openings.
jerzy: Man, thanks a lot! That clarifies a lot of things! I thought the names refered to the colors you chose to start with, rather than color/size combinations. I thought I was playing the banker!

jerzy: Maybe we could add a section about openings to the Wiki, that would be very helpful for newbies!

7) zoltar: Build Y2 Zoltar
zoltar: The publisher of the game (and world champ) Andy Looney of Looney Labs, and the author of the game, John Cooper, are working on that now, in a new booklet that will introduce 3 Looney Labs games together. We can get them to transfer the final version to the Wiki perhaps. I'll suggest it to them (they are both my neighbors).

8) jerzy: Build Y2 Jerzy

9) zoltar: Build Y2 Zoltar

10) jerzy: Discover Y1 Jerzy G2 Darwin
jerzy: Ah, you're talking about '3house' perhaps? I'm looking forward to it... Do suggest the Wiki transfer!

11) zoltar: Trade Y1 R1 Zoltar
zoltar: Yes, I am talking about 3house!

12) jerzy: Trade Y2 B2 Jerzy

13) zoltar: Discover Y2 Zoltar G1 Greenbelt
jerzy: It must be a priviledge for you to be neighbour to the two greatest game designers IMO! I am from Brazil, and it's nearly impossible cost-wise for us to import Icehouse pieces...

jerzy: I have made my own set of flat wooden pieces, much like Zarf's Zarcana ones.
zoltar: Yes, it is quite a priviledge. I only wish I'd known them longer, as they were neighbors for years before I met any of them or heard of any of these games.

14) jerzy: Build B1 Jerzy

15) zoltar: Build G1 Zoltar
jerzy: I've been trying to figure how to use the blue pieces to my advantage, since it's such an unused color...
zoltar: If you can get all of the small ones on the board, then you can build large blue pieces, trade them for other large pieces, then build them again and repeat the process. Also, a large blue can always threaten to capture a smaller piece if you have a red piece somewhere to sacrifice.

16) jerzy: Build G1 Jerzy

jerzy: Hehe what a stupid way to may a straightforward move.
jerzy: Should've recreated that g2 in mango.

25) zoltar: Sacrifice Y3 Zoltar
Move R1 Zoltar Lemon
Move G3 Lemon Mango
Move G3 Mango Jerzy

26) jerzy: Sacrifice B2 Jerzy
Trade G3 Y3 Jerzy
Trade G2 R2 Jerzy

27) zoltar: Sacrifice R1 Zoltar
Attack R2 Jerzy
zoltar: You made the mistake of not trading one of your blue ships for a red ship. Now you are in a bit of trouble.

zoltar: Actually, it's checkmate in a move or two. Your only way to stay alive was to move your own g1 back to your homeworld and blow up your greens and mine with them. Or trade your b1 in mango for an r1, (threatening to sac and capture my g3), forcing me to sac a green and rebuild it in your homeworld and blow up your greens (I would sac my g2 in Zoltar, and rebuild it in your homeworld using that 'teleport' trick you discovered, and use the extra build to rebuild my y3 in Zoltar -- I would end up with three big ships to your one, and your y3 would have to immediately run back to your homeworld to defend -- not a pretty outcome, but the only scenerio where you survive. And all this because you didn't get a red ship after I did.
jerzy: I see... Gonna accept your pending challenge now, I'll try the Banker...
