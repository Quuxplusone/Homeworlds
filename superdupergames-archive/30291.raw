	Simon: Have fun :)
	Felix: You too! Good luck :) hey, how do you set it up so that your open challenge automatically renews after someone accepts it? Make sense? I'm tired of having to set up new challenges each time...
	Simon: The feature is called Standing challenge, accessible from main navigation -> Challenges -> Manage standing challenges, near the top.
	Draw5PlayAll: Though personally I dislike it because if I go AFK unexpectedly for long periods of time, I can accumulate vast numbers of time forfeits. Just look at wil.

	Draw5PlayAll: Klingon invasion!

	Felix: *Closes eyes tightly and prays this will work*
	Simon: gg
	Felix: It was touch and go there at the end. Good game!
	Simon: "A catastrophe occurred in the Felix system. All conversion (B) technology was lost."
This would have made sense only if I could move the reds, then build 2 reds afterwards. But there would have been only 1 in the stash, that's wasn't a followup thread. :-)
	Felix: Yeah, it probably would have been wiser to try to capture one or more of my reds before connecting our systems with that catastrophe. It ended up working in my favor to have our systems connected like that...
	Draw5PlayAll: I hate connecting the systems and I prefer to trigger the one that will not cause a connection.
