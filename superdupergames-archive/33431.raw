Homeworlds Online (SDG# 33431)
Variants: "Unrated"
Started: 2017.11.13, Ended: 2017.12.6
Participants: smokeytroll42 (S), Babamots (N)
Winner: Babamots

1) Babamots: Homeworld B2 Y1 G3

2) smokeytroll42: Homeworld R1 B2 G3
	Babamots: OK, my turn for the banker system.

3) Babamots: Build G1 Babamots
	Babamots: Or we can both be bankers :-).

4) smokeytroll42: Build G1 Smokeytroll42
	smokeytroll42: I'm a little confused on the theory behind the starting homeworlds. Is it determined more color or size? 

5) Babamots: Trade G1 R1 Babamots
	Draw5PlayAll: With a yellow star you can move on your third turn, but you cannot safely keep yellow ships there. With a red star you can resist certain kinds of attacks without actually needing to get a red ship, though it is easy to get cocky with this.
	Babamots: Andy introduced 3 terms to refer to the size combinations of home markers:
 
Banker: small, medium
Goldilocks: small, large
Fortress: medium, large
 
A brief explanation for these names is on page two of these rules:
http://www.looneylabs.com/sites/default/files/rules/Homeworlds.pdf
 
I haven't read much discussion on starting colors, but it's pretty obvious that you want to start with green and blue (one of these can be your ship). The third color (red vs yellow) is what's worth debating.

6) smokeytroll42: Trade G1 R1 Smokeytroll42
	Babamots: If you don't get a red ship now, you could get frozen out for a while.

7) Babamots: Build R2 Babamots

8) smokeytroll42: Build R2 Smokeytroll42

9) Babamots: Build R2 Babamots
	smokeytroll42: I think were in an arms race.
	Babamots: It's been my experience that players compete for whatever color has the largest ships available.

10) smokeytroll42: Trade R1 Y1 Smokeytroll42

11) Babamots: Discover R2 Babamots B3 Galorndon

12) smokeytroll42: Build Y1 Smokeytroll42

13) Babamots: Trade R2 Y2 Babamots

14) smokeytroll42: Build Y2 Smokeytroll42

15) Babamots: Discover Y2 Babamots G3 Vulcan

16) smokeytroll42: Discover Y2 Smokeytroll42 B3 Risa

17) Babamots: Build R1 Babamots
	Babamots: I don't think you want to do that. My move should be
 
sacrifice r1 Babamots
attack r2s Vulcan
 
Feel free to undo and try something else.

18) smokeytroll42: Move Y1 Smokeytroll42 Risa
	smokeytroll42: I always forget how red sacrifice works. 

19) Babamots: Discover R1 Babamots Y3 Omicrontheta

20) smokeytroll42: Move R2 Smokeytroll42 Omicrontheta
	Draw5PlayAll: Is Risa the planet that initiated the augmented reality game in TNG: The Game?
	smokeytroll42: Its a pleasure Planet that Picard goes on vacation to for a few days in TNG. Naturally things go awry.

21) Babamots: Sacrifice G3 Babamots
Build R2 Galorndon
Build R3 Omicrontheta
Build R3 Babamots
	Babamots: Also, yes, Riker was on Risa when the brain-control game device was given to him.

22) smokeytroll42: Sacrifice G3 Smokeytroll42
Build R3 Omicrontheta
Catastrophe Omicrontheta R
Build Y2 Risa
Build Y3 Smokeytroll42
	Babamots: My intended next move is
 
sacrifice g3 Babamots
build r2 OmicronTheta
build r3 Galorndon
build r3 Babamots
 
This gives me an additional large ship, and you are not free to take the last r3 because building it in your home system will allow me to cause a red catastrophe there.
	Babamots: You have a way to keep me from getting that additional large ship and a (different) way to make it so I can complete that move, but so that you can safely build an r3 afterward.
Can you see how to do these things?
	smokeytroll42: Discover an R3 Star? The second, just move the R2 out of Smokeytroll42

23) Babamots: Build Y3 Vulcan
	Babamots: Sorry, I had a lot going on today and tomorrow looks busy too.
 
The reason I think you should be so concerned about my next move is that it gives me a large ship advantage, which is usually a big deal.
 
Unfortunately, discovering only one r3 star won't prevent me from building the other two. You could discover two r3 stars if you're willing to sacrifice your y2, however. If you discover two r3 stars, there will only be one r3 piece left, and I can only build one (and if I sacrifice a g3 to do it, I have the same number of large ships as before).
 
Another option for (temporarily) blocking my move is to trade your r2 for another color (I would have to build both r2s before getting any r3). This probably isn't a great move since it leaves you with no red at all, which allows me to build the r3s at my leisure.
A possibly better option is to get your r2 to a green system so that you can safely build an r3 if I build the r2. Since all the g3 are used, you would need to sacrifice y2 to move r2 twice to a g2 or g1.
 
You may want to instead move your r2 to OmicronTheta. If I build an r2, you can then move your r2 to a new green star and be ready to build the last r3. If I don't build an r2, you can attack my r1 (unless I run for it.)
 
I'm not positive that's your best move, but I probably won't have time to look for better moves for you until tomorrow evening.
	smokeytroll42: No worries! I understand. 

24) smokeytroll42: Discover Y1 Risa G2 Ceti Alpha V
	Babamots: I see a problem with the plan I suggested (but I don't have a better idea for you yet)
 
me:
sacrifice g3 Babamots
build r2 Galorndon
build r3 OmicronTheta
build r3 Babamots
 
you:
discover r2 OmicronTheta g1 BestNameEver
(planning to build an r3 since I won't be able to)
 
me: 
move r3 OmicronTheta BestNameEver
(I'm ready to capture your r3 as soon as you build it or I'll take your r2 if you don't build the r3)
	smokeytroll42: Well, we can let it play out. Sorry, I also had a busy one today. 
	Babamots: Today was even more exhausting that yesterday. I should have time to take a good look at the game tomorrow.
 
Another move you could consider:
 
sacrifice g3 smoketroll42
build r3 OmicronTheta
catastrophe OmicronTheta r
build y2 Risa
build y3 smoketroll42
 
I haven't worked out the consequences, but it does destroy the r3 I'm about to build and you still have a large ship. Unfortunately, I would then be able to build y3, but (due to the destruction of OmicronTheta) there will be another y3 piece around. Maybe you can beat me to it? I'm not sure yet.

25) Babamots: Pass
	Babamots: I wanted to give you plenty of time to change your mind rather than holding you to trying to take my bad advice :-P.

26) smokeytroll42: Trade Y3 G3 Smokeytroll42
	smokeytroll42: No worries! I appreciate all the mentoring!

27) Babamots: Sacrifice Y2 Vulcan
Move R2 Galorndon Ceti
Move R2 Ceti Risa
	smokeytroll42: So I'm thinking Discover a Green Star with Y1 from Risa, then build the Y3 there?

28) smokeytroll42: Sacrifice G3 Smokeytroll42
Build Y2 Ceti
Build Y3 Smokeytroll42
Build Y3 Risa
	Babamots: Sorry, another busy day (I should be more responsive the rest of this week).
 
If you stick with your most recent move, I will win in two moves. Would you like to try to figure out how?

29) Babamots: Sacrifice R2 Galorndon
Attack Y2S Risa
Attack Y2S Risa
	Babamots: If you want to know why I can win from here, read the following backward (bottom to top, right to left)

30) smokeytroll42: Trade Y3 G3 Smokeytroll42
	Babamots: Rather than sitting around with an expired timer (wondering if you want to undo), I'll just pass this turn. I will win if you build that y3.
	smokeytroll42: mmm I'm trying to work it out. I'll give it some more thought throughout the day tomorrow
	Babamots: Take your time. I won't end the game even if your timer runs out.
	smokeytroll42: I haven't had much time to sit and look it over. Sorry for the delay
	smokeytroll42: Okay, so after processing all that, I don't have a move to survive?
	Babamots: You can survive, but you need to defend your home immediately. You need to trade one of your yellow ships for another color (either y3 for g3 or y1 for g1 is best).
	smokeytroll42: Oh right, to protect from the catastrophe.

31) Babamots: Trade Y2 G2 Risa

32) smokeytroll42: Trade Y3 R3 Risa
	Babamots: Looking at it 5 seconds later, mine was not such a good move. It doesn't actually stop you form getting the y3 ships like I thought (in fact, you can get both). One move you may want to consider is something like
 
sacrifice g3 smokeytroll42
build y2 Ceti
build y3 smokeytroll42
build y3 Risa

33) Babamots: Sacrifice G2 Risa
Build R1 Risa
Build R2 Risa
Catastrophe Risa R

34) smokeytroll42: Build G1 Smokeytroll42

35) Babamots: Trade R3 G3 Babamots
	Babamots: I didn't notice until now that my advice for your last turn should have come with a warning. It made it so you again have only yellow in your home system. That was OK when I only had one yellow ship, but as soon as I captured your yellow ships, you were in danger of losing by catastrophe again. You should trade one of your home-system yellow ships for a green again. It might seem like that move is just running in circles, but remember that you gained two ships (a medium and a large) in the process.
 
If you don't undo, I'll win.

36) smokeytroll42: Discover G1 Smokeytroll42 B3 Mintakaiii
	Babamots: Specifically, my move now should be
 
sacrifice y2 Risa
move y3 Vulcan smokeytroll42
move y2 Risa smokeytroll42
catastrophe smokeytroll42 y

37) Babamots: Build R1 Babamots

38) smokeytroll42: Build Y2 Smokeytroll42

39) Babamots: Build R2 Babamots

40) smokeytroll42: Discover Y1 Ceti B3 Qo'nos
	smokeytroll42: Ah, I need to remember that you build wherever theres a green ship.
	Babamots: I'm a big fan of green sacrifices. They can take your opponent off guard pretty often.
	Babamots: And remember that the build actions don't need to happen in the same system where the sacrifice is. I just happened to sacrifice and build in the same system this time.
	smokeytroll42: Does there have to a green star or ship in the system where the build action occurs? Same question with attacking or trading?
	Babamots: This is important to understand, so here's a quick summary of how to use colors. There are three kinds of turns:
 
1) "Regular"
In a normal turn (without a sacrifice), one of your ships uses the technology of a marker in that ship's system or the technology of any ship that you own in that system. If you have a blue ship (or marker) in a system, any of your ships in that system can be traded for another color. If you have a yellow ship (or marker) in a system, any of your ships in that system can move to another system.
 
2) "Sacrifice"
When you do a sacrifice, you destroy one of your ships and use its technology to perform a number of actions up to the size of the ship you destroyed. The actions can be taken in any system (whether you have the sacrificed technology there or not).
 
3) "Pass"
You don't do anything at all.
	Babamots: So the answer to your question is no (assuming we're talking about a sacrifice). There does not need to be green in a system where you build after a green sacrifice.
	smokeytroll42: Yes, I believe that does!
	smokeytroll42: Actually maybe not. Do you still need a ship, of some color, in the system to do the sacrifice action in that system? Like right now I couldnt: 
 
Sacrifice g3 smokeytroll42
Build R1 Babamots
Build R2 Babamots 
Catastrophe Babamots r
	Babamots: I think of it like this: you have to apply every action to one of your own ships (whether that action came from a sacrifice or "regular" turn). Applying green to a ship means you build a new ship of that ship's color. You don't have a ship in my home system, so you can't build there.
 
Red is a special case where you pick one of your own ships to do the attacking (whichever is the largest in the system) and you also have to pick an enemy target ship.
	Babamots: So, yes, before you can build a ship, you need to have a ship of the same color in the system where you build.
	smokeytroll42: In other words, I would need a red in Babamots for that move to work?
	Babamots: Yes, you would need a red ship in Babamots in order to build a red ship in Babamots.

41) Babamots: Move Y2 Risa Ceti

42) smokeytroll42: Move Y2 Ceti Mintakaiii

43) Babamots: Build Y3 Ceti

44) smokeytroll42: Sacrifice Y2 Smokeytroll42
Move Y1 Qo'nos Ceti
Move Y2 Mintakaiii Ceti
Catastrophe Ceti Y

45) Babamots: Move R2 Babamots Mintakaiii
	Babamots: You've done a good job of using up the small and medium pieces of the color that you have the most control of (yellow). Unless I can find a good way to block you, you will be able to build a large yellow ship, but only if you spread out your current yellow ships. Right now, if you build a y3 at your home or in Ceti, I can move in my y2 for a catastrophe. If you move one of your yellows out of those systems, you could build safely.
 
I think the main weakness of your position right now is that you don't have any red ships. Right now, if I move my y2 into Ceti, then I'll be able to capture one of your ships be sacrificing my r1 in Babamots (unless you sacrifice a yellow in order to remove both of your ships from Ceti in the same move). Getting you to sacrifice a piece you didn't want to is a small victory for me.

46) smokeytroll42: Sacrifice G1 Mintakaiii
Build G1 Smokeytroll42

47) Babamots: Move R1 Babamots Vulcan

48) smokeytroll42: Build Y1 Smokeytroll42
	Babamots: Your best responses are probably
 
1) Moving your y2 away from Ceti so I can't attack it. After that, I think we get to safely build one y3 each.
2) Building a y3, either at home or in Ceti. If you build in Ceti, I plan to build a y3 there as well and catastrophe all of them. If you build a y3 at home, I will either attack your y2 in Ceti or possibly move my y3 into your home system for the catastrophe.

49) Babamots: Sacrifice G3 Babamots
Build R2 Mintakaiii
Build R2 Vulcan
Build R3 Babamots

50) smokeytroll42: Discover G1 Smokeytroll42 Y3 Arrakis
	smokeytroll42: So I could sacrifice Y2 in the Homeworld to move in 2 yellows for catastrophe at Ceti, or build Y3 MintakaIII.
	Babamots: Yes, I should have mentioned that catastrophe option earlier. I thought that was building is best for you, but I've realized that you will lose after that. Consider this continuation:
 
you
build y3 MintakaIII
 
me
sacrifice y3 Ceti
move g3 Babamots Vulcan
move y3 Vulcan smokeytroll42
move g3 Vulcan smokeytroll42
 
You don't have a way to win from this point:
 
1) If you attack one of my larges, I sacrifice my r2 to attack both your g3 and whichever large you just attacked. I'll win in a few moves by attacking the rest of your home ships.
 
2) If you try to defend by moving your new y3 into your home, I can sacrifice my r2 to attack both your g3 and y3. Again, I can attack your ships freely until I win.
 
So to sum up, you should do the catastrophe.
	Babamots: And I love "Who Watches the Watchers" :-)
	smokeytroll42: Yes, its one of my favs from my edgy college skeptic days. And still is.

51) Babamots: Build R3 Vulcan

	smokeytroll42: Is there any way to prevent the impending attack on my Homeworld?
	Babamots: I'm afraid you're pretty doomed. You didn't have a chance to get red ships, and since I've taken most of them, I'll win soon after I can move two large ships into your home at once.
 
I think the best thing you can do to prolong the game is to build y2. My current plan goes like this:
 
1)
trade r2 y2 MintakaIII
 
2)
sacrifice y2 MintakaIII
move y3 Vulcan smokeytroll42
move r3 Vulcan smokeytroll42
 
(I assume you will attack one of my large ships, say my r3)
 
3)
sacrifice r2 MinktakaIII
attack r3s smokeytroll42
attack g3s smokeytroll42
 
If you build a y2 now, my second move will put 4 yellows in your home, and you can trigger a yellow catastrophe and attack my r3. My backup plan will be something like
 
2)
trade r3 g3 Babamots
 
3)
sacrifice y3 Vulcan
move g3 Babamots Vulcan
move g3 Vulcan smokeytroll42
move r3 Vulcan smokeytroll42
 
I would need to trade the r3 for g3 (or b3) so that you couldn't destroy my invading ships by trading your home g3 for r3.
 
I hope you've enjoyed the game. Playing a losing game over the course of weeks can be very frustrating.
	Babamots: "Measure of a Man" is usually my favorite episode.
	smokeytroll42: Well we can just call it then. To be fair, since Im still new to the game, Im not seeing my own demise so clearly, so its not really a big deal. Plus, the only to get better is to keep playing. Im up for a rematch if you are. As always, I appreciate the advice.
	Babamots: I'm happy to play again. If you'd like to look for another player of similar skill level, you could make an undirected challenge (nothing in the "Challenge whom" section) and in the "Notes" section say you're looking for another newish player.
	smokeytroll42: Ok, I sent you the challenge. Ill give that try next time I start a new game.
