1) alnith: Homeworld B2 R1 G3
	bhorner: Looks like I'm going first.  The commands are listed at the top.  You can abbreviate, and I usually abbreviate maximally.  For example these are equivalent:
verbose:
  homeworld r2 b1 g3
abbreviated:
  h r2 b1 g3

2) bhorner: Homeworld R3 B1 G3

7) alnith: Build G1 Alnith
	bhorner: The history here is good for going back to find where you messed up too.  Plus having more time to think about your move is nice.  :)

8) bhorner: Build G1 Bhorner
	alnith: Do they keep the logs after the game ends? It might make for some nice training data.
	bhorner: Yes, forever, I've downloaded all the games.  I used it to test my rules evaluator when I was trying to make an AI.  :)

11) alnith: Build G1 Alnith
	Draw5PlayAll: How many people are making AIs for this game?!
And how many people are actually getting anywhere?
	bhorner: I know of several attempts, not aware of any getting anywhere.  The branching factor grows too fast for standard tree searching techniques (like for chess).

12) bhorner: Build R2 Bhorner
	Draw5PlayAll: More manageable if you do it by individual actions rather than turns, but still very high.
