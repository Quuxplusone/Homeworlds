	dlwillson: Excellent play! Totally didn't see it coming!
	Draw5PlayAll: All just yellow ships at blue systems??

31) Felix: Attack Y1 Felix
	dlwillson: Interesting... I'm not sure why that worked.
	Felix: I believe they changed the rules so that it's now possible to cause a catastrophe during a turn instead of only at the end. This more closely reflects the official rules, I think, and I like it, because it opens up more strategic opportunities.
 
AMAZING defense. I thought there was no way out of my attack!

32) dlwillson: T Y3 G3 Dlwillson
	Felix: I don't know if it will save you in the end, but it was an awesome play.
	Draw5PlayAll: One ship!!!

33) Felix: Move G3 Felix Dlwillson
	dlwillson: I'm sure it won't save me, and I'm pretty sure it's not legal, with or without cats in the middle of the turn. The cat should have sent my homeworld back to the bank.
	Felix: Ah, yeah. You're right. You should have been eliminated immediately after that catastrophe and before you moved your other Y3 home, but if the system will accept it, I'm happy to play it out!

34) dlwillson: B G1 Dlwillson
	Felix: And I think that will do it. Really great game. That was an exciting finish, and I look forward to our next rematch!

Attack G1 Dlwillson
	dlwillson: GG! See you in a week or so! :-)
	Felix: See you then! Or feel free to start up a non-ladder game with me any time :)
	Draw5PlayAll: The rules say you can temporarily abandon your homeworld at any time.
