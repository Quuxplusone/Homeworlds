	Laurie_Menke: LOL... Probably just the stupidity of a not-so-great Homeworlds player.  I'm just trying to monopolize reds so you can't use them against me.  ;o)

Catastrophe Laurie_menke Yellow

	ajo: I think you've got about two turns left at this point. Getting a monopoly on red would only really have worked if I didn't already have some. ;)

35) Laurie_Menke: Attack B1 Laurie_menke
	ajo: Checkmate. Good game. :)
	Laurie_Menke: Naw, just trying to build up a fleet again without risking catastrophe.  And I am absolutely sure that you've won, but I don't see it quite yet.  I figure you're trying to cause a catastrophe in blue, but you're not quite there yet.  So I will congratulate you on the inevitable win, but could we play it out so I can see what your plan is?
	Laurie_Menke: Oh... wait... just saw it.  You'll sacrifice your g3 and build more blue.  Got it.  Well, thanks for a great game!  Congratulations!  :o)
