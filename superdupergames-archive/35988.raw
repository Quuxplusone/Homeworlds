	Babamots: If anyone was watching, this was a test of circumstances under which SDG will let you abandon your homeworld. I haven't found any conditions that will cause SDG to prevent you from killing yourself.
	Draw5PlayAll: Have you tried sacrificing your last ship and then not returning? Have you tried causing a catastrophe that (1) destroys all your ships, (2) surrenders control to your opponent, or (3) destroys your own last star?
	Babamots: I should check those. Thanks for the ideas! So far, SDG has allowed every type of suicide.
