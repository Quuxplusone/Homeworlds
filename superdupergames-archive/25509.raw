	Laurie_Menke: Sometimes this game makes me feel very stupid.  :o/  Nice move!

44) Laurie_Menke: Build G1 Laurie_menke
	Otts: There is too much to think about here.  I don't know that I'll ever reach the point of being ready to play this game in person again because of it.  I am learning though.  I've seen the early scramble to get into the 3rd non-red color twice from you now, and Andy did the same to me in person, so I'm finding that to be something to watch out for.  I'm also finding the red power to be almost too powerful.  With the ability to sacrifice one small red for an attack anywhere on the board, I don't know that I'd ever go as long without getting my hands on one again.  This is one dynamic game!
	Otts: ..And I wouldn't say it should make you feel stupid.  This game has so many options, it almost depends on someone making a mistake, or missing out on noticing someones intentions, to create a crack of opportunity.  Those cracks can be certainly tough to seal, however!  

45) Otts: Move G1 Old_yeller Laurie_menke
Catastrophe Laurie_menke G
	Laurie_Menke: You are very kind...and observant and a quick study!  If you enjoy the game, then don't give up!  You are very talented!  You keep whooping me soundly, and *I* play Andy all the time.  He makes short order of everyone.  Don't let that experience sour you.  You're right that there are tons of options, which is what makes the game fun and interesting...if a bitof a brain burner.  ;o)  And you're right that it's hard to recover from goofs, which is what makes it frustrating.  :o/  But you should definitely explore your theory about red.  Most players don't see it as particularly powerful or necessary early on, but you are better at this than most players.  :o)  Anyway, if it's more work than fun for you, then absolutely move on to more fun!  I've definitely enjoyed the challenge you've provided!

	Otts: Thank you back for the kind words and gracious games!  I'm not soured from getting whipped in person, nor ready to give up on my homeworlds experience just yet!  I'm going go try to teach a friend how to play, but I think I'll be back for another rematch soon if you're interested!
	Laurie_Menke: Sounds good!  Anytime!  Just ping me on FaceBook so I know you've challenged me.  Congrats!  :o)
