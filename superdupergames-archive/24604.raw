7) wil: Build G1 Wil

8) Broccoli_Commander: Build G1 Broccoli_commander
	wil: The goal, videos which teach the intracies of games of homeworlds.   The concept, ask the main players of homeoworlds what they consider some memorable games, where they were eitther trounced by something they didn't see coming or outplayed, or played a very good game themselves against an admirable foe...  And then the game will be recreated with a play by play analysis and commentary by the creator of the pyramids against the creator of the game Homeworlds.....   You pick the game number (from the archive) and if you wish we give you credit for your half of the game....  If you'd like to participate, send me the game link, and a short paragraph indicating what makes that game memorable in your mind, and it will be submitted, (you can send more than one, for different reasons, (use of factory, bluebird, the transport, catastrophes, doomsday machine, domination by controlling one color/economy, etc) .... Care to submit?
	Broccoli_Commander: Heh nice project! Are you its instigator?
I might submit, but I'll need some archive browsing time... deadline?

9) wil: Build Y1 Wil
	Broccoli_Commander: Well in #23216 vs ts52 I had a funny opening that led to a yellow monopole. But while I thought it was "brilliant" at the time, I'm not sure anymore... I mean the point of the opening is rather obvious...
	Broccoli_Commander: In #23213 vs SilentTitan I was really helpless after turn 8 already: he had set up himself nicely for a blue monopoly and caught me totally unprepared.
	Broccoli_Commander: Finally #23269 vs SilentTitan was also funny:
He played for a yellow monopole (pretty much as I tried in #23216) and I went for a green monopole. 
 
I barely managed to prevent his yellow monopole and then he went for a preemptive y cat at my homeworld.
 
A terrific war followed that I could only win by "teleporting" g2 repeatedly (s g2, b g2 elsewhere + build anywhere) and because I had built the lone r1 of the game somewhere.
 
If you want to look at one game only I would suggest this one :) But the other two are fun too I think. Note that I won't be offended at all if you judge that none of them are worth for the project ;)
	wil: Wow, thanx for the quick response....they are gonna be excited!  
 
no deadline, yes I am instigating, the idea is to review them and pick ones to add 'color commentary' them thinking outloud about moves and what they do to figure out what to do next...

10) Broccoli_Commander: Discover G1 Broccoli_commander B3 Blueberry

11) wil: Build Y2 Wil
	Broccoli_Commander: Hehe I could not resist going through the old games again ;) Hence the quick reply. But this is really a nice idea! Did you get support from other people of the community already?
 
Another thing I've been thinking about is a smartphone version of homeworlds! It is a hobby of mine... I dunno if there would be any interest from the community and/or creators of the game, though?
	wil: Oh we've been drooling of the concept of an app....where you could drag and drop ships from star to star, to and from the bank....real time reactions and a live chat feature with players....an actual coin to move to lock in your play....it would be amazing...you have that talent??

12) Broccoli_Commander: Trade G1 R1 Blueberry

16) Broccoli_Commander: Build G1 Broccoli_commander
	Broccoli_Commander: Hell I'm not on top of this game :D :D :D :D
 
Hey nice to hear that there would be excitement about an app! I was wondering which platform would be the best... Basically iOS is the most convenient because they provide servers for matchmaking whereas (as far as I know) we need to provide our own server on the other platforms (android, windows phone, ... )
 
Now I'm definitely not ready to invest money into this, so I think I would do it for iOS. Do you have an iPhone?
 
The other possibility would be to make a plain windows game; but I guess mobile platforms are preferred nowadays?
 
But otherwise yeah I would be able to make it (hopefully :D)
